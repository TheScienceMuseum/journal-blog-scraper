Although not the first woman in England to do so \u2013 the French sisters Rosine and Leonora Simonet had already made separate ascents with the balloonist Jean-Pierre Blanchard the month before \u2013 Sage was still among the pioneers. Indeed, the world\u2019s first crewed, free-flying balloon flight had occurred less than two years earlier on 21 November 1783, when a balloon designed by the French\u00a0Montgolfier brothers was launched in Paris.", "Sage wrote (and later published) a remarkable account the day after her own exploit: A Letter, Addressed to a Female Friend. By Mrs. Sage, The First English Female Aerial Traveller . It makes for a highly entertaining read about the pleasures and indeed the perils faced by early balloonists.", "Sage herself was very much aware of the \u2018melancholy fate of poor Pilatre de Rozier\u2019, who had become the first ballooning fatality only a fortnight earlier when his balloon caught fire and crashed. Still, Sage was not to be deterred, declaring that \u2018I never had, since I first took up the idea, the least apprehension of danger\u2019.", "The launch site was St George\u2019s Fields in Southwark, on the south side of London\u2019s River Thames. A rotunda had been constructed around a stage and gantry from which the balloon was to ascend. The \u201cpilot\u201d was to be Vincenzo Lunardi , an Italian aeronaut who had already flown a balloon in September 1784 \u2013 with a cat, dog and pigeon for company!", "Sage and Lunardi were also to be joined by one Colonel Hastings, another unidentified lady, and Lunardi\u2019s assistant George Biggin armed not only with meteorological instruments but also a \u2018manly and becoming fortitude\u2019.", "Unfortunately, the balloon was unable to launch with so many passengers \u2013 even after the unidentified lady had already disembarked. Sage\u2019s own rather buxom figure may not have helped matters; tactfully describing herself as \u2018 en-bon-point \u2019, she later referred more explicitly to her \u2018 two hundred pounds of human weight \u2019.", "Lunardi, perhaps forgetting that he was chiefly responsible for flying the balloon, gave up his own place for Colonel Hastings \u2018with a polite liberality that did him credit\u2019. In the end, though, it was only to be Sage and Biggin who took to the air , at about 13:25 with the crowd looking up \u2018in fixed and extatic [sic] attention\u2019.", "After a shaky start during which, Sage tells us, the balloon actually started to descend rapidly towards the crowd, they ascended. She and Biggin were carried westward more-or-less above the Thames, taking in the views of Westminster Bridge, St James\u2019 Park and Piccadilly, and \u2018the beautiful appearance of Battersea Bridge\u2019.", "They even sat down to enjoy some ham, chicken, and a glass of Florence wine (evidently these \u201cessentials\u201d hadn\u2019t been jettisoned in the efforts to lighten the balloon prior to launch), before tossing the bottle overboard.", "Sage included meteorological readings in her account, periodically throwing pieces of paper into the air to help establish the direction of travel. Biggin also had a thermometer and hygrometer to measure temperature and humidity respectively. He would have had a barometer, too, had Sage not accidentally broken it earlier in the flight.", "Still, there were other observations to make: he rang a small bell to see if there was any difference in sound (there wasn\u2019t), and used an electrical conductor to investigate the electrical properties of a passing cloud. At one point they flew directly through cloud \u2013 Sage reporting that she \u2018was very cold for above five minutes, and felt a little difficulty in respiration; but it was not an unpleasant sensation\u2019 \u2013 and even through snow.", "About an hour into the flight, the balloon turned north-north-west and eventually landed in a field near Harrow-on-the-Hill, well beyond London\u2019s outskirts at the time. The landing was anything but smooth: such was the force of the wind that Sage struck and injured her foot against a piece of iron, and a man on the ground attempting to help proved \u2018of no service, as he was laid flat on his face\u2019. It took several more onlookers to help bring the balloon to a stop, but not before most of them had been dragged along behind it for a distance.", "Even then, the excitement was not over. The master of the fields, whom Sage described as \u2018one of those beings, who, though they bear the external marks of humanity, have very little of the real character in their soul\u2019, became \u2018abusive, and savage to a great degree\u2019 when he saw the apparently \u2018 trifling injury done to his property\u2019.", "Thanks in large part to the arrival on the scene of the pupils and master of nearby Harrow School, the tension was diffused, and the balloon thus saved from destruction. Sage and Biggin then enjoyed an evening of local hospitality, \u2018many flattering attentions\u2019 and \u2018rustic compliments\u2019, before returning to London \u2013 this time, by land.", "Early hot air ballooning certainly divided opinion. While some argued for its merits as a feat of aeronautical engineering and a tool for making scientific observations, others dismissed it as a frivolous pursuit ripe for satire in the press. The craze for \u201cBalloonomania\u201d, though, was tangible: flights were commemorated in paintings, prints, and medals, on fans, items of clothing, snuffboxes and tableware.", "For herself, Letitia Ann Sage felt \u2018more happy, and infinitely better pleased with my excursion, than I ever was at any former event of my life\u2019. Evidently, her neighbours were equally captivated: \u2018The door is never quiet a single instant\u2019.", "You can find out more about early ballooning ephemera by exploring the Science Museum\u2019s Penn-Gaskell Collection online.

To do this, he devised an instrument that could take photographs of the spotty patterns made by scattered X-rays, called an X-ray spectrometer and the original (1910-1926) can be seen on display in the Science Museum\u2019s Making the Modern World Gallery .", "The other three pioneers in his book \u2014 Max Perutz (1914-2002), John Kendrew (1917-1997), and Dorothy Hodgkin (n\u00e9e Crowfoot, 1910-1994) \u2013 put this technique to work in biology.", "In our collections, you can see Hodgkin\u2019s molecular models of penicillin and insulin , while on display in Medicine: The Wellcome Galleries , stands Kendrew\u2019s model of the muscle protein myoglobin , where the supporting rods are easier to see than the model itself, and nearby is Francis Crick and James Watson \u2018s molecular model of the DNA double helix, which revealed how heredity is passed down the generations. All these structures were determined by X-ray crystallography.", "With these molecular models came understanding of how they worked. Take the example of haemoglobin, the red pigment in blood. In 1959, Max Perutz determined its molecular structure by X-ray crystallography, revealing it contains four atoms of iron, each held at the heart of an array of organic rings called a porphyrin, responsible for the red colour. That arrangement allows oxygen to \u2018look but not touch\u2019 and bind reversibly, so rust does not result.", "Once you know the structure, you can understand how a genetic mutation in the gene for haemoglobin causes sickle cell disease, or why carbon monoxide is lethal.", "Dame Mary and Sir John also discussed how the technique of X-ray diffraction has in part been overtaken by an extension of electron microscopy, called cryo-EM, which is now reaching atomic resolution , though Sir John believes there will still be heavy demand for conventional X-ray diffraction from pharmaceutical companies.", "Cryo-EM was pioneered by Richard Henderson at the MRC\u2019s Laboratory of Molecular Biology , LMB, in Cambridge, an institution that has garnered many Nobel prizes for uncovering the chemical structures of life, including one for Henderson himself.", "In their discussion, Dame Mary and Sir John ranged from Dorothy Hodgkin\u2019s inspirational story and the creative culture of the LMB to his unease about the effects of Brexit on international collaborations, such as work on synchrotrons, intense sources of X-rays, and at the Institut Laue-Langevin, a research reactor in Grenoble that is used as a powerful source of neutrons.", "They also touched on Sir John\u2019s extraordinary career which had unpromising beginnings near Llanelli, South Wales, where his father and brother were miners.", "The options at that time were \u2018to become a preacher, teacher or work underground,\u2019 Sir John recalled.\u00a0 His brother was 12 years his senior, and he reflected that if their births had been reversed, \u2018I would have ended up a coal miner and he a professor. He was a very intelligent man, as was my father.\u2019", "Sir John\u2019s interest in science was kindled as a teenager by his physics teacher at Gwendraeth Grammar School. \u2018She was astonishingly good, talking about the great scientists such as Newton and Rutherford and at length about Michael Faraday. I was enthralled when I heard her describe how this man who had left school at the age of 13 with little knowledge, other than arithmetic, became a bookbinder\u2019s assistant and then ended up being one of the greatest scientists of all time.

That\u2019s where I did a good deal of mineralogy also. And that is where my work on defects attracted the attention of Cambridge.\u2019", "It also caught the attention of the prestigious Royal Society. In 1977 he was elected a Fellow and, the following year, he joined the University of Cambridge as Head of the Department of Physical Chemistry, where he overlapped with Dame Mary in the late 70s/80s and continued working on new techniques such as neutron scattering ( on which I did my own research ) along with nuclear magnetic resonance, to study zeolites.", "In 1986, BP used one of his patented acid catalysts to make hundreds of thousands of tons of ethyl acetate \u2013 in a single step \u2013 within the biggest plant of its kind in the world.", "The same year, he was invited to succeed Nobelist Sir George Porter as Director of the Royal Institution.\u00a0 At this time, Sir John began using synchrotron radiation and devised techniques which combine X-ray spectroscopy and high-resolution X-ray diffraction to determine the atomic structure of the active sites of solid catalysts as they worked.", "He also devised new mesoporous, microporous, and molecular sieve catalysts, and \u2018single site\u2019 heterogeneous catalysts, which have uniform sites where the catalysis takes place.", "In 1987, the BBC televised his Royal Institution Christmas Lectures on crystals, with David Phillips , continuing the tradition of lectures for children started by Faraday in 1826.", "Sir John resigned as Director in 1991, due to his wife\u2019s poor health, but remained associated with the Davy Faraday Research Laboratory of the Royal Institution until 2006. In 1991 he published the book Michael Faraday and the Royal Institution: The Genius of Man and Place.", "After a time as Deputy Pro-Chancellor of the University of Wales (1991\u20131994), Sir John returned to Cambridge in 1993 as Master of Peterhouse, the university\u2019s oldest college, until 2002, the year his wife, Margaret, died.

Looking through two eyeholes the surgeon sees a 3D image of the inside of the body, provided by an endoscopic camera on one of the arms of the patient cart.

After discussing how the reputation of NHS glasses had evolved from a much-despised medical appliance to a retro fashion accessory a lady shared a personal anecdote with me. She had worn NHS glasses as a child but her mother had insisted she removed her spectacles before leaving the house so that the neighbours did not see. The style of the frames was so recognisable as state-supplied spectacles that they had evolved into so-called \u2018 badges of poverty \u2018.", "A factor that contributed to this social stigma was there were only a few styles available and those hadn\u2019t been updated in forty years.

Yet, a few hundred years ago, amulets were a legitimate part of medicine. Indeed, in the early modern period (around 1500-1750) amulets were objects used to heal or protect a body or home. They could be made from a huge range of materials be that natural or humanmade, and often worked in ways that were not fully understood.", "The amulets on display in Medicine , help show us just how diverse healing used to be. Today, we mainly focus on curing illnesses once we\u2019re sick but hundreds of years ago in England, medicine was much more about preventing illness and misfortune, as well as restoring health. Amulets played a significant part in this maintenance of a healthy body and mind.", "A great example of this is that Samuel Pepys, the Member of Parliament and early modern diarist famous for recording his account of the Great Fire of London in 1666, carried with him an object we may immediately recognise as an amulet \u2013 a hare\u2019s foot. But contrary to popular belief, Pepys didn\u2019t see his hare\u2019s foot as a lucky object, or as something that might ward off illness.

Are the many piecemeal actions of this kind enough to leave us feeling confident?", "The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has recently confirmed the likely consequences of continuing to pump greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere. As a global community, we are about as well informed on climate science as we might hope to be. But the uncertainties that surround climate change still leave us guessing where things are likely to come out.", "There are three big uncertainties. The first is how fast humanity will cut carbon emissions. For the moment, we are on track to double atmospheric carbon dioxide by some point in the second half of the century. The second is how the climate will respond. A widely used indicator is the change in global average surface temperature when carbon dioxide concentration doubles. The best estimate is in the range 1.5 to 4.5 degrees centigrade. The third uncertainty is the impact of such a change on future human wellbeing and the material damages it might cause.", "In the absence of stronger action than is currently evident there is a finite risk that we could hit 4 degrees of warming in the second half of the century, with the possibility of amplifying feedbacks locking in further temperature increasing processes over which we would have no control. The resulting climate changes would play out over centuries and millennia, producing permanent climate instabilities and shifts not experienced over human history.", "Risk could be reduced by policy changes among the principal emitters. By far the simplest action would be an agreed price for carbon emissions to accelerate the piecemeal transformation of energy infrastructure already underway. We might also get lucky if it turns out that the response of the climate to emissions lies at the lower end of the range. We should know where we stand in the next few decades. Meanwhile we might reasonably spend a moment on the implications of a 4 degree world.", "Here we are again beset with uncertainty.

Nor do we know how climatic zones may shift or how higher average temperatures and rainfall will combine with more frequent weather extremes and changing weather patterns to disrupt water supplies and agriculture.", "The pattern of cereal production could be significantly affected. Cereal demand may double by 2050 in response to population increases and changes in food preferences. This demand might be met by improved technology and waste elimination. Weather extremes and instability at 4 degrees may cut crop yields significantly, creating a further gap to be filled, perhaps by genetically improved robustness and the cultivation of newly productive northern lands.", "Geo-engineering might provide a temporary window of opportunity for a crash programme to decarbonise economies and sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide, although with a substantial risk of unintended and unwelcome consequences. On the other hand we might have to cope with disruption triggered by populations seeking to move from areas rendered inhospitable by inundations, floods, drought, extreme temperatures, fires and local shortages of food and water.", "How all of this will play out is clearly impossible to say. Optimists believe that with luck, free markets and technological ingenuity we could rise to a 4 degree challenge if we can\u2019t avoid it altogether. Pessimists argue that 4 degrees is beyond adaptation and may lead to a period of dislocation. Either way our lives are likely to be transformed in the next few decades as we thoughtfully re-engineer food and energy production and relocate climate migrants or rather more chaotically seek to respond to the multiple pressures of population growth, energy needs and climate disruption.", "The UK is relatively small, open and unprotected and may not do well in the face of climate disruption.

The radio operator used a morse key (a simple on/off switch) to interrupt the sparks in the form of morse code. The resulting coded radio wave \u2018oscillations\u2019 could be heard by other ships within a radius of a hundred miles or so. This was the method of transmission in use at the time of the Titanic disaster in April 1912.

Incredibly, humans have been creating rubber for over 3500 years.", "The first use of rubber was by the Olmec people (Rubber People) of South America. They would boil natural latex, a milky sap-like substance, which they \u2018tapped\u2019 from the rubber tree Hevea Brasiliensis , and mixed with the juice of a \u2018morning glory\u2019 vine.

However, they were far from perfect as they melted in hot weather and smelled very bad!", "Charles Goodyear and Thomas Hancock are responsible for producing the rubber we know today. In the 1840s they heated it in combination with sulphur to produce vulcanised rubber, strengthening it greatly.

But Higgs has always called it the scalar boson or, jokingly,\u00a0\u2018the boson that bears my name\u2019 and remains genuinely embarrassed that it is named after him alone.", "In fact, three different research groups, working independently, published very similar papers in 1964 describing what\u2019s now known as the Higgs mechanism.

Will we have to build an even bigger machine that smashes subatomic particles together with ever-greater energy? In fact, Peter Higgs believes that the next big breakthrough may well come from a different direction altogether, for example by studying the behaviour of neutrinos , the elusive particles believed the be the most common in the Universe, which, as Higgs admits, \u201cis not the sort of thing the Large Hadron Collider is good for\u201d.", "When it started up in 2008, physicists would not have dreamt of asking for anything bigger than the Large Hadron Colider. But today one hears serious talk of designing a machine that might one day succeed it. One candidate is the somewhat unimaginatively named Very Large Hadron Collider. Such a machine would dwarf the Large Hadron Collider. It would collide protons at seven times higher energy than the maximum the Large Hadron Collider is able to reach. And it would require a tunnel 100 km in circumference. Of course this is not the only proposal on the table and there are plenty of other ideas floating about \u2013 none of which come cheap, naturally.", "There are certainly plenty more deep mysteries to solve, from the nature of dark matter and dark energy to where all the antimatter has gone , and we will undoubtedly find the answers (oh, the delicious arrogance of science).

Immediately after WW2 Britain was one of the few European nations that didn\u2019t need a joint accelerator, as it already had its own large facilities, and there was much discussion before signing the CERN convention. Although UK universities and industrial partners were major players in building the Large Hadron Collider , they might not have been involved at all. Jon showed us a 1984 letter, preserved in the National Archives, in which Margaret Thatcher \u2013 who trained as a scientist \u2013 expresses doubt about \u2018extravagant\u2019 collaborative projects.

The artist Robert Wilson worked with a sound designer to create a series of stories that you wandered through as a visitor, each like exquisite tableau.", "There were a series of these kind of events in the late 80\u2019s early 90\u2019s and I spent my student years assisting Hildegard Bechtler on a few of her pioneering projects, where she took over buildings to subvert the theatre and create more of a total experience for the audience from the moment they entered the theatre building. It is tremendously exciting to use this in exhibition design years later.", "Do you think that the mixture of theatre and exhibition works?", "I think that it really works, and for me it is about helping the visitor engage with the content of exhibitions. In a theatrical setting people can have an emotional sensorial connection \u2013 through sound, smell, touch \u2013 and once engaged they can spend time to understand and interpret the meaning of the objects or artefacts.", "I feel that there is a lot of scope in this \u2013 and exhibitions are becoming different to what they used to be.

The result is the first direct evidence for inflation, the theory that the Universe expanded unimaginably fast, an infinitesimal instant after time zero.", "The theory of inflation states that the Universe grew in volume by about a factor of at least 10 78 ,\u00a0a number so vast that it\u2019s impossible to comprehend (its roughly equal to the number of atoms in the universe). This phenomenal expansion took place in an incredibly short time, in about ten billionths of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second, at a time when the Universe was cold, dark and empty. To put this in context, if the full stop at the end of this sentence were to grow by the same factor, it would end up about a hundred times larger than our galaxy.", "Inflation is a crucial part of modern cosmological theories and solves many serious problems with the traditional Big Bang model, but so far there has been no direct evidence that it actually happened. However, inflationary theories predict that this violent expansion would have created ripples in space and time known as gravitational waves. These ripples would then have echoed through the cosmos, leaving a mark on the oldest light in the Universe, the Cosmic Microwave Background ( CMB ).", "Discovered fifty years ago by the American radio astronomers Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson (who at first mistook it for pigeon poo in their receiver), the CMB is the remnant of the light emitted 380,000 years after the Big Bang, when the Universe cooled enough for atoms to form and for light to travel freely across space. The discovery of the CMB was one of the most important events in the history of science, providing convincing evidence that the Universe began in a violent hot expansion known as the Big Bang. This ancient light has been stretched from a searing hot 3000 Kelvin to a freezing 2.7 Kelvin by the expansion of space, leaving it as a faint microwave signal coming from the entire sky.", "The BICEP2 telescope is based at the Amundsen-Scott station at the geographic South Pole, where temperatures plummet to below minus 70 degrees Celsius in the Antarctic winter and the base is buffeted by blizzards and gale force winds. Despite these incredibly hostile conditions, the BICEP2 telescope is in the perfect location to study the CMB.", "The South Pole is around 3000 metres above sea level, and the driest place on Earth, meaning that there is relatively little atmospheric water vapour that would otherwise screen out the CMB signal. This comes with the added advantage that BICEP2 is able to scan the same small piece of sky all year round, by effectively looking straight down from the bottom of the planet to the point known as the celestial south pole.", "BICEP2 astronomers spent almost three years scanning the CMB in incredible detail, but yesterday the freezing conditions and hard work paid off spectacularly as they revealed subtle twists in the CMB, a smoking gun for gravitational waves from inflation. In fact, the BICEP2 astronomers were surprised by just how strong the signal was. \u201cThis has been like looking for a needle in a haystack, but instead we found a crowbar,\u201d said co-leader Clem Pryke.", "Although the result hasn\u2019t been peer reviewed or published in a scientific journal yet, most astronomers agree that the findings look solid. The fifty-strong BICEP2 team have been sitting on their historic result since the end of 2012, and have spent more than a year checking and rechecking to ensure they have taken account of every possible effect, from gravitational lensing to space dust, which might have given a false result.", "So what does this mean for our understanding of our Universe? The BICEP2 result is really three Nobel Prize -worthy discoveries in one. They have found the first convincing evidence that inflation really happened, giving science its first glimpse of the moment in which the universe came into being. Second, they have found the strongest evidence yet for gravitational waves, the last prediction of Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity to be verified, and something that astronomers have been searching for for decades. Third, and by no means least, this discovery demonstrates a deep connection between quantum mechanics and gravity, giving hope that we may one day find evidence of a theory of everything, a theory that would unite our theory of particles and forces with our theory of cosmology and gravity. This would undoubtedly be the greatest prize in science.", "If confirmed by other observatories, this incredible result will go down in history as one of the most important scientific discoveries of the 21 st century, eclipsing even CERN\u2019s discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 . Nobel Prizes will almost certainly follow. More importantly, this result opens up a new window through which astronomers and cosmologists may, for the first time, glimpse the very moment of creation.", "Explore more about astronomy in our Cosmos and Culture gallery and discover the mysteries of deep space\u00a0in our Hidden Universe 3D IMAX film."]},

The decision was highly symbolic and political, and Gagarin\u2019s working class upbringing and photogenic smile were just as important as his ability to withstand the extreme conditions of spaceflight.", "He was 27 years old the day of his legendary flight, dressed in a bright orange spacesuit and a helmet inscribed with \u2018CCCP\u2019 painted in red.

My parents, who were children in the Soviet Union at the time of the launch, remember the day with great clarity.

Watching the cloud forms through his window, Gagarin told his ground control unit how beautiful the Earth looked.", "Despite the worldwide attention, Gagarin\u2019s flight had been shrouded in secrecy, especially his landing, the details of which were not released until the 1970\u2019s. Most of the world was told that Gagarin was inside Vostok-1 in a complete process from take-off to landing.

Our current system ensures that almost no waste is sent to landfill. What can\u2019t be recycled is sent to Grundon\u2019s highly efficient energy from waste plant, where with the increasing value of some of the raw materials means that our waste can become products that have a second, third or even fourth life after leaving the museum. Keeping waste to a minimum is an important part of the story, and through procurement we encourage suppliers to minimise both the travel distances for their products and the packaging associated with them.", "Across our group of Museums, sustainability initiatives over the last year have seen many successes: at Wroughton, biodiversity actions have brought two poor-condition County Wildlife Sites into a land management plan.

It\u2019s been surprising, sometimes shocking and certainly thought-provoking, fun, hard work and, at times, a little bit smelly!", "We\u2019ve documented all the rubbish produced by the Museum\u2019s 281,647 visitors, 500+ staff and contractors, five caf\u00e9s, two building sites, three shops, two Science Nights , one Lates event and several storage cupboard clearances. We\u2019re still waiting to see the figures but, it\u2019s safe to say, it was a lot of rubbish.", "Over the thirty days, artist Joshua Sofaer , his assistants and the Science Museum volunteers, along with hundreds of brave visitors eager to take up this unique opportunity to get up-close and personal with the trash, have rummaged tirelessly through approximately 250 bags of rubbish per day.", "Along with the expected items like crisp packets, drinks cans and the remains of thousands of kids\u2019 lunch boxes, we\u2019ve also found some more unexpected objects hidden amongst the detritus of everyday Museum life. 16.5 pairs of shoes, two two-piece suits, a bra, three fridges, one dishwasher, a box of old floppy disks (visiting school children didn\u2019t know what they were), piles of discarded over-the-counter medicines, three wheelchairs and a staggering volume of disposable cutlery.", "So, what have we learnt from all this investigating and documenting? Aside from the revelation that kids don\u2019t eat the fruit in their packed lunch (one day I\u2019ll count the number of untouched apples we documented), the most obvious thing is that we don\u2019t recycle as much as we could.", "Over the last few months the Science Museum has been working hard to put new systems in place for separating our rubbish both in public spaces and offices. The addition of recycling bins in public areas is a long overdue step forward for the Museum but we found that almost all recycling bags in public areas were contaminated with non-recyclable rubbish, so we need to do more to encourage and help visitors to recycle while they are here.", "The amount of recyclable material lost to incineration because we are not yet separating caf\u00e9 waste is a lot more than we would like but there are plans in place to roll out new segregation systems to all the Museum\u2019s caf\u00e9s in the near future. Just separating out the caf\u00e9 food waste could reduce the Museum\u2019s general waste tonnage by around a third.", "Whilst the documentation was taking place in the Museum, behind the scenes we\u2019ve been doing some detective work to find out where and how those materials are processed and what they go on to become. These days, very little is lost to landfill so most of the rubbish that left the Museum has been transformed into some other physical form, either through recycling or through incineration.", "That transformed rubbish is now travelling back to the Science Museum, to be reunited with some of the most interesting items we retained from the bins. Over the next 10 days, Joshua Sofaer will be creating an exhibition showcasing what is produced from our rubbish, examining the beauty and value of the materials but also looking at the sheer volume that was produced over one month.

I like the idea that with a little bit of effort and imagination, items that would otherwise be chucked, can be turned into something desirable. Unfortunately the collection of items in the box that I had gathered didn\u2019t look at all desirable. A couple of umbrellas, some bits from a light fitting, an old copper funnel, an ash tray, some plastic cutlery, some glass cups and a selection of ball bearings didn\u2019t look very promising.", "The germ of my idea came from digging out the copper funnel and investigating it further. It was heavily corroded and covered in green verdigris, but underneath was structurally solid, and a beautiful shape.", "I read somewhere that vinegar could be used to clean copper, so I popped down to the caf\u00e9, to get a couple of sachets to try out. It turns out it does a reasonable job on lightly tarnished areas, but can\u2019t handle the extent of corrosion on the funnel. However, it did encourage me that the funnel could be saved.", "Next I pulled apart the umbrellas, lined up everything from the box and had a think what I might make. A happy coincidence was that the handle from the umbrella fitted exactly into the top of the funnel.", "My first thought was to make some sort of loudspeaker people could shout through. Next, I thought the umbrella handle might plug the funnel to make a water-tight vase or container of some sort.", "Finally, looking at the shining clean patch of copper I thought, coupled with a 1950s-style squirrel cage bulb, it might make a really nice light fitting.", "The next step was to recondition the copper funnel.", "In the basement, the Museum has metal and wood workshops responsible for building, installing and maintaining the structures for new exhibitions. Amongst their equipment is a sandblasting machine, which I used to blast the corrosion from the funnel.", "I decided to leave the matt finish left from the sand blasting on the inside surface, and polish up the outside. Using Brasso and eventually a buffing wheel I polished up the outer surface.\u00a0To ensure the lamp remains pristine, I decided to use a polymer based lacquer, applied in the workshop\u2019s spray booth.", "Finally I added the umbrella handle, and a lighting flex and fitting.

It aims to examine what constitutes the waste that passes through the Museum, where it would normally go, and what might be usefully recycled.", "The exhibition is split into two parts. The first involves the collection of every piece of waste generated by the Museum over a month. A team of volunteers has been sorting and photographing the contents of the Museum\u2019s rubbish bags, and pulling out items of particular interest. The second part will start on 25 July, and will be an exhibition of cleaned and collated rubbish materials.", "As I began my shift, what struck me first was the smell of the gallery. It\u2019s a sweet, fruity smell, not unlike over-ripe apples. It comes from the vast amount of sugary drinks and half eaten fruit thrown into the bins, the likely source being the hundreds of packed lunches eaten in the Museum every day. Throughout the Museum, the usual bins have been replaced with \u2018General Waste\u2019 and \u2018Recycling\u2019 bins. It soon became clear to me that in order to avoid the worst of the smell, the bags to pick out to sort through are the ones marked \u2018Recycling\u2019. This avoids the majority of the decomposing foodstuffs.", "The task is to open up the bags, lay out the contents on a large white table, sort the contents as you see fit, and then snap a photo of the arranged items on an overhead camera. The opportunity to arrange the rubbish in whatever way you want has brought out the creativity of the volunteers. To this end, within a few days, a tumblr account was opened to show off some of the most imaginative of the layouts. Amongst my favourites are the seascape, composed of blue plastic bags and fruit, and blazing sun in the sky, made from bread sticks, paper towels and what looks like parsley. You can have a look here .", "After half a dozen bags, a disheartening pattern starts to emerge. Much of what is being thrown away is perfectly good. Lots of the food is unopened or untouched. Leaflets and flyers are almost always pristine. It\u2019s as though the bins are being used to de-clutter, rather than being a place to put things when they have reached the end of their useful lives. It seems inexplicable how many of the items have ended up in the bins. Three wheelchairs have been collected, over a dozen shoes, two fridges, a bra and a giant toothbrush.", "Spurred by the some of the weird and wonderful items collected I have set myself a challenge.

Gone are the sorting tables, bin bags and faint whiff of old packed lunch; in their place Joshua has created an intriguing and magical exhibition showcasing 30 days of Science Museum rubbish.", "The exhibition is comprised of some of the bizarre and surprising items that were retained from the bins in the documentation phase of the project, displayed alongside almost 18 tonnes of materials processed and recycled from the Science Museum rubbish. Both the scale and the beauty of these materials and objects is quite unexpected, and I don\u2019t want to ruin the surprise, so I\u2019m just going to give you some teaser images (below).

This has enabled us to work out what materials to bring back for display, and in what quantities, to represent 30 days\u2019 worth of Science Museum waste.", "Rubbish leaves the museum via a variety of different companies but the vast majority is taken by Grundon Waste Management. It goes to their site at Colnbrook, near Heathrow, which holds three centres; a transfer station, a Materials Recovery Facility and the Lakeside Energy from waste plant , co-owned by Viridor Waste Management.", "Today I\u2019m going to focus on the materials on display from the Energy from Waste plant. When you think of an incinerator that burns rubbish you might picture a dirty, sooty, very smelly and unpleasant place, but it\u2019s actually an extraordinary, almost clinically clean building (except for the container where the rubbish is held), and it\u2019s surprisingly beautiful with a giant claw grabbing up to six tonnes of rubbish at a time to feed the incinerator fires.", "All the Science Museum general (non-recycled) waste goes to Lakeside to be incinerated. Four products come out of that process: energy, incinerator bottom ash, air pollution control residue and clean air. The largest output is energy, with the plant providing enough to power 50,000 homes per year. We have calculated that the energy produced by incinerating one month of Science Museum waste is enough to light one of our gallery bulbs for nearly 24 years.", "The energy is produced by burning the rubbish for approximately 3 seconds at 950 degrees centigrade, which is long enough to combust most materials. At the end of the process, incinerator bottom ash is left over. This ash still contains large pieces of metal which are separated and sent to be recycled, and the ash itself is left to \u2018mature\u2019 so that chemical reactions can take place that lower its pH value. This aggregate is then used in the construction industry, primarily in road building. You could be driving on your old rubbish.", "One of the most remarkable things about the incineration process is that the air that comes out of the plant is actually cleaner than the air that goes in. This is because it is very carefully filtered to contain the toxins released during burning. The filtered ash is known as air pollution control residue (APCr). Historically this toxic ash would have been contained in hazardous waste landfill, but new technologies and research are now finding uses for it. Grundon have invested in a company called Carbon8 who use carbon dioxide to neutralise the toxic heavy metals and materials, making them permanently non-hazardous. This safe ash can then be used as an aggregate and, alongside other recycled materials including wood, makes the \u2018Carbon Buster\u2019 carbon-neutral breeze blocks we have on display in The Rubbish Collection.", "It\u2019s been very encouraging to find that the Science Museum rubbish is producing some useful and valuable products through incineration. However, one of the big findings from our documentation of the Museum\u2019s waste was that there is still a lot of recyclable material ending up at the incinerator. Those materials retain much more value when they are recycled so by continuing to improve and refine our recycling systems, and through new initiatives like separating our food waste, we hope in the future to decrease our general waste further.", "Phase 2 of Joshua Sofaer\u2019s The Rubbish Collection is now open at the Science Museum and runs until 14 September 2014."]},

Once the world\u2019s most powerful radio transmitter, its very low frequency waves could follow the curvature of the Earth to travel very long distances , enabling one-way communication to Britain\u2019s Empire. It transmitted wireless telegraph messages from the British Foreign Office, standard time signals from Greenwich, news bulletins, personal telegrams and Christmas greetings.", "Although first hailed as a matter of national pride, in later years Rugby Radio Station was a hidden secret that played an important role in the Cold War, as its very low frequency signals could be picked up by submarines.", "Godfery Dykes, one of many submarine communication operators, sat in a claustrophobic communications cabin, hunched over the radio, headphones on, sick bucket between his legs, receiving the Morse code signals. His role was to write down in pencil the dots and dashes coming through at the incredible speed of 30 words a minute, a rate that was undecipherable to the untrained ear.

To top it all off, at $899 the Simon was simply too expensive for most people to justify.", "Despite its imitations and brief foray in the marketplace, the Simon brought together many of the key things that underpin today\u2019s smartphones. The next big splash in the market came over a decade later. By then, 3G mobile phone networks were available, online app stores were a genuine possibility and microprocessor technology had advanced enough to pack a really powerful computer into a small handheld device.", "The IBM Simon will go on display in the Science Museum\u2019s Information Age gallery\u00a0which opens on 25 October 2014."]},

Upon arrival at the plant, the WEEE waste can be safely handled and recycled into new usable raw materials.", "What is WEEE waste?", "Every year, people in the UK buy around 1.5 million tonnes of electrical and electronic equipment, like toasters, TVs, washing machines and computers. We throw away about one million tonnes of equipment, so WEEE waste is one of the fastest growing waste streams in the UK and in the EU. It\u2019s important that we take action now to stop it from piling up.", "Some of the components used to make electronic goods can be hazardous and harmful to the environment, while others can be recycled and reused. Some are even precious and contain gold, silver, indium or palladium. It\u2019s amazing to think that WEEE contains 40 times more gold than gold ore!", "What are the biggest challenges faced by the industry in recycling and recovering these materials?", "A big problem is the difficulty in separating the complex scarce trace metals using the technology currently available. Different proportions of trace materials are present in different bits of WEEE and some materials bind together, making separation a challenge. \u00a0At present, only a tiny percentage of these metals is captured in the recycling process, so it isn\u2019t sustainable.", "What can people do to help?", "Just as we separate our plastic bottles and tins from paper and compostables, we need to separate our old electrical appliances and take them to a local recycling centre.", "As with electricals, it\u2019s easy for batteries to end up in landfills if the proper recycling channels are not used.

This ensures the batteries are recycled responsibly.", "Our top three tips are:", "What do you think the industry will be like in 50 years time?", "To meet the new EU directive we need to recycle 85 percent of WEEE generated in the UK by 2018. The value of WEEE will be higher as there will be less rare metals and raw materials to extract from the Earth. \u00a0Advances in technology will mean that electrical goods will be even lighter, more compact and flexible.

Born on this day (17 September) in 1857, the man\u2019s name is Konstantin Tsiolkovsky .", "Tsiolkovsky\u2019s contribution to the science of space travel is diverse and astonishing, with his work ranging from robust science to science fiction. Citing the work of Jules Verne as a personal\u00a0 inspiration , Tsiolkovsky believed science fiction was a valuable tool in advancing and popularising\u00a0 serious scientific ideas. Subsequently, Tsiolkovksy himself produced three sci-fi novels, and towards the end of his life acted as technical advisor on the production of the Soviet sci-fi film \u2018 Cosmic Voyage \u2019 (1936).", "However, Tsiolkovksy\u2019s prominence in the field of space travel is due to his work on the mathematics and mechanics of \u00a0how to reach outer space. He famously calculated the possibility of doing so by using liquid-propellant rockets. In addition to developing concepts on launch and orbital dynamics, Tsiolkovksy considered devices that would allow a human being to survive in space, including space suits and space food.", "Tsiolkovsky\u2019s achievements are even more extraordinary in light of his circumstances. Growing up in a large family of limited means and suffering from severely impaired hearing after contracting scarlet fever as a child, Tsiolkovsky was self-educated. After a brief period in Moscow where he taught himself mathematics, physics, astronomy and chemistry using public libraries, Tsiolkovsky returned to the provinces to become a school teacher and start a family.", "Fleeing a bleak existence, he immersed himself in a world of inventions, struggling to get his work published \u2013 he was essentially founding a new field of science \u2013 but doggedly self-publishing when possible and gaining local followers intrigued by his ideas of metallic air ships, extra-terrestrial life and the colonization of other planets.", "Tsiolkovsky\u2019s work was driven by the idea that space travel would allow the human race to abandon Earth in the face of overpopulation and natural catastrophes, thereby securing the continued existence of humanity. He envisioned a species of super humans, a form of eugenics drawing on the likes of Nietzsche that does not tend to sit comfortably with those eulogizing his life and work in modern times. These super humans would use Earth as a source of energy and raw materials and cosmic evolution would eventually allow them to shed their physical \u201cshells\u201d and develop into energy, becoming immortal and boundless.", "Despite receiving minor recognition from the state following the Russian Revolution of 1917, Tsiolkovsky\u2019s situation remained relatively unchanged until he neared the end of his life in the 1930s when he was officially hailed as a hero.", "Following the launch of the Soviet space programme in the 1950s, he went on to achieve cult status.

This ambiguity made it a great tool for us to draw visitors into the centre of the gallery and make them question their preconceptions of modern communications. It is a world away from the common communication devices that spring to mind \u2013 mobile phones, micro-chips and digiboxes.", "We learnt that the tuning coil was housed underneath a copper shroud \u2013 we think to dissipate heat and prevent the timber structure from igniting. This provided us with a material that resonated with the object\u2019s history and a warm, reflective surface for the display. The coil is located where visitors can learn about the transmitter, signal and receiver.", "From the centre you can see that the gallery is divided into six networks \u2013 each one telling stories from a specific section of communication technology. Placed around the outsides of the gallery, similar to the idea of a town square or plaza, we placed large double height display cases. These display structures are designed to house a vast array of objects.", "These display structures serve several purposes. One function is to hold up the elevated walkway that encircles the gallery. More importantly, they allow visitors to engage with the incredible objects and stories told in each of the six networks. For this reason, they became known as storyboxes. To provide a varied experience, both a producer and a \u2018voice\u2019 were assigned to a storybox for each network, creating an installation of their conception.", "The sheer quantity of objects on display within the gallery required meticulous planning of the space.", "Stories with large numbers of objects fill showcases, which in turn create smaller spaces and routes throughout the gallery. A key concern was to ensure visitors knew where their attention should be focussed, especially in a gallery without a prescribed route.", "We crafted a space that used solid forms and open apertures within the gallery, providing clear groups of objects along with vistas from one section to another.", "Lastly, we designed a large encircling walkway that loops around the gallery. We introduced this to provide an overview of the space and an alternative perspective of the gallery. We felt it was important for visitors to understand the context of each story within the scheme of the gallery \u2013 allowing them to connect objects from one end of the space to the other.", "Fundamentally, this is a gallery about incredible objects, people and stories.

But what we don\u2019t often recognise is just how much contemporary British manufacturing has (literally) smashed these conventions into pieces.", "Many people think Britain doesn\u2019t actually make things anymore, but the reality is very different. Making things and selling them around the world remains strategically important for Britain, and its resilience continues to draw many manufacturing companies back to the UK after relocating to the Far East.

All the history books repeated the Museum\u2019s assertion about its originality and yet there was no real evidence to confirm it.\u00a0I decided it was time to find out for certain.", "I researched the whole story again, this time using only contemporary records such as Cooke\u2019s letters, other manuscript documents and press reports. After much work, I concluded that the large dial was almost certainly one of the two 1837 originals, whereas the smaller instrument was likely to be one of the working models made for demonstration at a High Court hearing in 1850 when a rival company was disputing Cooke and Wheatstone\u2019s priority in the invention.", "The layout of the dial was Wheatstone\u2019s idea. Any of the 20 letters on the dial can be indicated by making the appropriate pair of needles point to it. No knowledge of a code is needed and the dial is big enough for a crowd of people to see it working. Then as now, good salesmanship was needed to put over new technology.", "So why is this discovery so important?", "The electric telegraph was the first practical use of electricity and from the 1840s onwards it transformed world communications. After a transatlantic telegraph cable was laid in 1866, messages between Europe and North America took only hours to arrive rather than weeks. Moreover, Cooke saw the emerging railway system as a major customer for the new technology. To operate safely, the railways needed to observe a timetable based on a standard time system.", "The electric telegraph enabled Greenwich time to be distributed right across Britain, and within a few years local time, based on the times of sunrise and sunset, had been replaced by standard (Greenwich) time. The telegraph could also help catch criminals. In 1845 a message sent from Slough railway station to Paddington enabled murder suspect John Tawell to be identified, arrested, and in due course, executed.", "After many years of doubt, I am now satisfied that one of the key inventions from the beginning of electric telegraphy has been authenticated and rightly takes its place in our new Information Age gallery.", "John Liffen is the Curator of Communications."]},

The Medical Times and Gazette defended Liebreich, insisting that his close associations with the German school were to be of huge importance to the fledgling hospital. They reasoned that in order to advance St. Thomas\u2019s, and English ophthalmology in general, they had to \u201cbegin by assimilating all that Germany\u201d (and hence Liebreich) had to teach.", "Upon leaving his post at St Thomas\u2019s Hospital in 1878 Liebreich slowly withdrew himself from the influential central spheres of ophthalmological medicine, focusing his energies instead on the impact optical disease had on the paintings of artists such as J.M.W Turner.

By the time of the 1858 transatlantic cable, their system had been developed and widely adopted for railway signalling across Britain.", "American experimenter Samuel Morse (of Morse code fame), was also working on developing telegraphy. His system used a single circuit to send an electric signal along a wire to a receiver at the other end. Instead of using needles indicating letters of the alphabet, Morse\u2019s system used a code of dots and dashes to spell out words. Morse received funding to use this technology to set up a telegraph system between Washington and Maryland in the USA. The telegraph became an instant success. People relished the ability to send and receive information much more quickly than before, and as a result the telegraph system expanded across America and Europe.", "Soon after, in 1856, the Atlantic Telegraph Company was set-up with the objective of laying a cable across the Atlantic Ocean, connecting America with Europe. Luckily, opinions of the technology were high, which meant shares in the company sold quickly. As soon as enough money was raised, the first transatlantic cable, consisting of seven copper wires and recorded as weighing one ton per nautical mile, was laid from America to Ireland.", "Queen Victoria sent the first official transatlantic telegram. She sent a message to US president James Buchanan congratulating him \u2018upon the successful completion of this great international work.\u2019 \u00a0The message\u00a0travelled\u00a0through 2,500 miles of cable and took 16 hours, a dramatic improvement on the 10 days it would have taken\u00a0beforehand. The same message was repeated back to Valencia in Ireland in only 67 minutes.", "Unfortunately, the success enjoyed by this first transatlantic cable did not last. There were problems with the cable, and within a month it had failed completely. However, the desire for speedy transatlantic communication was great enough to attract more funds to try again. \u00a0A further attempt in 1866 was successful.", "The consequence of this new form of communication was huge. By the end of the 19 th century, new technologies began to emerge. The telegraph was replaced by telephony and these days we rely on the internet for high speed communication. However, the telegraph was the first technology that allowed us to communicate quickly and reliably over long distances, and acted as a turning point in communication history.", "You can explore more about the laying of the first transatlantic cable in our Information Age gallery, which opens on 25 October.", ""]},

The truth is that now I just want to get to the end of it and for nothing to have gone wrong. I\u2019m looking forward to looking back and for nobody to have succumbed to any of the long list of potential hazards that we had to consider on our lengthy risk assessment.", "The project to document and display 30 days\u2019 worth of Science Museum rubbish started several years ago. For the first years, I spent my time trying to convince scientists, curators, managers and pedagogues that it would be a fantastic idea to let members of the public get elbow deep in the museum rubbish before displaying it all in galleries that are normally reserved for precious and unique objects. Once they agreed I suddenly had a panic, as I was forced to seriously consider all the things that could go wrong: \u201cBut what if\u2026?\u201d", "Over the 30 days of the first phase with 4 assistants, 30 Science Museum volunteers and the help of over 400 visitors, we collected, laid out and documented all the rubbish produced by the Science Museum\u2019s: 281,647 visitors 500+ staff and contractors 5 caf\u00e9s 2 building sites 3 shops 2 Science Nights 1 Lates event \u2026and several storage cupboard clearances.", "We had predicted that around 28 tonnes of rubbish would be thrown out but it was actually closer to 33 when we got the figures back from the Science Museum\u2019s main waste contractor Grundon .", "We brought over 18 tonnes of materials back to the gallery for the second phase of the exhibition, including: 7.4 tonnes of paper and card reels 2.4 tonnes of bottom ash aggregate 2.3 tonnes of glass sand 1.4 tonnes of wood 1 tonne of fertilizer 698 kilograms of steel 650 litres of dehydrated sewage sludge 291 breezeblocks made from air pollution control residue \u2026and nearly 1 tonne of various recycled plastics.", "Items that we retained from the rubbish included: 3 fridges 1 dishwasher 3 kettles 3 wheelchairs 1 sleeping bag 1 mini snooker table 16.5 pairs of shoes 2 two-piece suits and ties 1 bra 1 negative pregnancy test 1 love letter \u00a340.16 \u2026and a crazy amount of disposable cutlery, usable stationery and discarded medicines.", "Whether disgusted or curious, everyone it would seem, has an opinion about rubbish. We are all throwers away. The psychological desire (and most often the psychological effect) of throwing something away, is to forget about it. We throw something away precisely because we don\u2019t want to think about it any more. I have loved watching the faces of the Science Museum visitors as they realise that they are looking at what we have collectively tried to forget. There are moments of surprise and moments of recognition. Reactions have perhaps been strongest when confronted with the sewage.", "The Italian artist Piero Manzoni cleverly played with the reverence that is accorded to the artist and the art object by producing a number of actions that resulted in sculptural provocations. Merda d\u2019Artista (or Artist\u2019s Shit ) is what is says on the tin: 30g net freshly preserved, produced and tinned in May 1961. The performance is of the artist\u2019s action that we are asked to imagine: that of him taking a dump. Manzoni places this object on a gallery plinth in a simultaneous act of gross self-aggrandisement and fierce condemnation of the gallery system. By making shit art, Manzoni cleverly manages to critique what he also aspires to (and has subsequently achieved), the reified status of the artist.", "In the Science Museum we have on display not just a tin can but a large gallery vitrine full of human waste: 650 litres of dehydrated sewage. This is perhaps the ultimate waste, the stuff we really want to forget. But when our poo is pushed in our faces it asks us to think about what we choose to keep, what we choose to get rid of, and what happens to our stuff once it has left us.", "I would like to thank the Science Museum for allowing this to happen. I would like to thank the many waste contractors who have been involved. I would like to thank all the assistants and volunteers who tirelessly sorted through bags of caf\u00e9 waste late into the evening after the museum was shut. I would like to thank you, the Science Museum visitors for donning gloves and getting stuck in and also for throwing things out, without which there would have been no project. Only, paradoxically, that would be better: the very thing that this project has relied on \u2013 that people throw stuff away \u2013 is also the thing we want to reduce. Let\u2019s work towards a time when a project like this is unnecessary or even impossible. Disposal is the last resort.", "Continuing our look at climate and sustainability, our Antenna team will be bringing Bio-Bean \u2013 recently announced as winner of the Postcode Lottery Green Challenge \u2013 to the Museum from next week.

That would stop insects from attacking the collections, but unfortunately would also be extremely harmful to humans.", "Nowadays, a crucial part of pest management is monitoring. It is essential to do regular checks of the stores and have a general idea of the insect populations. We must spot any areas of concern and stop the pests\u00a0before it\u2019s too late.", "In order to do this, we place many insect traps throughout our stores. We use two types of insect traps: sticky traps, which insects get stuck to as they pass; and pheromone traps that attract and trick male moths looking for a nice smelling mate. You might have seen some of these traps around museums.", "Identifying these little creatures can be quite fun, yet often challenging, as most of them are very small and often get destroyed in the traps themselves.", "How do they get destroyed? (Turn away now insect lovers) Well, some poor creatures simply pull themselves apart as they walk through the traps, while others are found snacking on the unlucky guy stuck next to them. Often, we can only see half the insect, or a mass of various insects and arachnids together, which adds to the challenge of identifying them.", "Even though adult insects are dangerous because they can reproduce, they don\u2019t often eat our collection. It is their larvae that are more damaging; their ravenous hunger can be extremely destructive.", "Whilst many insects aren\u2019t directly harmful to our collections, they do tell us important information about environmental conditions in our stores. If we know, for example, that a specific insect thrives in particularly humid conditions, we can make assessments about those areas of the stores. We can also see which areas of the building are particularly easy for insects to enter.", "Of course, it is impossible to prevent all insects from entering our stores. Our aim is to provide conditions that are not welcoming to pests: storage areas are kept at lower temperatures to stop insects thriving, and good hygiene and housekeeping are also crucial, as insects love messy, dark and undisturbed areas.", "It is worth remembering that while pests can be a danger to our collections, there\u2019s a lot of information we can learn from them too.", "To meet some usual pest suspects, visit this website designed by Birmingham Museums and Art Galleries.", "Fabiana Portoni is a\u00a0Collections Care Conservator at the Science Museum."]},

Four days later we docked at Immingham, cleared customs and then drove down to London.", "The next challenge was unloading the spacecraft at the Museum.\u00a0Due to their sheer size and weight, we used cranes to lift the spacecraft off the trucks, but even just moving the spacecraft through the Museum was no mean feat.", "Long before the spacecraft left Moscow we did a practice run with a giant beach ball, which had the same dimensions as the Vostok 6 spacecraft, to see which display cases and furniture would have to be moved along the route.", "Then finally the spacecraft had to be hoisted up to the first floor of the Museum and moved into the gallery.", "One of the star spacecraft in Cosmonauts (and that is saying something) is the extraordinary LK-3 Luna Lander.\u00a0This is a 3 tonne, 5m tall training model of the spacecraft that would have landed a single cosmonaut on the moon.", "Due to its ginormous size, the Lander had to first be dismantled at the Moscow Aviation Institute in order to be transported to London.\u00a0In fact, this is the longest journey the Lander has ever taken.", "At the beginning we didn\u2019t think the Lander would fit into the Museum, but thankfully the Lander can be dismantled into sections: a top, middle, bottom and four legs, or in more technical words, the docking port, cabin, engine and four landing pads.", "A week later, and inside the Science Museum, we reassembled the Luna Lander.

Written by the young British physicist Paul Dirac , it was simply titled A Quantum Theory of the Electron , and was nothing short of a theoretical triumph.", "In it, Dirac had set out to solve a problem that was occupying some of the greatest minds in physics. To date, quantum mechanics had failed to explain the fine detail of atomic spectra \u2013 the discrete wavelengths of light emitted and absorbed as electrons hop between different energy levels in atoms. In particular the electron had to be given a strange property known as \u201cspin\u201d to explain the number of different energy levels.", "Spin itself was a rather mysterious quantity. It suggested that that the electron behaved as if it was rotating rapidly on its axis, but a quick calculation showed that this couldn\u2019t be true \u2013 the electron would have to be spinning faster than the cosmic speed limit, the speed of light, something forbidden by Einstein\u2019s theory. It also had to be bolted on to quantum mechanics like a clumsy afterthought, without any explanation for its origin.", "Dirac , for whom mathematical beauty in the laws of physics was almost a religious cause, was deeply dissatisfied with this awkward situation. He believed that the problem lay in combining the two pillars of modern physics, quantum mechanics (the theory of the very small) and relativity (the theory of the very fast).", "He was after an equation describing the behaviour of electron that was consistent with both theories, and also explained the known properties of the electron. Rather surprisingly perhaps, the approach he took was to guess.", "An educated guess mind, based on some properties he knew the correct equation must possess and also on his aesthetic desire for simplicity and beauty. Working methodically, he tried equation after equation, discarding them one by one until in late November 1927 he came upon a solution.", "The equation was perfect. Not only did it accurately reproduce the known energy levels of the hydrogen atom, the property of spin naturally appeared in the equation, without the need to be stuck on by hand afterwards. Spin itself now seemed to be an inevitable consequence of combining relativity and quantum mechanics.", "Dirac , though famously reserved, must have been jumping for joy (though perhaps only in his head). He had pulled off a coup so impressive that his German competitors, Jordan and Heisenberg were left stunned and deflated.", "As news spread of Dirac\u2019s success, the man himself was growing increasingly nervous about an odd feature of his equation, one that he had brushed under the carpet in his Royal Society paper.", "The equation itself had four solutions, and each solution represented a state that the electron could be in. Two of these corresponded to the garden-variety electron with negative electric charge, but the other two described an electron with positive electric charge and negative energy.", "This made no sense whatsoever. No one had ever seen a positively charged electron, and worse still, if these negative energy states existed then ordinary electrons should be able to fall into them, causing an electron to spontaneously switch its charge from negative to positive.", "For all the success of the Dirac equation, these negative energy electrons could well have spelt its doom, and no-one was more acutely aware of this than Dirac himself. In fact, this \u201cproblem\u201d turned out to be Dirac\u2019s greatest contribution to physics.", "It would take Dirac more than three years to understand the true meaning of this extra set of solutions. He had first thought that these negative energy, positively charged electrons might in fact be protons \u2013 the positively charged particles inside the atomic nucleus \u2013 but he soon realised that this would imply that protons should have the same mass as electrons, when in fact they are roughly 2000 times heavier.", "What Dirac eventually reasoned was that these odd solutions actually represented a completely new type of particle, a sort of mirror image of the electron that he dubbed the \u201canti-electron\u201d. Anti-electrons would look completely identical to ordinary electrons, but positively charged. He also reasoned that other particles like protons should also have anti-versions, and that when a particle met its anti-particle they would annihilate each other.", "This must have seemed far-fetched at the time; after all, no one had ever seen an anti-particle. But Dirac was convinced by the beauty of his equation, and in one of the most stunning episodes in modern physics, was proven right just a year later, as Carl Anderson spotted an anti-electron in cosmic ray experiments .", "It\u2019s hard to overstate what Dirac had achieved. Through the power of sheer thought, he had predicted the existence of a completely new type of stuff, a stuff never before imagined by scientists. This stuff, what we now call antimatter, is just as real as the stuff you and I are made from, but for some reason doesn\u2019t exist in large quantities in our Universe. This is in fact one of the greatest unsolved mysteries in physics, and one that physicists at the Large Hadron Collider are trying to solve.", "Find out more about antimatter by watching this short video or by visiting the Collider exhibition before the 5 th May 2014."]},

Despite the many legends that surround Leonardo, Kemp said that \u201cthe reality beneath the stories is no less exciting, as the Science Museum\u2019s new exhibition Leonardo da Vinci: The Mechanics of Genius makes abundantly clear \u201d.", "Last night the formal opening of the exhibition was attended by around 400 people, including Paul Kahn, UK President, Airbus Group; Professor Sir Christopher Frayling, British educationalist and writer; Carole Souter, Chief Executive of the Heritage Lottery Fund; Sir Peter Bazalgette, Chair of Arts Council England; Sir Vernon Ellis, Chairman of the British Council; Anthony Geffen, CEO of Atlantic Productions; Professor Frank James of the Royal Institution; and Dame Mary Archer, Chair of the museum\u2019s Board of Trustees.", "Although it is harder to categorise Leonardo\u2019s genius than many realise , it took centuries for his engineering skills to be as widely appreciated as his artistic skills. Leonardo\u2019s thought processes lay hidden after his death in 1519, aged 67, when his manuscripts and collections were inherited by his apprentice and friend, Francesco Melzi.", "On the instructions of Leonardo, Melzi had produced a Treatise on Painting which was published in 1651 and thought to be authoritative until the 19th century, when scholars realized it did not capture many of the insights held in his notes. Kemp described how these drawings show how Leonardo \u2018visualised machines with a brilliance that no one else had ever done, and drew them with a presence and potency that no one else had ever done\u201d.", "These \u2018thrilling\u2019 works show how, more than his contemporaries, Leonardo was capable of creating what Kemp called \u2018mental sculpture,\u2019 visualising motions in different planes, as moving three dimensional objects. \u2018No one quite drew machines quite like Leonardo did.\u2019", "Leonardo devised graphical techniques to show the components \u2013 \u2018elementi\u2019 \u2013 of machines, such as screws, gears and springs, and how they worked together in kinetic sculptures. In particular, his Madrid Codices manuscripts, discovered in the Biblioteca Nacional de Espa\u00f1a in Madrid in the sixties, provide what Kemp called \u2018ooo ahh\u2019 examples of Leonardo\u2019s machines.", "Leonardo did not just study birds and bats to imitate nature, which he regarded as design optimised to perfection, but tried to understand it from the basics, for instance the lift generated by a wing, so that he could \u2018then act as a second nature, inventingthings that nature didn\u2019t invent\u2019. In this way, said Kemp, \u2018you could create an infinite world of possibilities.\u2019 The theme of remaking nature influenced Leonardo\u2019s works of art too, such as the Mona Lisa.", "In the Science Museum exhibition, you can see many of Leonardo\u2019s drawings made real, using 39\u00a0 models that were first made in Milan in 1952 to celebrate the 500th anniversary of Leonardo\u2019s birth. \u2018Having these machines from Milan here is absolutely terrific,\u2019 said Kemp.", "Among the other near life-sized models are a pyramid-shaped parachute; a floating siege weapon for crossing moats, and a crossbow measuring almost three metres across. There\u2019s also his flying version of the \u2018Archimedean screw\u2019 that has been used since ancient times to draw up water: many call it a helicopter but Kemp pointed out that it was supposed to \u2018revolve furiously\u2019 so it was designed to transport the imagination with entertaining possibilities more than with a pilot in mind. And you can also see Leonardo\u2019s \u2018little bit crazy\u2019 ideas for stage designs too, added Kemp.", "The legacy of Leonardo\u2019s interest in the inspiration of nature lives on in fields such as biomimicry, where scientists try to solve problems such as flight by looking at how solutions have evolved in living creatures over many millions of years. We are still in thrall to what Kemp called the \u2018evolutionary magic of natural design.\u2019 The exhibition, which is supported by Airbus, also considers the influence today of biomimicry by exploring the iterations of his research in modern robotics and aeronautics, such as the wing rib of an Airbus A380 inspired by the wing of an eagle.", "Leonardo\u2019s reputation as an inventor grew in 1952, on the 500 th anniversary of his birth, with a major exhibition in London and Kemp paid tribute to the role in this earlier exhibition of the Science Museum, which has been described in the Science Museum Group Journal by Jim Bennett , who curated the small introductory display which commemorates this earlier exhibition.", "Though at the instigation of Mr Gilbert, a curator of the Science Museum,\u00a0 the quincentenary exhibition was held at the Royal Academy because it was thought a more appropriate venue: while Leonardo\u2019s drawing of the ideally-proportioned Vitruvian man went on to inspire the first Italian-language version of Vitruvius\u2019 De architectura, and he influenced future painters through his contribution to what is called the Maniera Moderna (modern style), his drawings of machines did not directly influence the history of science and engineering.", "Yet Leonardo was as fertile and great an inventor as Watt, whose workshop can be seen in the museum too , argued Kemp, referring to how he saw the Science Museum as a \u2018kind of paradise\u2019 when he visited as a child. This and the two anniversary exhibitions in the 1950s provide a \u2018historic connection\u2019 to\u00a0the one now in the museum.", "In the 1950s, Leonardo was seen as the isolated genius who invented everything from refrigerators to planes to whatever, said Kemp. But today we realise many of his more plausible devices are copies of the machines that he saw emerging as the Renaissance revolution unfolded around him. Leonardo was clearly working towards a treatise of visionary machines, such as the \u2018tank scuttling across a battlefield\u2019, intended as\u00a0\u2018visual boasting\u2019 to impress potential patrons, said Kemp.", "Today Leonardo\u2019s work retains the power to inspire, says Paul Kahn, UK President, Airbus Group. \u201cEncouraging young people to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering and maths is a key priority for companies like Airbus.\u201d He added that the Science Museum had a key role to play in this respect.", "Kahn praised the \u2018fantastic exhibition\u2019 that shows the \u201ctrue artistry behind engineering\u2026just imagine what he could have done with our R and D budget today.\u201d", "Ian Blatchford, Director of the Science Museum, told the audience at how a recent visit to India had brought home to him how Leonardo is a \u201cfigure of a global importance\u201d.

To fix the problem I used a \u2018consolidant\u2019 to treat the surface locally, which helped to stop the crumbling and stabilise the pannier for the future.", "Because of its age and how it was used, other areas of the leather \u2013 mostly the bottom edges and corners \u2013 had split and were lifting from the wicker interior. The location of the damage and the reduced flexibility of the material made this one of the trickier parts of the job.", "In some cases the treatment was as straightforward as sticking down the leather with an adhesive, but for other sections that were fragile and unable to bend I had to resort to humidification.

Although I have always been fascinated by robots I didn\u2019t actively study them until I came to Bristol 20 years ago. I was lucky then because firstly I had a chance to set up a new research group, and secondly I met 2 other people who were also interested in robots. Together we started the robotics lab. We were also lucky because we managed to win the money (grants) to do robot research projects \u2013 without the funding the lab would have been very short lived.", "Then, during the last 20 years my interest in robotics has changed, so that now I\u2019m much more interested in basic scientific questions, like what is intelligence, how do animals evolve, how does culture emerge and so on, and use robots to try and answer (in a small way) those questions. So what makes me want to study robots now is a deep interest in some of the big questions of life.", "What are swarm robots and what is it about them that fascinates you?", "A robot swarm is a collection of relatively simple robots that interact with each other and the environment in ways that are inspired by the behaviour of social insects. Complex group behaviours, like flocking, foraging for food, or nest building can emerge from the micro-interactions of lots of individuals.", "I\u2019m fascinated by swarm robotics for two reasons. Firstly, future real-world applications for tasks as wide ranging as robotic agriculture, waste processing and recycling, search and rescue, or planetary exploration and colonisation are likely to use swarms of robots. And secondly, by building swarms of robots we can start to understand how the processes of emergence and self-organisation work, and how to engineer systems using these mechanisms.", "Do you see a direct relationship between the swarm behaviour of robots and the herd like relationships of humans?", "Yes, social insects (and the robots inspired by them) are not the only animals that show swarm intelligence. The flocking of birds, shoaling of fish and herding of mammals are all examples of the same kind of group behaviour. Humans are complicated, of course, but some aspects of human crowd behaviour are almost certainly swarm-like.", "What are the ultimate goals and objectives attributed to swarm robotics?", "The ultimate goal of swarm robotics is to be able to engineer safe and reliable robotic swarms for real-world applications. As I mentioned in the answer above there are many challenging real-world (and off-world) tasks that would benefit from a swarm robotics approach. Basically any task that is distributed in physical space, where it would be better to have multiple robots (than having just one robot).", "Reaching this goal requires the solution of a number of difficult technical problems. One is how to design the behaviours of the individual robots so that when you put all the robots together in their working environment, they actually self-organise to complete the required task. The second challenge is how to design a human-swarm interface \u2013 in other words how would a human operator control and monitor a large swarm of robots. The third challenge is how to prove that the swarm of robots will always do the right thing, and never the wrong thing! And the final challenge is getting this all working in real-world applications so that people become confident in swarm robotics technology.", "Our view of robots is shaped by books and film \u2013 do you think this is helpful or misleading?", "Good question! I think robots in science fiction are both helpful and misleading. Helpful because many roboticists, myself included, were inspired by science fiction, and also because SF provides us with some great examples of \u2018thought experiments\u2019 for what future robots might perhaps be like \u2013 think of the movie AI, or Data from Star Trek. (Of course there are some terrible examples as well!)", "But robots in science fiction are misleading too. They have created an expectation of what robots are (or should be) like that means that many people are disappointed by real-world robots. This is a great shame because real-world robots are \u2013 in many ways \u2013 much more exciting than the fantasy robots in the movies. And the misleading impression of robots from SF makes being a roboticist harder, because we sometimes have to explain why robotics has \u2018failed\u2019 \u2013 which of course it hasn\u2019t!"]},

We all assume that there is a stream of consciousness going on in others when we observe them, and that imagination is in there too playing a part. All of this comes from the electrochemical signals swirling in our brains, and no one really understands how that all works yet, so it would be difficult to build a robot to mimic it directly.", "Of course we can build part of the computer program that takes input patterns and looks for similar patterns in stored or previously learned patterns, or just creates new random patterns to output and call it \u2018imagination\u2019, and in some way it is doing a bit of what our imagination does.

I quickly fell in love with the idea of building intelligent systems, so stayed in Birmingham to do a PhD in AI for video games. It was only a few years later when I joined an ambitious project that wanted to use some of the ideas from my PhD to help build a cognitive robot that I moved away from virtual worlds and built things that ran in the real world. From then on I was hooked on robotic research.", "How did you become involved in\u00a0using\u00a0robots for exploration?", "We were interested in studying how robots could automatically extend their own knowledge about their worlds. We already had a robot that could build maps of its environment, but it had to be directed by a human using a joystick. Therefore it seemed like a natural extension to see if we could get the robot to take over from the human and guide the exploration itself.", "What can Dora do?", "The Dora robot can explore space to build up a map. It can choose where to explore based on how likely it is that a particular direction of exploration will produce interesting results (like previously unknown rooms). Dora can also search for objects, either in order to tell a human where they are, or to work out what kind of rooms are in the building (e.g. if it sees a kettle it will realise it is in a kitchen). Dora can also interact with humans in a limited way, by asking questions about the location of objects.", "", "Do you think robots like Dora will become a household necessity?", "I\u2019m not sure they will become a necessity (unless we all become unable to care for ourselves!), but they will certainly become a luxury item in the future. It will be possible to order them from an online electronics store one day and have them arrive and start work the next. The big problem will then be training your robot to understand the layout of your home and the routines of your household.

Submitted by Steve", "The answer has to be no, as NASA has already sent two robots to Mars : Spirit and Opportunity. This has cost in excess of $900 million! One interesting question is not the cost of transport, but the difficulties of controlling robots once they get to Mars. The delay of a radio signal between Earth and Mars can be over half an hour, so this precludes any direct control by a human (just imagine playing a game where every command you send takes 30 minutes to have any effect!).

Unless you artificially restrict its mobility, Dora will just keep trying to explore until its batteries run out or it gets stuck somewhere. A few years ago we were demonstrating Dora in a corridor that led to some toilets. Someone had left the door to the women\u2019s toilets open, and before we knew it Dora had wandered off in there.

The main downside is that the reality of robotics research is a long way away from the images portrayed in fiction, so we risk disappointing people when we are unable to provide them with the robots that they imagine are possible.

How relevant is this and do you think this idea of robots in our pockets will have a wider impact on robotic research and developments?", "Whilst there have been consumer robots before Siri (including vacuum cleaners, lawn mowers and toys), the importance of Siri is that it demonstrates that it is possible to produce software that consumers can interact with about a range of tasks in a natural fashion (even if the results are not always perfect). Perhaps the biggest impact of the development of computers in our pockets will be the expectation that all our devices should share information to make our lives easier. For example my phone should know when I\u2019m nearly home so that it can tell a future version of Dora to put the kettle on.", "What are the ongoing cultural implications of your latest research?", "Robots will change the way we live and work. The change will start from limited, well-defined tasks (such as robots that clean the floor and cars that park themselves) but will gradually become more noticeable across the whole of society.

Without going into much depth on the topic (no pun intended), Carrey speaks about some of the issues facing our oceans and the organisms living in them today, adding a more serious message to the otherwise light-hearted film.

For those who haven\u2019t heard of the cuttlefish, its name is a bit of a misnomer. Cuttlefish are more closely related to snails than to fish, and are also a close relative of squids and nautiluses (two other sea-creatures mentioned in the film), and octopods. To avoid detection and attacks from larger males, smaller male giant cuttlefish disguise themselves as females, changing colour to match the females and hiding their extra appendage that the females lack. By doing this they can sneak past the larger males guarding the females. At this point they change the colour of the side of the body facing the female to the colouration of the males, all the while resembling a female on the other side of the body to fool the larger male. These \u2018sneaks\u2019 have remarkable mating success with the females, showing that size\u00a0isn\u2019t everything!", "", "The aforementioned cuttlefish, as well as corals and thousands of other species will be affected by ocean acidification, as we pump more CO2 into the atmosphere. The sea is very good at absorbing CO2, so as we increase the concentration in the atmosphere, the sea absorbs more and more. Although the chemistry of this is complicated, the result is simple: the pH drops (i.e. the water becomes more acidic) and calcifying organisms such as corals and cuttlefish could start dissolving over time. Atmospheric CO2 is currently 30% higher than at any time in the last 650,000 years, but ocean acidification and its effects on organisms is still poorly understood. However, in recent years, ocean acidification has received increasing levels of attention as an intrinsic player in climate change, allowing more funding for research into how it will affect marine organisms in the future. By increasing awareness through educational films such as \u2018Under the Sea\u2019, the youngest members of our population can grow up aware of the problems facing our oceans today and in the future.", "Flora Beverley is doing work experience at the Science Museum.

We use them in the morning to check our hair, in cars to avoid crashes and some buildings have them in corridors for safety. But there are some other, more mischievous, ways to use them. For example, our Grab the Bling exhibit in Launchpad uses a huge spherical concave mirror (one that bulges inwards) to trick people into thinking they can touch a desirable watch.", "In fact, the concave mirror produces something called an inverted real image of the watch. This means that the image of the watch is upside down compared to the real watch and is made by beams of light meeting at a single point in front of the mirror. People would then think that the image is the actual watch and try to snatch it, when in fact our watch is perfectly safe underneath.", "Mirrors are also used in our Seeing Through Walls exhibit which I like to use to pretend that I\u2019m Superman.", "Looking at the shape of the tubes, it\u2019s clear that light can\u2019t go up or through the wall and so it must go down.

But Geoffrey West, distinguished professor and past president of the Santa Fe Institute, New Mexico, and senior fellow at Los Alamos National Laboratory, is trying to find the laws at work in the real world, laws which govern the messy complexities of life.", "Over the past few decades West has compared the ways in which cities, companies, and organisms work and believes that each represents a riff on a universal theme, manifesting a surprising simplicity beneath their extraordinary complexity and diversity.", "An elephant is a scaled-up pygmy shrew, and London a scaled-up Taunton, where West was born, according to his book Scale: The Universal Laws of Pretty Much Everything.", "West has put together a grand synthesis of scaling (that is, how the various characteristics of a system change when you change its size) that provides surprising insights into why there are no mammals the size of ants, whether cities are glorified organisms and a framework for global sustainability.", "In his interdisciplinary search for the mathematical patterns underlying life, cities and commerce, West has garnered many awards in the fields of ecology, aging and mathematical biology, along with the accolade of being Time magazine\u2019s \u201cOne of the 100 Most Influential People in the World.\u201d", "The efforts to uncover the mathematical fabric of life began in earnest with the work of biologist D\u2019Arcy Wentworth Thompson, who a century ago published what West calls a \u2018wonderful book\u2019, On Growth and Form .", "Although West started out working on theories on quarks, gluons and string theory, he turned his lens two decades ago to the study of scaling laws in biology: it turns out that as animal size increases, almost all physiological functions, like heart rate, also scale in a systematic way from the intracellular level up to ecosystems over almost 30 orders of magnitude.", "All creatures, from pygmy shrews to whales, have equal lifespans when accounted in number of heartbeats: about 1.5 billion of them. West wanted to understand why this regularity holds true, even though organisms are so bewilderingly diverse, with varying adaptations, evolutionary histories, lifespans and survival strategies.", "He found that life is ruled by scaling relationships. These are not linear, when doubling one quantity doubles another, but non-linear \u2013 they tend to obey what are called power laws: a parameter will increase in proportion to size raised to some exponent, in the case of metabolism, three quarters.", "I first encountered Geoffrey West in 1997, when he and colleagues derived this factor of 3/4 from first principles, drawing on ideas about fractals in networks \u2013 self similar structures, from cauliflowers to clouds and, in this case blood vessel networks, consisting of branching structures, from the level of arteries down to capillaries.", "They assumed this network of vessels must feed every cell of the organism. Secondly, that they had the same basic units of cells, capillaries and so on whether mouse or whale. Third, that evolution has optimised them to get oxygen most efficiently to tissues and organs.", "The number four in this factor of \u00be turned out to be important because it represents the dimensionality of the space we live in plus one, to do with the fractal nature of these networks. This held the key to understanding the metabolic limitations of animals.", "He has applied this thinking in all kinds of circumstances, from the growth of ecosystem to cancer to the hours of sleep, to show why a mouse sleeps 15 hours and a whale just two.", "Even cities can be viewed this way. West does not regard them as mechanical entities but more like living organisms, constantly adapting and evolving.", "Within them, he suggests two interacting networks are at work: people and infrastructure so, for example, a map of lorry journeys looks a bit like a network of blood vessels.", "With this understanding, it turns out that if you know the population of a city you can reasonably accurately predict that features that are networked, so you can work out, as you increase city size, how many petrol stations there are, what is the total length of roads, electrical cables and so on.", "Once again, there are important economies of scale: a city that is twice as populous as another does not have double the infrastructure and productivity.", "The good news is it is more efficient, with less infrastructure than you would expect, along with more productivity per head.", "If you double the size of a city from 50,000 to a hundred thousand, a million to two million, five million to ten million, you get a roughly 15 percent boost in productivity, patents, the number of research institutions, wages and so on, and you get systematically a 15 percent saving in length of roads and other infrastructure.", "The bad news, however, is that cities suffer from more crime.", "Overall, he says, \u2018diseases spread faster, businesses are born and die more often, commerce is transacted more rapidly, and people even walk faster\u2019.", "This understanding of how city growth affects society and the environment is fundamental if we are to make modern life sustainable, he argues, because the fate of cities is \u2018the fate of the planet.\u2019", "Geoffrey West, will be discussing his book in the Wonderlab Show Space between 19.30-20.00, during Lates on 31 May."]},

The high ground of the ridge was the target of a major Allied operation as a preliminary to the Passchendaele offensive. You can see the map on display in Wounded ,\u00a0currently in the Mezzanine gallery at the Science Museum, and as you follow the blue line, you can see how it is intersected more densely as the front approaches. There is the trench network itself, a small gauge railway line leading to a casualty clearing station, and newly dug straighter tracks (marked in green) so that stretchers laden with their casualties could be carried easily and quickly away from the battlefield without having to turn too many corners.", "The attack on Messines Ridge marked a new phase in the Great War. In addition to the weeks of bombardment before 7 June, nine divisions of men were ready to be hurled at the enemy, nineteen deep gallery tunnels had been dug under the ridge leading to mine chambers packed with a million pounds of explosives. They were detonated just before dawn, in the largest man-made explosion to that date on our planet, its sound carrying from Ypres to London on the wind.", "When the dust settled, the ridge had almost disappeared. Allied forces moved forward to occupy the once-dominant German positions and scored one of the few unequivocal victories of the war. But from then on, through the summer and into the late autumn, the offensives slowed, bogged down in dreadful weather and appalling mud. Eventually there would be utter failure and no meaningful gains, in the end 70,000 British soldiers were killed and another 170,000 wounded.", "The map in the Wounded exhibition was drawn by a Regimental Medical Officer (RMO) in preparation for the attack on Messines Ridge, and would have been one of a number distributed to his stretcher bearer team leaders. This one is in perfect condition, the colours from the crayons used to mark the routes from the front to the rear are clearly distinguishable a century after its creation, so it must have been kept as a copy, in a personal or Field Ambulance record. At first glance, the map appears to be a tangle of lines but look more closely and we see careful preparation by a medical service well-used to attritional warfare: many medical relay posts set up and stocked with their supplies of dressings and morphia, multiple options for bearers running back with their patient on their stretcher, then going out again, picking up what they needed, or finding another relay post if where one had been destroyed or the pathways to it wrecked. It\u2019s a very precise document because men\u2019s lives literally depended on the RMO\u2019s cartographical skills and his bearers\u2019 ability to interpret them.", "Opposite the map in its case is an entirely different object but one every bit as important to the medical effort for the Passchendaele casualties: Oswald Hope Robertson\u2019s blood transfusion kit in its portable wooden case. The techniques of blood transfusions were still in development during the war and Robertson had been one of the very first to perform them in 1915.

In one 24 hour period, the field hospital where he worked admitted 1800 patients, there were simply too many for him to do transfusions for all of them, but he did his best to control their bleeding however he could.", "At Passchendaele, both medics and bearers must have felt as if no matter what they did, the deluge of the wounded and dying wound never stop.\u00a0 But they all worked on, and in doing so, transformed the prospects of military casualties then and ever since.", "", "There is a final detail on the map \u2013 almost unnoticeable unless you are looking for it \u2013 the name of the headquarters of the field ambulance: Kandahar Farm.

The short film, a rare copy of which has survived in the Jean Desmet Collection in the EYE Film Institute in the Netherlands , was released in 1912\u00a0and starred Spot, the Urbanora dog , as the Canine Sherlock Holmes of the title.", "The film combined a cultural recognition of Sherlock Holmes with the popularity of canine stars on screen. The latter trend may have begun with stray dogs wandering into the shot in early silent films but was rapidly superseded by the use of trained dogs in early twentieth century films and beyond.", "The earliest documented example of the use of trained dogs in film\u00a0was the 1905 British silent film \u2018 Rescued by Rover\u2019 where our canine hero tracks down a kidnapped child while the human members of the family are overcome with\u00a0grief and panic. Self-described as \u201cthe sensation of the new century\u201d, \u2018 Rescued by Rover\u2019 was written, produced, directed, and photographed by Cecil Hepworth \u2013 one of the founders of the British film industry \u2013 who also\u00a0starred in the film alongside his wife Margaret Hepworth and\u00a0their family dog Blair who played\u00a0Rover, as well as two professional actors.", "Such was the popularity of the film that it was re-shot two or three times when the film\u2019s popularity led to the negatives being worn out. The film also led to the name \u2018Rover\u2019 becoming a popular name for dogs and\u00a0Blair the dog has been celebrated as \u2018the first canine film star.\u2019", "Following in its footsteps, \u2018A Canine Sherlock Holmes\u2019 continued the popular trope of dogs outsmarting their human counterparts and additionally used the recognition of Sherlock Holmes to heighten\u00a0interest in the film. By 1912, when the film was released, Sherlock Holmes and the fictional detective genre were sufficiently well-known and understood for a slightly tongue-in-cheek, and blissfully copyright-unaware, doggy version to be released on film.", "Over twenty years before the release of \u2018A Canine Sherlock Holmes\u2019 , Conan Doyle first published works featuring Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson in \u2018 A Study in Scarlet\u2019 , published as a novella in 1886 and a year later as a short story in Beeton\u2019s Christmas Annual . \u2018 A Study in Scarlet\u2019 was written while Conan Doyle was running his private medical practice at Southsea. The medical practice was not particularly financially prosperous and so he\u00a0turned to his passion for writing to bring in a further income.", "Although Conan Doyle wrote a second Sherlock Holmes novel \u2018The Sign of Four\u2019 in 1890, he soon realised short stories provided\u00a0a better source of income. As a result, between 1891 and 1892 he\u00a0published the first twelve \u2018Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\u2019 stories in the Strand Magazine, which\u00a0were turned into a successful book of the same title in 1892. One year later in 1893, \u201cthe Baker Street mania\u201d was such that Conan Doyle killed off Holmes, hoping to concentrate on more serious writing. Public outcry forced him to bring the character back to life and continued to write and publish short stories, novellas, and novels on Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson alongside his more serious fiction and non-fiction writings.", "Conan Doyle had a strong interest in mysticism, spiritualism, and psychic investigations dating back to the early years of his Southsea medical practice in the early 1880s. It was also around this time that Conan Doyle privately declared his religious and spiritual beliefs to be \u2018Spiritualism\u2019 with the author publicly declaring these beliefs in the midst of the Great War in 1916, in part a response to the multitude of deaths in the war, including some witnessed personally on a visit to the Western Front in 1916.", "However, it was the later deaths of a number of close family members including his son and brother which further encouraged Conan Doyle\u2019s fascination with spiritualism: his son Kingsley died in 1918 from pneumonia, worsened by being seriously wounded in the Battle of the Somme two years earlier, while his brother Brigadier-General Innes Doyle , also died from pneumonia, in February 1919. Two of Conan Doyle\u2019s nephews had been killed earlier in the war: one was killed in action in July 1915, aged 20 while another died of wounds in September 1916, aged 28.", "It was said Conan Doyle found solace in the idea of life beyond the grave. He\u00a0wrote prolifically on the subject, publishing three books, \u2018 The New Revelation\u2019 (1918), \u2018 The Vital Message\u2019 (1919), and \u2018 The Wanderings of a Spiritualist\u2019 (1921), with Hodder & Stoughton.", "It was around this time, in the early 1920s, that Conan Doyle began researching fairies and came across photographs taken in 1917 using a \u2018Midg\u2019 camera belonging to a family in Cottingley, rural Yorkshire, now on display at the National Science and Media Museum . The photographs, which seemed\u00a0not having been tampered with, appeared to show several small fairies dancing under the careful watch of two young girls, Elsie Wright and her cousin Frances Griffiths. The technical and photographic skills used by the teenage Elsie Wright to produce these photographs, which were particularly unusual for a woman of this time, have often been overlooked.", "A second phase of fairy photographs were taken between 1918 and 1920, using a Kodak \u2018Cameo\u2019 photographic camera (shown left and now on display in the Kodak Gallery at the National Science and Media Museum ), provided by\u00a0Edward Gardner, a leading member of the\u00a0Theosophical Society in Bradford, where the original fairy photographs from 1917 had first been made public in 1919.", "Conan Doyle championed the photographs and their female subjects, eventually publishing them in his 1922 illustrated book The Coming of the Fairies , a first edition of which is held at the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester.", "For this contentious publication, Conan Doyle was widely ridiculed by the public, press, and priesthood. The publication was representative of the genres of spiritualism and the occult which flourished in the immediate post-war years as individuals, families, and nations attempted to make sense of the first war conducted on a truly industrial scale and the resulting deaths in their millions, from war as well as influenza.", "", "The final and most recent item related to Conan Doyle in the SMG Collection is Sherlock Holmes\u2019 dressing gown, as used by the British actor Jeremy Brett in his portrayal of the consulting detective in various Granada Television productions between 1984 and 1994. \u00a0Brett\u2019s portrayal of Sherlock Holmes is\u00a0widely regarded as one of the best if not the best Sherlock Holmes. \u00a0Alongside the actor\u2019s striking similarity to the Sidney Paget illustrations of Holmes (shown above) accompanying Conan Doyle\u2019s\u00a0original editions, Brett left \u2018an\u00a0indelible legacy on the character\u2019 of Sherlock Holmes with the \u00a0production in which he starred considered the single best adaptation of Conan Doyle\u2019s works.", "Nearly a century after Conan Doyle first committed Sherlock Holmes to print and over fifty years after Conan Doyle\u2019s death, the unique character and mannerisms of the consulting detective, along with his iconic deerstalker hat and dressing gown live on in print, on stage and screen, and beyond in popular culture.", "The three items above show the diversity of the SMG Collection. Dating from opposite ends of the twentieth century, \u2018A Canine Sherlock Holmes\u2019 and Sherlock Holmes\u2019 dressing gown highlight\u00a0the enduring popularity of Conan Doyle\u2019s character. Meanwhile, the more personal \u2018 The Coming of the Fairies\u2019 (1922) as well as artefacts relating to the photographs on display at the National Science and Media Museum reveal the deeply personal and tragic impact of the Great War on the life, writings, and beliefs of Conan Doyle himself."]},

Innovations by American scientists receive support at an earlier stage from American government measures than their British counterparts, which enables the US industry to take lower risks when delivering a novel technology to a market. But a note of warning and wise advice based on hard experience was given by Lord Waldegrave, who commented that put scientists and politicians too close together nearly always ends in catastrophe. Lord Sainsbury pointed out that offering to contribute to solving the problems that bedevil the Treasury is a better approach to the extraction of resources than demanding support.", "Lord Sainsbury questioned the assumption that public knowledge of science would lead to the public boosting its appetite for science. However, Sir Walter Bodmer pointed out that his committee never believed that widespread knowledge of science would equal public understanding of it, but was rather a prerequisite. This distinction had got lost subsequently. Regulation also has a role, with Sir John Ashworth pointing out the role of research-supported standards and regulation was one way to ensure the best quality in industry.", "The speakers vigorously agreed that it was in the interest of British industry to have strong government funded research institutes in a landmark meeting that distilled some of the basic truths to emerge from science policy over the past few decades.", "A number of tweets from the night have been storified and a transcript of the entire meeting will be mounted in a blog to follow soon."]},

His passing marks the end of an era in modern genetics.\u2019", "The American genome pioneer and synthetic biologist, Craig Venter of the J.

He twice changed the direction of the scientific world, first with the sequencing of insulin, proving that proteins were linear strings of amino acids and second with his then new method of sequencing DNA, which led to the field of genomics. His contributions will always be remembered.\u2019", "Most sequencing performed for the past decades is a direct extension of the methods that were pioneered by Fred Sanger. He unveiled\u00a0his first partial DNA sequence in May 1975\u00a0and went on to deliver the first complete determination of the sequence of a DNA molecule: the 5375 \u2018letters\u2019 in the genome of a bacterial virus called phi-X174.", "The DNA reading method that Sanger developed in Cambridge with Alan Coulson required the manufacture of lots of copies of the DNA molecule using an enzyme called DNA polymerase. For the polymerase to replicate DNA it needs DNA building blocks \u2013 molecules called nucleotides \u2013 which correspond to the four \u2018letters\u2019 of the genetic alphabet.", "The enzyme reads from each end of the original molecule to make new copies. For sequencing, Sanger added another ingredient: molecules called \u2018terminator nucleotides\u2019, each radioactively-labelled,\u00a0which are so named because they stop the polymerase when they are incorporated in the growing copy. As a consequence, the enzyme incorporates a terminator in the growing DNA chain, halting the process and marking the end of the growing chain with a radioactive molecule as a full stop.", "Because this interruption occurs at any stage of the process of copying vast numbers of DNA molecules in the test tube, a mixture is produced of DNA fragments of varying lengths, each finishing with a radioactively-marked C, G, A or T, depending on which base had been labelled.", "An electric field was used to drive these fragments through a gel to separate the DNA molecules according to their size and reveal the sequence: the largest pieces of DNA take more time to migrate through the gel. Because the radioactive label on all four terminators produces the same black mark on an X ray film, Sanger had to carry out four individual experiments, one for each different letter of the code, on four adjacent tracks on the same gel. When the genetic fragments separate, one track shows the DNA fragments that end with a C, one those that end with a\u00a0G and so on.", "Then Sanger and his colleagues studied the film, starting with the first band from the four letter tracks, moving to where the next closest band appeared. In this way, they could read the digital recipe of life. If the first, smallest, piece of DNA was in the C track, for example, then C was the first letter. If the next black mark was in the A track, then an A followed.", "Sanger\u00a0sequenced the 17,000 or so letters of DNA in the human mitochondrion, the energy factory found in our cells. This feat can be regarded the first human genome project. He won the Nobel prize for this work in 1980 but it was far from his first major award.", "He had been given his first Nobel prize in 1958, for his research on the structure of proteins, when he worked out the order of the 50 or so amino acids that make up the insulin molecule.

However, to get the bounce just right, the Lancaster bombers needed to approach the dams flying just 20m above the water while traveling at\u00a0230mph (more\u00a0on how this was done can be read here ).", "At exactly 389 metres from the dam wall \u2013 calculated by triangulating with the dam\u2019s towers \u2013 the bombs were released. Wallis calculated that backspin would stabilise the bombs in \u2018flight\u2019, help create the bounce and forced the bomb to cling to the face of the dam once it sank.", "Even with practice runs, it took many attempts to bounce the bombs correctly, and trials with live ammunition were only conducted three days before the raids . To this day, the skill and bravery of the 617 squadron (113 men in total), who flew low over enemy territory under the cover of darkness, remains breathtaking.", "After the war, Wallis continued his work on aircraft design (before WWII he was a pioneer of\u00a0geodetic design, used to build the largest airship of its time, the R100), designing\u00a0\u201cswing wing\u201d aircraft suited to hypersonic flight.", "Our Senior Keeper, Andrew Nahum, was interviewed about Barnes Wallis, his bouncing bomb and other work in 2013.

During the development process I\u2019d often show my team of Explainers the draft plans to see if they had any ideas or feedback based on their experience of working within the Garden gallery and it was really useful to get their input.", "Early on in the process we all agreed that it was important to include a Parents\u2019 Zone within the app. We wanted to provide some information for parents about how they could use the app to encourage the development of key scientific skills. In our interactive galleries we encourage learning through play and open questioning. For that reason, the Parents\u2019 Zone includes hints and tips about open questions that parents can ask their children whilst they play the app or later on during real bath time.", "After months of development we are all so pleased with the final Splash! app .

In front of a packed IMAX theatre at the Science Museum, Ellen took us through some of the extraordinary advances in science, technology and engineering resulting from exploration of space, and the challenges even now being worked on by scientists across the world driven by NASA\u2019s journey to Mars .", "One of the great unknowns for us here on Earth is whether we\u2019re alone in the universe \u2013 NASA\u2019s Journey to Mars mission is working to get closer to the answer. Why Mars? The obvious answer would be that it is our planetary neighbour but what makes it an exciting prospect in the search for life beyond earth \u2013 is water. Mars is marked all over with signs that water once persisted on the surface \u2013 the ragged surface on the red planet could be compared to some of the great geological masterpieces shaped by bodies of water over millennia here on Earth \u2013 and then in 2008 the Phoenix lander took a sample of ice.", "How do we begin such a search? What next steps do we need to take?", "Ellen began by highlighting the importance of international co-operation in order to achieve this grand goal of going to Mars. She outlined tremendous work already achieved through combined efforts \u2013 particularly noting the extraordinary Philae landing this month as well as the ongoing work through the International Space Station , saying that in her view such a collaboration is worthy of a Nobel Prize. Although they are extraordinary, exploration by rovers and landers is very slow and limited \u2013 having scientists on Mars would dramatically change the scope of exploration and the timescale of discoveries.", "We heard of the science, engineering and technology challenges that NASA has mapped out and how they, along with international and commercial partners, are going about finding answers. Getting people safely landed on Mars (and back again!) is not possible, yet \u2013 but Ellen said she expects it to happen in the 2030s. To get there, the challenges range from how to safely land a heavy craft in a thin and changing atmosphere, and how to keep Mars clean from contamination by microorganisms from earth, to ensuring that astronauts not only survive the eight month journey and landing but are healthy and able to work once they arrive \u2013 for instance combatting the muscle wasting and bone density loss that usually occurs in microgravity.", "Another challenge is making the mission as efficient as possible \u2013 mass affects everything. NASA astronauts are already able to recycle 80% of the water they use, but as Ellen said \u2013 don\u2019t think about that for too long. Other challenges you might not think about straight away \u2013 such as making sure dust from Mars isn\u2019t brought into the spacecraft. But when you think about it, at zero gravity dust could cause havoc! But perhaps the dust could be put to good use \u2013 with the developments in 3D printers a next step being investigated as part of the \u2018in situ resource utilisation\u2019 research is how to use Martian rock to manufacture spare parts, rather than having to transport powder manufactured on Earth.", "In the post-lecture Q&A one of the questions was on the timescale of decisions on future missions and investments. This highlighted the disconnect between the short-term, politically driven timescales of public funding and the long-term nature of NASA projects \u2013 a challenge not unfamiliar to UK scientists.", "And of course in order to achieve NASA\u2019s mission to Mars, and meet the many other great challenges faced closer to home, we need young people with creativity and ambition to become the next generation scientists and engineers. Ellen was animated about importance of inspiring young people about science and certainly did her bit on Friday (I saw one little girl grinning ear to ear holding a shiny new NASA badge)!", "It is hard to do justice to the inspirational talk given by Dr Stofan in the awesome IMAX theatre at the Science Museum, so I recommend listening to the audio recording of the lecture itself ( here ) and you will have to imagine it is accompanied by wonderful images that are 17m tall and literally out of this world.", "A guest blog post from\u00a0Nancy Williams, CaSE"]},

That\u2019s not to say that the project isn\u2019t informed by our previous research involving brain activation \u2013 it certainly is; or that we can\u2019t say something about brain processes from what we measure \u2013 we can.", "A large body of previous research has demonstrated that the system in the brain we use for making movements is also activated when we observe other people moving. This so-called \u2018mirror neuron system\u2019 has far-reaching implications for how we think about the brain, the mind and mental health. Although for the most part the existence of a mirror neuron system in the brain is uncontroversial, there is vigorous debate in the scientific community about what role such a system might play in thought, emotion and sociality. Some of the more enthusiastic claims argue that mirror neurons are a unifying basis for all aspects of social life in humans. Others, more skeptically, suggest that mirror neurons are important, but are more closely linked to movement co-ordination. To date much of the research in humans has focused on what this system is used for and what behaviours and thoughts it helps produce. Importantly, this research has led us to focus on the inherent connection between our own body and the body of others.", "The research we have taking place in the science museum hopes to build on our understanding of the mirror neuron system. Specifically, we want to understand a little more about how this system is affected by how we focus our attention to ourselves and our own bodies. The four different tasks that visitors can take part in are split into two categories; those that look at how we attend to our own body and those that look at how we attend to the bodies of other\u2019s. The overall aim is to see if attention to one\u2019s own body is related to the mirror neuron system.", "However, each task is also really relevant in its own right. The types of experiments we are running are often conducted in psychology laboratories with only a very small number of people taking part, and those people tend to be students in their early 20s.

Systems in the brain associated with attention and the mirror neuron system have been linked to mental health issues. Specifically, too much attention to our body has been linked to anxiety. Non-typical activation of the mirror neuron system has been linked to difficulties in understanding other people\u2019s emotions.

This revelation, that sorting through waste was like a form of contemporary archaeology, inspired Joshua to invite the public to take part in the documentation process so that visitors also had the chance to experience the wonder of piecing together those narratives.", "The stories we found in the bins ranged from the very general (like what the favourite crisp brand amongst visiting schoolchildren was) to more Museum-specific (like which new galleries were under development and which events had taken place). Even the volume told us how busy the Museum had been on a given day. There were also very personal stories such as notes put into someone\u2019s lunchbox by their partner, a surprising number of medicines, and children\u2019s drawings of their day out. In a painfully frank teenage love note, the author proclaims that they are not worth the attention of their crush and recommends they should go out with someone else.

We\u2019ll never know).", "We don\u2019t often think about our rubbish, full stop, let alone consider it as a personal document of our lives. Archaeologists have long been aware of this when piecing together a picture of the lifestyles and living conditions of people\u2019s past, as have the paparazzi in finding out private information about celebrities and public figures. Looking at the landfill of the last few decades, I imagine, will tell a story of the rise of plastics and packaging, the dominance of certain supermarkets and brands, the affordability of electrical goods, our increasingly global markets and the enormous growth in waste generally. Hopefully, as with the Science Museum\u2019s bins, an examination of the more recent landfill should document a more positive change, that of recycling and our increased awareness of the value that materials still hold. The next step may be mining our municipal dumps to try to recover some of those precious materials that are now scarce in the natural world, such as the rare earth metals that are so important in the manufacture of electronic goods.", "And what will become of all the rubbish and materials on display in The Rubbish Collection ? Well, the materials, like the paper reels, plastic pellets, metals, and fertilizer, will be returned to the companies that lent them to us, to continue on their recycling journey to become new products.\u00a0 Electrical goods will be sent to specialist recycling companies to separate any reusable parts and recycle what cannot be salvaged.

Before this, individual sounds had been recorded onto discs or spools of steel wire which meant that it was impossible for them to be edited together in advance.", "Dick Mills gave us an animated description of the rather frantic work of playing multiple discs at the same time to provide sound effects for live radio broadcasts.

It is worth taking your time over this bit as the smoother the join is the smoother the sound of the loop will be. Although conversely, sometimes a rhythmic clunk at the end of each repetition can be just what a loop needs to give it shape. I recommend using a tiny piece of sellotape on the underside of the tape and trimming off any excess.", "Step Ten: Carefully place the loop back inside the tape, hooking it around the four white spools: both the larger central pair and the smaller two on each side.", "Step Eleven: Position the tape so that it hooks around all of the spools but is also in front of the cassette\u2019s metal mechanism.

Make sure that the tape is held behind these plastic teeth at the front and not trapped in them.", "Step Thirteen: Listen and enjoy!*", "* As many great experimental musicians from Philip Glass to Mark E. Smith will tell you, repetition can be fascinating. As I have said, this process produces random results which vary in quality so you may have to fiddle around until you find something that works for you.

Whether it was via natural means- Heliotherapy \u2013 or via artificial methods- Phototherapy \u2013 the medical profession held up light as a powerful and triumphant form of treatment.", "The curative potential of light and its discovery as a revolutionary \u201cnew\u201d treatment had its foundations in the pioneering work of 19 th century bacteriologists such as Arthur Downes, Thomas Blunt and Robert Koch . Their published works demonstrated the antibacterial properties of light, and as such opened up the field of light therapeutics as a scientifically justified and potentially ground-breaking area of medical treatment.", "The ability of light to destroy tuberculosis bacillus, and potentially aid in the treatment of illnesses such as lupus and pulmonary tuberculosis was a particularly exciting medical discovery, especially considering the prevalence of the disease within contemporary industrialised society, and its resistance to most forms of treatment.", "However, the increased medicalisation of light and its transfer from a handful of specifically located, sun drenched, natural sanatoriums ( heliotherapy ), to the automated and controlled arena of a hospital, relied heavily on the ability to artificially harness UV rays ( phototherapy ). This was achieved thanks to the pioneering work of Danish physician Neils Ryberg Finsen, who in 1894 developed his eponymous lamp for the treatment of tuberculosis of the skin ( lupus vulgaris ).", "Alongside the physical development of the apparatus, Finsen opened a Medical Light Institute in Copenhagen, which researched the impact of the therapy and the efficacy of light as a treatment in general. The institute was part funded by the Danish state; a symbol of the importance placed upon this new therapy and how readily it was accepted as a progressive new treatment with significant medical potential.", "Finsen\u2019s lamp used telescopic arms to mimic the beneficial effects of the sun and focus the remedial properties of UV light onto an infected area of skin. His process achieved remarkable results and earned him worldwide notoriety, including the support and patronage of fellow Dane, Queen Alexandra, wife of Edward VII, whilst she was Princess of Wales. Alexandra presented a lamp to the London Hospital in 1900, and thus helped establish a light therapy department within the UK. This lamp is now part of the Science Museum\u2019s collection. Finsen\u2019s work was further recognised in 1903, when he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine .", "Finsen\u2019s ground-breaking work, and the positive results it achieved in treating tuberculosis of the skin, did much to sow the seeds for light therapies acceptance within both medical and popular society, and solidify its reception as a regenerative medical cure. The zenith of light therapies popularity came in the 1920\u2019s/30\u2019s, when numerous tanning apparatus\u2019 were sold to the domestic market in a heavily glamorized manner.", "Upon being awarded his Nobel Prize, it was commented that Finsen deserved the \u201ceternal gratitude of suffering humanity\u201d, yet his lamp was gradually phased out upon the discovery of antibiotics. Although light therapy is still used today, notably for the treatment of Seasonal Affective Disorder, the negative impact of excess UV light on skin creates a challenging tension with its notion as a universally healing force.

It was apparent from the beginning that the method was applicable to anything that could be induced to crystallise, even the most complex molecules of chemistry and biology.

The early models simply depict the contours of these maps and give the overall form of the protein molecule. Coming some years after X-rays had unveiled the elegant double-helix of DNA, their crude irregularity was at first a disappointment: \u201chideous and visceral\u201d wrote Perutz.", "But the resolving power of X-rays soon improved and those early crystallographers had to swap plastic and plasticene for intricate assemblies of rods, each representing a bond between two atoms, that were put together with loving attention to detail.

The answer is the Parkesine Company Ltd, opened in Hackney Wick in 1866 to commercialise Parkesine.", "During the 19 th century, desirable materials such as ivory, ebony and tortoiseshell became increasingly rare and expensive.

Parkesine is a combination of organic matter \u2013 cotton fibre \u2013 mixed with chemical nitrates, vegetable oils, camphor and alcohol.\u00a0 When nitrates get hot they have a tendency to explode, so using Parkesine for anything that creates friction is asking for trouble.", "Lucky, the Science Museum also looks after the notebooks of Alexander Parkes in our Archives at Wroughton.

Formica literally stands for \u2018for mica\u2019, as it was developed as a synthetic plastic substitute for expensive mineral mica. It was made by binding layers of cloth or paper together with a phenolic resin (originally Bakelite).

Here are seven preliminary insights to emerge from his work:", "What is the optimum amount of sleep?", "The optimal amount of sleep seems to be between 7-8 hours. \u2018I don\u2019t think people will be surprised by the main finding which is that your cognition is absolutely at its best with between seven and eight hours of sleep,\u2019 he said. \u201cThat is about right. There is something in that old saying about eight hours of sleep being the right amount.\u2019", "I asked the jet-lagged professor, what effect does sleep deprivation have?", "\u2018A large number of people (several thousand), more than you think, reported getting between four and five hours of sleep,\u2019 said Prof Owen. The team compared these people with those who claimed to get 8 hours and the 4-hour sleepers were worse \u2018on every single cognitive test\u2019 \u2013 when it came to cognitive skills, they were \u2018significantly poorer.\u2019", "The difference in performance between people who slept four hours and those who slept the optimal amount is 0.34 standard deviations, or equivalent to about 5 IQ points being \u2018knocked off\u2019, he said. This is akin to \u2018having a couple of drinks\u2019. So far, sleep seems to affect performance on all tests equally, so a poor night\u2019s sleep translates into a poor performance.", "Do we understand the link between sleep deprivation and poor performance?", "In a recent study on 27 sleeping people, Prof Owen and his colleagues used a method called EEG to study electrical activity in the brain and revealed a link to what are called spindles, bursts of activity in a deep structure called the thalamus,\u00a0 which plays a central role in memory, attention, perception, awareness, thought, language, and consciousness.", "Earlier studies have linked spindles with IQ. \u201cIn fact, spindles are the only biological marker of intelligence\u2019, he said, explaining how he finds it remarkable that they can be used to predict how well you do, when wide awake, on a decision-making task.", "The new work by his lab connects these\u00a0\u2018squiggles\u2019 of electrical activity during light sleep with reasoning\u00a0abilities. \u201cWe have identified the brain circuits \u2013 those linked with higher cognitive functions\u00a0that were time-locked to spindles that are correlated to cognitive abilities,\u201d he said. So, it seems sleep deprivation may interfere with spindles, \u2018damaging our reasoning ability.\u201d", "Can you have too much sleep?", "Yes. Prof Owen\u2019s huge survey reveals that too much sleep also seems to be associated with poorer cognitive performance. People who got more than 8.8 hours of sleep also tended to do worse at the tests. \u2018Too much sleep can also be bad for you.\u2019 However, the effects were not as large as those who were sleep deprived.", "Is age a factor in how much you need?", "Though early days, the 7-8 hour recommended amount of sleep remains the same, even though the amount of sleep changes over a normal lifespan. \u2018It is still the people who get seven to eight hours who do the best,\u2019 he said.", "Has your sleep study shed light on other aspects of intelligence?", "Some more general insights into cognition have emerged. Many scientists believe that if you learn a second language, particularly as a child, it will \u2018somehow make you smarter,\u2019 he said. Data on 5000 or so people who could speak two languages suggested they are no different from those who only speak one. \u2018That\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t advantages to speaking two languages, but it doesn\u2019t make you smarter.\u2019", "What is sleep?", "Sleep marks a shift in consciousness, explains Prof Owen. \u2018When you go to sleep at night, there are some parts of your brain that continue to process information around you, just as if you are awake, and other parts of your brain which shut down and don\u2019t process that at all \u2013 it is a change of the level of your consciouness.\u2019", "Sleep is as vital for life as food or water. Lab rats deprived of sleep die within a month, and too little affects your immune system and appetite, is linked to heart disease, obesity, and diabetes. Increasingly, a lack of sleep is implicated in mental health problems including bipolar disorder, depression and schizophrenia, even Alzheimer\u2019s", "During the event, we also discussed the world\u2019s largest intelligence test and the subject of his book,\u00a0 research that Prof Owen began in Cambridge two decades ago, notably at the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, using brain scans to investigate patients who are trapped in the grey zone between life and death.", "Because of the rise in recent decades of resuscitation and emergency medicine, which can save the lives of severely-brain damaged patients, tens of thousands of people around the world now inhabit the grey zone.", "", "A recording of the event can be heard here"]},

We gathered in the smart six-storey brownstone home of author Andrew Solomon, where the CSHL archivist Mila Pollock showed us the first editions of the book, along with extracts that appeared in The Atlantic. There was an introduction to The Double Helix by the writer Jonathan Weiner and a tribute from Nobel prizewinning neuroscientist Eric Kandel, who praised Watson\u2019s early textbook The Molecular Biology of the Gene as being the \u2018best of its kind\u2019 in its day.", "Watson told the throng that it was \u2018very easy\u2019 and \u2018fun\u2019 to write the 30 urgent chapters of The Double Helix, each taking him around a week, and its success was in part down to describing \u2018one of the great moments in science.\u2019", "He wrote the book after he shared the Nobel Prize in 1962, with Crick and Maurice Wilkins of King\u2019s College London (older than Watson, both died in 2004).

Concerns about libel only calmed when Bragg agreed to do the foreword, giving it credence. Even though Crick had complained \u2018Who could possibly want to read stuff like this?\u2019, the book was an immediate bestseller, shifting more than a million copies.", "Crick would come to accept that Watson had written something special, which showed the complex way theories become \u2018fact\u2019, even if it did begin with: \u2018I have never seen Francis Crick in a modest mood.\u2019 (Watson told the 50th celebration that he had even toyed with calling his book Base Pairs \u2018as a joke to annoy Francis\u2019).", "In retaliation, Crick quipped that he had thought of writing his own account, provisionally entitled \u2018The Loose Screw\u2019 and starting out with: \u2018Jim was always clumsy with his hands. One had only to see him peel an orange.\u2019", "When I talked to Wilkins in 2003, he acknowledged that The Double Helix was pioneering for the vivid insight it gave into the personalities and process of science. He bore no malice towards Watson and Crick, whom he had called \u2018a couple of old rogues\u2019. But he did have one regret.", "Wilkins had declined when they had had invited him to co-author the Nature letter that unveiled the double helix in April 1953. He reasoned that he had not helped them build their now famous model of DNA (you can see a copy in the Science Museum, which contains pieces of the original) but he subsequently realised that co-authorship would have emphasised the crucial cooperation between Crick and Watson in Cambridge with the team at King\u2019s.", "The controversy lives on Today The Double Helix remains controversial for Watson\u2019s musings on the opposite sex (\u2018The thought could not be avoided that the best home for a feminist was in another person\u2019s lab\u2019\u2026. \u2018the presence of popsies does not inevitably lead to a scientific future.\u2019) and for his portrayal of \u2018Rosy\u2019, the King\u2019s College chemist whose work, unknown to her, was revealed to Watson and Crick by Wilkins: (note that the nickname \u2018Rosy\u2019 was not dreamt up by Watson but by her colleagues at King\u2019s).", "Watson\u2019s book provides a vivid glimpse of the antediluvian attitudes of the day: \u2018She was not unattractive and might have been quite stunning had she taken even a mild interest in clothes. This she did not\u2019 writes Watson in one passage. And in another: \u2018I wondered how she would look if she took off her glasses and did something novel with her hair.\u2019", "Watson and Crick were swept along in their efforts to crack biology\u2019s deepest mystery by a creative convergence of their work in Cambridge with that in London, and of research in two fields of science: chemistry, notably by playing with toy-like models of the shape of molecules, and physics, which furnished a way to reveal the structure of complex molecules with X rays, a technique that Bragg had pioneered four decades earlier.", "There were many ingredients of success: the three laureates had been inspired by What Is Life? The Physical Aspect of the Living Cell, a 1944 book by physicist Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger. Watson and Crick were spurred on by their rivalry with Pauling. The molecular structures for their models were corrected one Thursday by quantum chemist Jerry Donohue, who shared an office with them. (That insight provided the \u2018key,\u2019 Watson told me, for building one turn of the double helix the following Saturday on a table in the middle of their office.) And they had access to the X-ray data from King\u2019s.", "There Wilkins had been on to the idea of helices since 1951 but his boss John Randall had soured Wilkins\u2019s relationship with Franklin (Randall had implied in a letter to her that DNA would be her project alone), and she was both uninterested in building models and dismissive of the idea of a helix. As Watson recalled, \u2018She became increasingly annoyed with my recurring references to helical structures.\u2019", "Her data, which she did not directly share, would prove vital, as he put it (Watson recalled her photograph 51 was a revelation, because it \u201cwas so perfect\u201d), and she provided insights into the relationship between the bases (the chemical \u2018letters\u2019 of the code) and the supporting structure of phosphate groups. Initially, late in 1951, they got the structure inside out (\u2018pure crap\u2019, as Watson trenchantly put it to me) and \u2018Rosy had hit it right in wanting the bases in the centre and the backbone outside\u2019. Even so, persiflage proved irresistible to Watson: \u2018her past uncompromising statements on this matter thus reflected first rate science, not the outpourings of a misguided feminist\u2019.", "But the relatively recent vogue for crediting Franklin with the most important part of the discovery has gone too far, Crick remarked the year before he died. Franklin, who was close to Crick, especially during her last illness, had never complained that she deserved more credit. But, of course, she never realised the extent to which the Cambridge duo had relied on her data.", "Despite his attitude towards Franklin, Watson does not portray her as a passive victim: Franklin \u2018got positively aggressive\u2019 \u2026 \u2018displayed increasing irritation\u2019\u2026. and \u2019fierce annoyance\u2019 Indeed, Wilkins found that she could be terrifying. But when they eventually cracked the structure in 1953, Watson reports how she \u2018accepted the fact that the structure was too pretty not to be true\u2019. By the start of that year she too had come around to the idea of helices, after being, at best, unconvinced, at worst, hostile to the idea.", "Franklin died of cancer in 1958 but if she had been alive when the Nobel committee had deliberated about the prize, which can only go to a maximum of three people, Watson said \u2018it would have produced an \u2018awkward if not insolvable dilemma.\u2019", "The implications of the double helix were profound. Watson was nervous about discussing them and it was Crick who came up with the payoff of their letter to the journal Nature : \u2019It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material.\u2019 By splitting the base pairs of the double helix apart, and using each DNA strand as a template for building a new strand, DNA could replicate itself, along with its genes.", "Thus, by revealing the structure they had shown how biological information is transmitted down the generations. Watson recounted his initial reaction when he saw the double helix that fateful Saturday: \u2018I\u2019m going to be famous.\u2019 He felt a Nobel prize would inevitably follow, though it would take a year for another reference to the double helix to appear in Nature and nine years in all for the prize to eventually materialise.", "Beyond the Double Helix Watson did not rest on his laurels. He decided to leave Cambridge, despite its huge influence on biology at that time. \u201cFrancis being such a dominant person, I had to. My own career demanded I separate from Francis. \u2018", "Watson moved to Harvard University where his laboratory made many early contributions to molecular biology including, along with a group led by Sydney Brenner, the discovery of messenger RNA that mediates the transfer of genetic information from DNA to the cell.", "Watson would become an intellectual impresario, turning Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on the East Coast of America into one of the world\u2019s principal centres of biology, focusing on cancer genetics, where around 1150 people now work. He led the effort to read the entire human genetic code, which he began to consider in 1966, and on the way, he has courted much controversy, for instance making provocative comments on intelligence (always a fraught issue), declaring that the research on mice of Judah Folkman at Harvard Medical School would cure cancer within two years, or advocating genetic enhancement: \u2018All parents want the best for their kids\u2019.", "The double helix has stood the test of time. That is not the case for a surprising amount of research. In 2005, John Ioannidis, Professor at Stanford University, stunned his peers with a study bluntly entitled Why Most Published Research Findings Are False. A decade later, it was reported that more than half of psychology studies could not be reproduced and, last year, Ioannidis concluded that cognitive neuroscience was in an even worse state than psychology. Efforts to reproduce the findings of many papers have proved problematic .", "That is why, half a century on, The Double Helix remains required reading. If it has revealed anything about the process of research, it is that the motor that drives many scientists on is much more than simply a cold-eyed, logical quest to sate their curiosity with the truth.

Fabric dyes were derived from plants and insects and expensive to make. Colourful wardrobes were a significant symbol of wealth; in particular purples were the often used in the garments of popes and monarchs.", "In 1853 the young chemist William Perkin entered the Royal College of Chemistry , now part of Imperial College London, as a student supervised by August Wilhelm Hofmann . A year later, at only sixteen years old, Perkin assembled a laboratory at his home on Cable Street in east London where he started independent research. Perkin sometimes collaborated with Arthur H. Church , a talented painter who was interested in the chemistry of paint.", "By 1856 Perkin had become Hofmann\u2019s assistant and Hoffmann challenged him to synthesize quinine , an expensive natural substance much in demand for the treatment of malaria. Perkin started by reacting a salt of allyltoluidine with potassium dichromate.", "The experiment failed.

Perkin filed a patent for this process (patent no. 1984 of August 1856).", "Perkin\u2019s mauveine quickly became popular after he borrowed money from his father to establish a factory, invented a way for the dye to be used on cotton as well as silk and gave advice to the dyeing industry on how this new synthetic dye worked.", "Public demand increase when Queen Victoria and Empress Eug\u00e9nie, wife of Napoleon III were seen in the colour.\u00a0The Science Museum holds this incredible example of this fashion from the 1860s, and a sample of mauveine dyed fabric supplied to Queen Victoria.", "After the discovery of mauveine, many new aniline dyes appeared (some discovered by Perkin himself), and factories producing them were constructed across Europe. In the pursuit of more and more colours German and British dye manufacturers pushed at the boundaries of chemical knowledge and the experimental work of the dye industry is closely linked to developments in medicine and pharmaceuticals.", "Perkin\u2019s synthetic colourant was a gateway, leading to the emergency of the synthetic dye industry . This is a celebrated historical story that focuses on firsts, in an industry that produced a rainbow of fantastic colours ; mauve has become famous because it was the first synthetic dye.

Even the most famous of natural philosophers Galileo and Newton fought for the recognition of being the first to discover and invent. The race to discover the structure of DNA was so fiercely run because being the first to declare the structure would insure a place in history.

Historians of science work hard to discover these hidden scientists and technicians.", "This obsession with premiership extends to museums and their objects.", "The Science Museum collection holds some of the first samples of mauve produced by Perkin. Chemical analysis on our dyes and textile samples show that our \u2018original mauveine\u2019 was most likely not prepared in 1856 as it\u2019s labelled, but is from a 1906 batch made to celebrate the jubilee of Perkin\u2019s accidental discovery.", "Does this diminish the object\u2019s importance? Perhaps it adds another layer to the history? The shawls in our collection were dye with Perkin\u2019s original 1856 mauveine formula and exhibited at the International Exhibition of 1862.

Though only an edited version of his laborious original effort remains in the film, it speaks volumes about Redmayne\u2019s attention to detail that he was prepared to go so far.", "Hawking was so impressed with the film, said Redmayne, that he responded with a generous gift \u2014 allowing the filmmakers to swap the synthetic voice they had to create and replace it with his own, trademarked computerized version.", "Trying to balance his science with his personal story presented some of the same challenges for the James Marsh, director of The Theory of Everything, as it did for curators three years ago, when the Science Museum put on an exhibition to celebrate Hawking\u2019s 70th birthday .", "While Stephen Hawking might be a celebrity, he is first and foremost a scientist and not only that but a theoretical physicist, one who deals with ideas rather than something tangible like technology. Redmayne admits that it was daunting getting the right balance between science and entertainment.", "Still, the film shows how Hawking first captured the attention of his peers in the late 1960s, working with Roger Penrose (played by Christian McKay) on how the laws of physics \u2013 notably Einstein\u2019s law of gravity \u2013 sometimes break down, resulting in something called a spacetime singularity . If general relativity was correct, they showed, then such singularities must occur inside black holes \u2013 and, most probably, at the start of the universe", "This idea implies that singularities mark the beginning and end of space and time, which was created during the Big Bang and breaks down within black holes, where it is necessary to incorporate quantum theory \u2013 the theory of the very small \u2013 in order to understand what is really going on.", "The film makes much of how Hawking was determined to find \u201ca simple eloquent explanation\u201d for the universe. One of Hawking\u2019s long-standing goals has been to blend the theory of the very big (general relativity) with the very small (quantum theory) to produce an overarching theory known as quantum gravity.", "As the film points out \u2013 with the help of its consultant, Jerome Gauntlett, former\u00a0PhD student in Stephen\u2019s group, who is now Head of the Theoretical Physics Group at Imperial College London \u2013 \u00a0Hawking moved on to a more radical formulation which incorporates some aspects of quantum theory, the no boundary idea, which says that the entire history of the universe, all of space and time, forms a kind of four-dimensional sphere. Thus speculation about the beginning or end of the universe is as meaningless as talking about the beginning or end of a sphere.", "One strange consequence of quantum theory is that empty space isn\u2019t empty at all: pairs of particles are constantly popping into and out of existence. If they appear on the event horizon \u2013 the point of no return from the gravity well of a black hole \u2013 they may find themselves on different sides, with one sucked in, and the other zooming free as \u201cHawking radiation.\u201d", "There\u2019s a scene in the film showing when Hawking gets a sweater trapped halfway over his head and has an insight that leads to this discovery. \u201cHawking radiation is widely considered to be the single most important insight into quantum gravity that has been discovered so far,\u201d says Gauntlett, who also helped to bring Redmayne up to speed with Hawking\u2019s science.", "The director James Marsh told me that he sees the movie as a human story first and foremost but he does hope, as does Gauntlett, that it will encourage those who are intrigued by the science to find out more. \u201cTo be honest, dramatic film is not the best place to explore theoretical physics\u201d Marsh explained. \u201cThe idea was to make the science universally available and that meant simple. Better that than address a snobbish or elitist audience. Better that a 14 year old boy or girl watches the film and is intrigued to find out more.\u201d", "One way he used to lay out scientific thinking in lay terms was to allow the character of Jane to do some explaining, rather that Stephen himself. But, of course, Hawking himself has provided the most stellar example of how to bridge the gulf between the public and cosmologists with A Brief History of Time, which has sold more than 10 million copies worldwide.

Today many see the arts and sciences as being poles of a singular culture. But others believe that art, technology and science are starting to merge to create a new art movement they call \u2018art-sci\u2019.", "That is the view of Arthur Miller of University College London, who has popularised this idea in his book, Colliding Worlds: How Cutting-Edge Science is Redefining Contemporary Art , where he explores the quirky and fantastic results of this symbiosis at CERN, MIT Media Lab, Ars Electronica and more.", "With Miller, the sound/video performance artist Paul Prudence , an internationally known audio-visual performer, and media artist Mike Phillips , Professor of Interdisciplinary Arts at Plymouth University, I discussed how the relationship between art and science has evolved, and where it is heading, at\u00a0The Times Cheltenham Science Festival.", "There is a long history of cross-fertilisation between science and art. The Science Museum contains many examples of how artists have found their muse in science, from the way Leonardo da Vinci used graphical techniques to show how the parts \u2013 \u2018elementi\u2019 \u2013 of machines\u00a0 worked together, to the influence of photographic pioneer \u00c9tienne Jules Marey on the Italian Futurist movement.", "Early scientific photographs expanded our field of vision during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, such as Henri Becquerel\u2019s images that demonstrated the radioactivity of uranium salts.", "The Museum has inspired artists, such as Henry Moore , and worked with them too , from David Hockney to\u00a0Thomas Heatherwick\u00a0and Zaha Hadid .", "Miller has studied the origins of creativity for decades and, for example, explored how Einstein and Picasso responded to the avant-garde, whose principal problem was to redefine classical intuitive notions of space and time. He argues that the annus mirabilis of Einstein and Picasso were connected:", "\u201cEinstein discovered relativity in 1905 because he thought like an artist. Two years later Picasso created his breakthrough painting les Demoiselles d\u2019Avignon because he thought like a scientist.\u201d", "Miller believes that art-sci is the new avant-garde, producing works that \u2018differ radically from anything that has gone before\u2019. These range from a gigantic glass-and-chrome chandelier-like sculpture of the Big Bang, to how, to find new inspiration, nanobiologist James Gimzewski worked with an artist, to more provocative\u00a0\u201cbio-art,\u201d which uses DNA and living tissue as raw material and features creations such as a rabbit implanted with the fluorescent gene of a jellyfish, and the artist who, after a transfusion of horse blood, claimed to have \u201cthe emotionalism of an herbivore.\u201d", "One issue of debate was whether this meeting of artists and scientists is more collision than collaboration. During questions, Prof Mark Lythgoe, Chair of The Times Cheltenham Science Festival, reminded the audience of a remark made by Lewis Wolpert, in The Unnatural Nature of Science, that art cannot contribute to science. Though Lythgoe believes this to be wrong, he admitted that evidence to the contrary was hard to find.", "But, countered Miller, \u2018the interplay is in fact blossoming\u2019 and the 21 st century has seen a merging of art, science and technology. Although he had been aware of this trend for some time, Miller first witnessed it in the flesh in 2002, when he saw an\u00a0exhibition\u00a0at the W h itney in New York of computer code as art. \u2018Clearly something was going beyond interplay.\u2019 The rise of big data, and data visualisation, is just one example of how the horizons of this work are expanding, he said, citing the work of Aaron Koblin who has turned flight data into images of gossamer networks .", "As we continue to move beyond traditional \u2018flat art\u2019 such as painting, there are artists who now study mathematics, physics and coding, and he added that, through the rise of the smartphone, human experience is increasingly being moderated by machines. Indeed, one day, \u2018we will be the machines\u2019.", "Paul Prudence, who blogs about his work, went on to tell the audience how, in the chilly vault of a deconsecrated church, he carried out an alchemical blending of geometrical images and sound to conjure up patterns that whirl and morph into black holes, and more, against a booming soundtrack.", "Prudence described how he repurposes simulations from the scientific community \u2013 such as models of bubble formation \u2013 to turn them into art. He gave the Cheltenham audience a glimpse of this new aesthetic, as geometric forms clicked and span to an eerie soundtrack.", "As for where this explosion of data is taking us, Prudence said he\u00a0can see the rise of increasingly bespoke art, shaped to the senses of the observer by algorithms, and the rise of holographic immersive art so that it is easier than ever to manipulate 3D space: \u2018Just imagine the possibilities for voxel sculpting\u2019.", "Phillips continues efforts to use science to explore invisible worlds and has used nanotechnology \u2013 such as Atom Force Microscopy\u00a0\u2013\u00a0to inspire his art . At the festival, he showed a \u201ctranscalar zoom from the outer edges of the known universe to a nano level\u201d, ranging from the cosmically distant to the microscopically small, seasoned with various cultural references, from Fireball XL5 to the Hollywood movie, The Man with the X-Ray Eyes.", "He gave a brief overview of other works include \u2018Murmuration\u2019, in which the audience is able to fly through an magnetic resonance imaging scan of his own body, along with a study of a mote of dust taken from his own eye. Last week, at Tate Modern, Phillips unveiled his latest work, This is Where we Are .", "One problem confronting this movement, Phillips explained, is that language cannot easily describe many scientific concepts, notably those from quantum theory, such as entanglement. But when it comes to where art-sci is taking us, Phillips believes that, above all else, the relentless rise of artificial intelligence will be transformative.", "During questions, Prof Tom McLeish of Durham University, a particle physicist with a religious bent, cited the American literary critic George Steiner who once wrote, \u201cOnly art can go some way towards making accessible, towards waking into some measure of communicability, the sheer inhuman otherness of matter.\u201d", "In the light of the discussion, perhaps it is art-sci that is best placed to reveal the narrative structure of the cosmos."]},

Special relativity posits that the speed of light is always the same, irrespective of the motion of the person who measures it. Special relativity also implies that space and time are intertwined to a degree never previously imagined.", "Starting in 1907, Einstein began trying to broaden special relativity to include gravity. His first advance came when he was working in a patent office in Bern, Switzerland and an idea occurred to him:", "If a man falls freely, he would not feel his weight\u2026 This simple thought experiment\u2026 led me to the theory of gravity.", "He realised that there is a deep relationship between systems affected by gravity and those that are accelerating.", "Then in 1908, Einstein\u2019s former teacher Hermann Minkowski repackaged relativity in a neater mathematical form that dealt with space and time as an inseparable whole, called \u2018space-time\u2019. The next step was to find a new language to describe this four-dimensional landscape.", "Einstein turned for guidance to Marcel Grossmann , the same friend whose lecture notes he had cribbed years before as a student. \u2018Grossmann, you must help me, or else I\u2019ll go crazy\u2019 he wrote.", "Grossmann acted as Einstein\u2019s guide through the jungles of non-Euclidean geometry, where space is curved so that parallel lines do not exist and the three angles of a triangle do not add up to 180 degrees. Einstein needed a mathematical tool that would allow him to deal with this exotic geometry. In 1913, he and Grossmann published a paper in which they began this programme, using what is called tensor calculus.", "As Einstein struggled in Berlin in 1915 to complete the extension of relativity, he increasingly cut himself off from the outside world. Letters were far less likely to be answered than to be impaled on a large meat hook and later burnt. The work was most intense in mid to late November, when Einstein wrote to almost no one, aside from David Hilbert, the great German mathematician, whose work on gravity ran remarkably close to his own.", "In November, came Einstein\u2019s epiphany. He revealed to the world that he could now explain an astronomical puzzle \u2014 a variation in the orbit of Mercury around the Sun that had perplexed scientists since it was first reported in 1859.", "Success showed that, after eight years of groping for the truth about gravity, he had provided a new and profound glimpse of the workings of the universe. His latter-day colleague Abraham Pais has described this as possibly the strongest emotional experience of Einstein\u2019s life. It was certainly a rapturous one. Einstein reported having had heart palpitations and feeling as if something inside him had snapped. \u2018I was beside myself with ecstasy for days,\u2019 he told Paul Ehrenfest, the theoretical physicist.", "Einstein showed that gravity was not a force from one body acting on another, but a property of space-time itself. Massive objects such as black holes create distortions in the space-time around them, and these four-dimensional curves act as pathways for smaller objects to follow, rather as a ball bearing follows the line of least resistance over a hilly two-dimensional surface.", "His exertions left him exhausted. In December 1915 Einstein wrote to his old friend Michele Besso that he was \u2018satisfied but rather done in\u2019.", "", "By Dr Harry Cliff", "A century after its birth, general relativity is still science\u2019s ultimate tool for understanding the cosmos. It underpins our modern cosmological theories, allowing scientists to study the birth, evolution and ultimate fate of the universe. It describes the most extreme objects in nature, from the supermassive black holes that lurk at the centres of galaxies to violent collisions between neutron stars. Astronomers have even used general relativity\u2019s predictions of how massive bodies bend light rays to map clouds of invisible dark matter that thread vast clusters of galaxies.", "General relativity was so ahead of its time in 1915 that it took decades to explore many of its consequences. Physicists including Roger Penrose and Stephen Hawking only began to make progress in understanding black holes in the 1960s and 70s, and the prediction of general relativity that the rotation of the Earth should drag space and time along with it has still to be confirmed by observation.", "But the most highly anticipated test today of general relativity is the detection of gravitational waves , ripples in the fabric of space-time created by the acceleration of massive bodies. Observing these ripples would give astronomers a new window on the universe, allowing them to study exotic objects like black holes and to peer further back towards the Big Bang than is possible using light-based astronomy.", "The trouble is that gravitational waves are incredibly weak, and require huge and extremely sensitive instruments to detect. The $620 million Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) in the USA offers the best hope to observe them in the near future.", "LIGO\u2019s L-shaped observatories work by beaming lasers down two 4km arms at right angles to one another. If a gravitational wave passes by it will cause the two arms to shrink and expand by tiny but different amounts, about a 10,000 th of the width of a proton. This is then detected as a tiny shift in the arrival time of the laser light\u2019s peaks and troughs, creating what is known as an interference pattern.", "Although LIGO has not spotted any gravitational waves yet, it has recently been upgraded and should soon be able to detect ripples in space-time produced by collisions between neutron stars in distant galaxies up to around 650 million light-years from Earth. If gravitational waves are seen in the next few years, it will mark the beginning of an exciting new age of astronomy and of our understanding of Einstein\u2019s greatest contribution to science.", "", "By\u00a0Paul Franklin, co-funder of Double negative", "The plot of Interstellar , Christopher Nolan\u2019s sci-fi epic, spins around Gargantua a super-massive black hole, simulated in unprecedented detail for the film.

Over the last few decades black holes have become a regular feature of science fiction, but we\u2019ve become used to looking at fanciful and, frankly, inaccurate representations of them \u2013 we were determined to change that.", "For Chris Nolan it was essential to embed real science into the story and then see where it would take us. Relativity allowed us to explore the story possibilities offered by time dilation \u2013 through which clocks can tick at different rates for different characters depending on where they are in the universe \u2013 and the extraordinary power of Einstein\u2019s equations allowed us to visualise Gargantua, the super-massive black hole that features in the film, and in unprecedented detail.", "Gargantua was realised through a unique collaboration between Kip Thorne , The Feynman Professor of Theoretical Physics Emeritus at CalTech in Pasadena, California, and Double Negative\u2019s research and development team, headed up by Chief Scientist Oliver James. Kip is a leading expert on general relativity and the inspiration for Sir Michael Caine\u2019s character in the film.", "Together, Kip, Oliver and our R&D team developed a new suite of software tools to model one of general relativity\u2019s most famous predictions, that the path of a light beam can curve as it passes through gravitationally-warped space. The result was a super-accurate model of the \u201cgravitational lens\u201d around Gargantua which, through the simulation of trillions of light beams, created the stunning images seen in the film \u2013 when you see the \u201cwaterfall of fire\u201d in the accretion disc cascading around Gargantua you are looking directly at the visual results of Einstein\u2019s ground-breaking work.", "Interstellar also deals with the concept of travel through hypothetical tunnels in space-time connecting distant parts of the universe, also predicted by Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity.\u00a0 Work in the 1930s by Einstein and Nathan Rosen in Princeton revealed a solution of the general relativity equations that describes a bridge between two places/times (regions of what scientists call space-time).", "This so called \u2018Einstein-Rosen bridge\u2019 \u2013 what we now call a wormhole \u2013 could pave the way to the possibility of moving colossal distances across the universe, and even open the door to a form of time travel.

Even brands like Apple, who are now known for their sleek aesthetic, once fell victim to the trend for beige as shown in this 1993 Apple Mac from our collection.", "There are lots of possible reasons as to why personal computers were once beige. When these machines were still a relatively new feature in offices it was thought that an inoffensive, neutral coloured computer would appear less intimidating to the not so technologically savvy \u2013 the idea being that beige computers would blend in seamlessly with the office d\u00e9cor.", "It has also been suggested that the putty coloured computers wouldn\u2019t show their age as much because, charmingly, they already looked a bit dirty. Before the smoking ban came into place in 2007 perhaps an old nicotine-stained computer wouldn\u2019t have looked so different to a new one.", "So, when did beige go out of fashion? Arguably the colour was never in vogue and computer manufacturers just began hiring designers with better taste. The real answer perhaps lies with the iconic black IBM ThinkPad .", "The ThinkPad was a revolution in personal computers, not only for its radical black colour, but also for its innovative design. Based on the aesthetic of a Japanese bento box, the minimalist design was so popular it has become standard computer design across many different brands today.", "Strangely enough, although personal computers were almost always beige, many earlier models originally came in black. So why did IBM switch back from beige to black? According to the ThinkPad book published by IBM in 2000, a German workplace standard came into effect in the late 70s that required light colours for all office equipment.", "This standard became adopted by other European countries and before long all office equipment that wasn\u2019t beige or grey had been eradicated. Of course, computer manufacturers would then only make their products in light colours so they could sell the same products in Europe and in other countries. Inevitably, that meant offices around the world ended up with beige computers.", "However, with the ThinkPad, IBM wanted to make a statement. Instead of blending into office backgrounds, they wanted people to actually notice their computers. IBM was still under pressure to create a line of pebble grey ThinkPads for the German market in compliance with their workplace standards, but they were adamant that the ThinkPad should be black. Eventually Germany approved the black ThinkPads but only if they came with a warning that they were not for office use.", "Clearly IBM\u2019s radical new approach to personal computer design was a risk that paid off. ThinkPad became a huge success from its first release in October 1992. The simple change in design had created a covetable product and a sense of status for the user.", "ThinkPads were the only laptops certified for use on the International Space Station, they have won numerous awards and have gained cult status amongst computer enthusiasts. Fashion trends may be cyclical but thankfully when it comes to computers it doesn\u2019t look like beige will be making a comeback anytime soon.", ""]},

Curiosity is important for many reasons: it helps us to learn about the world, but it can also get us into trouble by leading us to take risks. It also helps memory and both feeling curious and finding out new information can make us feel good. Some studies have even shown that feeling curious can improve mental and physical health. A better understanding of curiosity will help us to establish when it is beneficial and what drives those benefits.", "What makes you feel curious? Research has shown that when we realise that there are gaps in our knowledge in some area, we feel curious and are motivated to seek information to fill the gap. This means that often knowing a little about a subject can make us feel curious because it reveals how much more there is to learn. We are going to test this idea further and see if it applies to children as well as adults. We want to know what other factors can make us feel curious, or can stop us from wanting to know more.", "Previous research has shown that people have different styles of curiosity, but we do not know how these styles translate into differences in information-seeking behaviour. Another of the aims of this study is to further understand when and why different people seek information about things they do not yet know.", "The study involves playing games and answering questions on a computer. Some of the games involve eye-tracking, where a special camera attached to the computer screen can work out where on the screen someone is looking. We use the eye-tracker in the games, so that people will be able to reveal objects just by looking at them. We can use their patterns of looking to understand more about their curiosity.", "For more information about this project see here ."]},

Even so, within a quarter of a second, people are able to discern a song along with its genre: \u2018We are all musical\u2019.", "Every human culture enjoys music, and there are many theories to explain why. Some say that it creates a sense of community, while the Harvard Professor of Psychology Steven Pinker dismisses\u00a0music as little more than \u2018auditory cheesecake\u2019.", "But, though controversial, many suspect that there is an evolutionary explanation. Charles Darwin thought music was to do with sexual selection: \u2018Look at me and how big my guitar is,\u2019 joked Ball.", "Perhaps music taps into the pattern-seeking mental machinery in the brain that says \u2018If I hear the call of a sabre tooth tiger, I ought to get going\u2019 he said, though he added that brain scan studies suggest it involves the reward circuits activated by food, sex and drugs. \u2018You are getting a high from the music.\u2019", "Drawing on the suggestions from the audience, Ball and Stilgoe explored what made a happy song uplifting, the science of sad songs, the art of improvisation and then, as a grand finale, experimented with how to make a happy dirge.", "In the first improvisation session, Stilgoe created a mash up of three \u2018happy\u2019 songs suggested by the audience: Nina Simone\u2019s Feeling Good , Stevie Wonder\u2019s Sir Duke and Gene Kelly\u2019s Singin\u2019 in the Rain.", "Listen here:", "Why are they perceived as happy?\u00a0Stilgoe said nostalgia was one factor when, for example, it comes to Singin\u2019 in the Rain .\u00a0Ball added that, as one 1930s psychologist remarked, music sounds like emotions feel. Or\u00a0\u2018music is the shorthand of emotion,\u2019 as Leo Tolstoy famously put it.", "The way music maps onto emotion can be quite literal. The octave jump in Singin\u2019 in the Rain \u2018mimics, in the shape of music, the emotion we want to invoke,\u2019 said Ball, adding that the same tonal leap can be heard in the uplifting ballad, Over the Rainbow .", "Both agreed that timbre is a factor, with Ball adding that it must be \u2018sharp and cutting\u2019 to be upbeat.", "When it came to the sad songs, the audience suggestions selected by Joe Stilgoe were Yesterday by the Beatles, Why Does it Always Rain on Me? by Travis, along with Arthur Hamilton\u2019s Cry Me a River.", "Listen here:", "We are drawn to\u00a0sad songs and the reason why is a fundamental question, said Ball. \u2018One possibility is that it is cathartic,\u2019 he said.

In a BBC4 programme, The Secret Science Of Pop , Prof Armand Leroi, an evolutionary biologist from Imperial College London, analysed the data from 17,000 chart toppers and then \u2014 with the help of Trevor Horn and singer-songwriter Nik\u00e9 Jemiyo \u2014 attempted to manufacture the perfect pop hit.", "Though many insights emerged, the experiment did not work, said Philip Ball. \u2018There is something ineffable about music that seems to resist that kind of analysis.\u2019 Many hits rely on surprise, on adding something new, he said. \u2018We can science it as much as we like, we can\u2019t get to the bottom of it.\u2019", "And even though different cultures are \u2018pretty good\u2019 at working out the mood of other culture\u2019s music, said Ball,\u00a0we often make assumptions about the mood of minor and major scales, so cultural conditioning also plays a role.", "Guided by Milton,\u00a0they\u00a0turned to the science of improvisation itself. Given the physical constraints of getting inside a MRI scanner, there have been few studies of brain activity while playing an instrument but those that have been done have provided insights.", "As Geoff Goodhill of the University of Queensland has explained, improvisation draws on two key neural circuits \u2013 the default network, which is most active when the mind is wandering, and the executive control network, which becomes more active when focused on a task.", "In jazz improvisation, the default network likely allows the musician to riff around a basic structure laid down by executive control.", "At the end of the evening, Jon Milton challenged his guests\u00a0to turn a dirge into a storming finale.

The nasal cavity opens into the pharynx, which, lower down, communicates with the back of the oral cavity. Then the ways divide, with air passing forwards into the larynx and thence to the lungs, and food passing backwards, down into the oesophagus. At least \u2013 that\u2019s what meant to happen, but the usual set-up allows food to go down the wrong way \u2013 towards the windpipe, while air can get swallowed. How ridiculous. Let\u2019s separate the airway completely from the passageway for food and avoid choking.", "This is a supreme example of untidiness, and it comes down to the way that the body evolved and how it is built as an embryo \u2013 with no foresight. Nerves grow out to the muscles of the developing larynx early on in development, when the heart and its vessels are still up in the neck region. When the heart later descends into the chest, dragging its arteries with it, the nerves that supply the larynx are trapped under a pair of arteries and get dragged down. The pattern we end up with is a nerve that arises high up in the neck level with the larynx, runs right down into the chest, before looping under an artery then running back (recurring) to the voicebox. It should be simple to tidy this one up.", "", "The flow of air through our lungs is bidirectional \u2013 air goes in and comes out the same way. Birds have a different set-up which involves air being drawn into accessory air sacs in the abdomen and chest, which then contract to keep air flowing through the passageways of the lungs in one direction. This makes gas exchange \u2013 absorbing oxygen into the blood and getting rid of carbon dioxide \u2013 more efficient. So I\u2019d like to steal this secret for the new \u2018me\u2019.", "We each possess a pair of coronary arteries supplying our heart muscle with oxygenated blood \u2013 but any links between these arteries are so small as to be practically non-existent. If one coronary artery becomes blocked, then an area of heart muscles becomes fatally deprived of oxygen and dies \u2013 this is precisely what happens in a myocardial infarction or heart attack. Other animals, including dogs and guinea pigs, have plenty of links between the arteries, so that areas of heart muscle are supplied by both vessels. If there\u2019s a blockage in one, the other artery can take over. This seems like a great idea \u2013 and something other mammals already possess, so I\u2019m adopting it too.", "", "Our long, flexible lumbar spines are great in many ways \u2013 they help us to run efficiently, for instance \u2013 but they have their drawbacks. The lumbar vertebrae are under great strain and, as we age, the ligaments that hold the pulpy centres of the intervertebral discs in place dry out. The pulp can be pushed out \u2013 and the herniated disc can press on nerves and cause back pain and sciatica. As a sufferer of a slipped disc, I\u2019d like to opt for a \u2018chimpanzee fix\u2019 here \u2013 reducing the lumbar spine from five to four vertebrae, and building up the iliac wings of the pelvis to stabilise the spine even more.

In a series of experiments conducted between 1886 and 1888, Heinrich Hertz demonstrated the transmission of electromagnetic waves, proving Maxwell right and opening up a new technological age, one in which electromagnetic signals could be beamed across the planet, radically shrinking the size of the world and allowing communication at a distance never before imagined.", "Although Maxwell never lived to see the full impact of his work, those who followed in his footsteps transformed the scientific landscape. It was Maxwell\u2019s wave equation that inspired Einstein\u2019s theory of special relativity, which did away with the lumineferous aether and recast the very notions of space and time.

The issues he has handled have stretched from shale gas and space weather to black swans. \u2018It\u2019s a mad job,\u201d he joked.", "Since he stepped into the hot seat at the start of 2008, Sir John has given key advice to Government during a number of huge stories, such as the 2009 swine flu outbreak, the 2010 volcanic ash incident, and the 2011 Fukushima nuclear crisis.", "Sir John described how, as chair of Sage (Science Advisory Group in Emergencies) that feeds in to Cobra (a reference to Cabinet Office Briefing Room A, used to handle a crisis), he had to reassure Prime Minister David Cameron that, despite the more hysterical press reports, the wider radiological fallout of Fukushima was much less than Britons would encounter if they evacuated Tokyo on a flight to London.", "The ability of Government to make appropriate use of science has been a central issue. He has been responsible for forming a network of those with science and engineering backgrounds within government (now around 4000 strong at the last count) and encouraging all major departments of state to recruit a Chief Scientific Adviser: he illustrated this with a PowerPoint slide of mugshots of the 18 Government Chief Scientists, including a shadowy androgynous cut-out figure in MI5.", "One might quibble about the details of how well this is working but, as a Lords Select Committee recently concluded, these advisors are critical, not least because they deal with issues that cut across departments and that can outlive the lifetimes of politicians, such as securing food and energy.", "Throughout 2008 and 2009 Sir John raised the concept of the \u201cPerfect Storm\u201d of food, energy and water security in the context of climate change, a global population that will soar by a billion in the next 13 years, and the ever-increasing proportion in vulnerable urban environments, raising this as a priority for the international community.", "Sir John has led the way in producing report after report working through the consequences, notably the link between food insecurity and social unrest.

However, it was perhaps significant that the most he could find to say about his trip was how bad the weather was in Rio.", "At a \u201cResilient Cities\u201d event the summit Sir John made an urgent appeal for scientists to use plain language if they are to play a larger role in policymaking on climate change, notably to convey an accurate measure of the risks. One example is the use of GM crops to do away with pesticides, where the existing risks of intensive farming are often neglected in the public debate.", "He adopted a high profile during the recent furore about genetically altered crops, as demonstrators gathered to protest against the planting of GM wheat in open fields at Rothamsted Research in Hertfordshire. Sir John argued that GM had to be part of a bigger plan to feed the world and predicted enormous increases in the demand for GM food, without which we could expect increased food prices that would harm the poorest of the poor, in particular.", "When asked by Bob Ward of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment about the legacy of the \u2018Climategate\u2019 e-mails that were hacked from the University of East Anglia, Sir John pointed out that he thought some climate scientists had been harassed through the use of the Freedom of Information Act, but rightly stressed the need for openness and transparency, and to make data available so that research results can be tested through replication.", "Sir John was surprisingly outspoken in his criticism of how poorly he feels the European Union is dealing with some issues of risk, highlighting, for instance, the problem of banning some substances purely because of their potential hazard, but failing to take into account whether the low levels of exposure actually constitute any significant risk to public health. On one point in particular, he could not hide his exasperation: \u201cthere is complete idiocy.\u201d", "I asked Sir John if the Chief Scientist should have more power to decide policy, rather than just advise? This would not be unprecedented: in monetary policy, a huge amount of power is devolved to Mervyn King and the Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee, presumably because politicians recognise that monetary policy is complex and should be left to the experts.", "Surely the same be more true when it comes to aspects of science and engineering policy? No, came back the reply, because power corrupts. It is better to provide advice and insights and, as one example, he explained how a committee is now investigating the use of computer trading in financial markets, where avalanches of pre-programmed trading \u2013 up to a quarter of a million per second \u2013 can cause huge shifts in share price and market instability.", "He also revealed his guiding principle when it comes to dealing with Government and NGOs alike, quoting Steven Chu, the Nobel prize winning physicist who is currently Energy Secretary in the United States: \u201cPeople are entitled to their own opinions, but not their own facts\u201d"]},

With technology advancing at an ever-increasing pace, where might things like Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning lead us? And with ever more sophisticated means by which to measure the human body\u2019s physical state, how might these be utilised to create the optimum sonic experience?", "The discussion centred around Ecstatic Data Sets: The Apeiron Chorismos Scanner , newly published on Rough Trade Books and authored by panelist Sam Potter of cult band Late of the Pier. Joining him were two of the technologists whose work directly influenced the book, music producer and ex-NASA scientist Dr Kelly Snook, adaptive/algorithmic composer Robert Thomas, and artist Hannah Peel, whose studies into the effects of music on dementia patients were the inspiration for her 2016 album Awake but Always Dreaming .", "Ecstatic Data Sets is a pamphlet containing a speculative design for an imagined machine that \u201clistens\u201d to the user, taking detailed measurements of the body\u2019s functions and neural activity, to provide a tailored soundtrack to elevate the user\u2019s mood and alleviate \u201cadverse\u201d states of mind such as anxiety or paranoia. Access to a cloud-based store of archive music and machine learning-enabled composition-on-the-fly allow it to provide the user with a sort of musically-assisted mental equilibrium. With increased regular use by a great enough number of people, it can eventually work out how to stimulate states of ecstasy \u2013 tapping into its ecstatic data sets .", "The proposed machine doesn\u2019t yet exist in real-life, but as the pamphlet assures us, the technology for it does; and the likes of Robert Thomas, Dr Kelly Snook and Hannah Peel are amongst those working at the forefront of the technology and ideas that inspire the speculative design. So exactly how close are we to having a device like the\u00a0Apeiron Chorismos Scanner?", "As Robert Thomas discusses, there are numerous examples of this technology already. The Hear and Now mindful breathing app, developed in part with Thomas, monitors the user\u2019s heart rate during meditation \u2013 the algorithmically-generated music will adapt to the user and create a different arrangement to direct them towards a meditative state. There are even, apparently, ways to cheat the system by imagining the music that might bring about this state; \u2018What it does is set a feedback loop between you and the system so you\u2019re affecting the music; that moves the music to a different position, and because the music has an emotional effect on you, it goes around\u2019. Thomas has also produced algorithmic music for a similar meditation app which, rather than measuring heart rate via a wristband, uses an EEG headset to assess the meditative state.", "Artificial Intelligence in music, meanwhile, is all the rage these days. Nick Cave might have recently proclaimed that \u2018 an AI will never write a great song \u2018, but you can bet your bottom dollar they won\u2019t stop trying.\u00a0One could make a compelling case that machine learning already has its fingerprints on mainstream listening habits, with Spotify\u2019s recommended tracks based on subscribers\u2019 prior listening, and on the cutting edge of AI-generated music, companies like Australian startup Popgun are \u2018using Deep Learning to develop an Artificial Intelligence to create awesome pop songs\u2019.", "More recently Siri co-founder Tom Gruber announced his new venture LifeScore, a new AI with the potential to conjure up musical compositions based on the behaviours and actions of listeners, from how they\u2019re feeling to the pace that they walk. Not unlike the Apeiron Chorismos Scanner.", "The quest to create autonomous music isn\u2019t a new one of course. In 1987 David Cope developed Experiments in Music Intelligence, or \u201cEmi\u201d, a programme capable of reading music in the form of musical code. Fed any number of classical compositions, Emi could then regurgitate a new composition based on the scores it had previously read. Go even further back and you find the mechanical music boxes of 19th century European clockmakers, or the autonomous Flute Player built by Jacques de Vaucanson in 1738. Heck, you have to rewind all the way to 9th Century Baghdad to find the earliest example of a mechanical musical instrument \u2013 the hydropower organ invented by the Banu Musa brothers and described in their Book of Ingenious Devices .", "So, we\u2019ve been thinking about autonomous music for literally millennia, and for time immemorial striving to create machines and software that can play something for us to listen to. The intriguing thing now \u2013 as Jarvis and co uncover in their fascinating discussion\u00a0\u2013 is that we\u2019re on the cusp of making machine music that listens to us .", "Listen to the full discussion here:", "\ufeff"]},

This analysis of society at the end of the twentieth century was written in 1998 by Stewart Brand (born 1938), writer, inventor and founder of the Whole Earth Catalog .", "Brand, together with computer designer Danny Hillis (born 1956) and other prominent fin de si\u00e8cle thinkers, had become increasingly concerned that the year 2000 had come to be seen as a temporal mental barrier to the future. Brand explained: \u2018Some sort of balancing corrective to the short-sightedness is needed\u2014some mechanism or myth that encourages the long view and the taking of long-term responsibility, where \u201cthe long term\u201d is measured at least in centuries\u2019.", "Hillis\u2019s proposal was to build \u2018both a mechanism and a myth\u2019, a monumental-scale mechanical clock capable of telling time for 10,000 years\u2014if it was maintained properly. Such a clock would prompt conversations about \u2018deep time\u2019, perhaps becoming a public icon for time in the same way that photographs of earth from space taken by the Apollo 8 crew in December 1968 have become icons for a fragile planet in boundless space (It was partly due to Brand\u2019s agitation that NASA released earlier satellite-based photographs of earth to the public in 1966).", "In 1996, Brand and Hillis formed a board of like-minded friends. Calling themselves \u2018 The Long Now Foundation \u2019, the organization\u2019s title sprang from a suggestion by musician and composer Brian Eno that \u2018The Long Now\u2019 could be seen as an important extension of human temporal horizons.", "In this scheme, \u2018now\u2019 was seen as the present moment plus or minus a day, and \u2018nowadays\u2019 extended the time horizon to a decade or so forward and backward. However, the \u2018long now\u2019 would dramatically extend this \u2018time envelope\u2019.

With occasional maintenance, it was thought that the clock should reasonably be expected to display the correct time for 10,000 years. It was designed to be maintainable with Bronze Age technology. The plan was also that it should be possible to determine the operational principles of the clock by close inspection, to improve the clock over time and to build working models of the clock from table-top to monumental size using the same design.", "In 1997, a small team of expert engineers, mechanics and designers based in San Francisco, led by Alexander Rose, set about constructing a prototype of the Clock of the Long Now , as the project became known.

The slowest-moving part of this display indicates the precession of the equinoxes.", "As the designer of some of the world\u2019s fastest supercomputers in the 1980s, Danny Hillis said in the 1990s that he wished to \u2018atone for his sins\u2019 of speeding up the world by designing the world\u2019s slowest computer for the Clock of the Long Now.", "This range of tempos reflects the Foundation\u2019s idea of \u2018layers of time\u2019 in human existence. The fastest-changing layer is fashion and art; a little slower is commerce. Infrastructure and governance take still longer to change. Cultures change very slowly, with nature reflecting the slowest tempo of all. \u2018The fast layers innovate; the slow layers stabilize\u2019, explained Brand. The Foundation believes that an understanding of the opportunities and threats embodied in these layers of temporal change is crucial in correcting humankind\u2019s apparent short-sightedness.", "These ambitions and ideals were expressed eloquently in the finished prototype clock, which first ticked in San Francisco moments before the end of New Year\u2019s Eve 1999. It was then moved to London, where the Clock of the Long Now had been selected as the final exhibit in the Science Museum\u2019s Making the Modern World gallery, opened by Her Majesty The Queen in 2000.", "Meanwhile, the Foundation continued to build further prototypes, refining the design of the clock\u2019s several constituent subassemblies in preparation for the construction (now underway) of a 10,000-year clock inside a mountain in western Texas, near the town of Van Horn. The Foundation hopes to build several \u2018millennial clocks\u2019 over the course of time, and a site for another has been purchased atop a mountain in eastern Nevada, adjacent to Great Basin National Park.", "By its nature, the clock is both a conclusion\u2014of a long process of human thinking, making and acting\u2014and a starting point, for a long future, the contents of which are uncertain, the opportunities of which are infinite.

Some, as Warnock put it, thought that this was tantamount to \u2018throwing a baby away.\u2019 Consternation followed the admission by Edwards in a February 1982 television documentary that he had experimented on embryos he had no intention of implanting into patients: \u2018they can teach us things about early human life\u2019.", "In June of 1982 Norman Fowler, the Government\u2019s Secretary of State for Health and Social Services, wrote to Warnock, then a University of Oxford philosopher and educationalist, to invite her to advise ministers on whether IVF should be banned and, if it did go ahead, how it should be regulated. Warnock had huge respect for the public who she believed were \u2018entitled to know, and even to control\u2019 professional practices, an appetite for public engagement that feels very contemporary.", "Warnock herself was \u2018completely ignorant\u2019 about embryology and the earliest stages of human development and, despite the broad representation on her select committee, she needed help. One member alone would prove crucial to the outcome of her inquiry: the Cambridge University developmental biologist, Anne McLaren.", "In recognition of how the early embryo is not the same as a person, or a child, 14 days was adopted as the limit for embryo research. In paragraph 45, the Warnock report recommended that \u2018it be a criminal offence to handle or to use as a research subject any live human embryo derived from in vitro fertilisation beyond that limit (i.e. fourteen days after fertilisation)\u2019.", "The 14-day limit was chosen for good reason. First, Mary Warnock wanted an unequivocal limit that rested on a defined period rather than a stage of development, which could at best be open to interpretation.\u00a0Moreover, 14 days was around that time a human embryo elongates and develops a line called the primitive streak, which marks a channel where the spinal cord will eventually grow. Some have described this as the first developmental stage at which the embryo can develop into a more complex organism which can plausibly be nothing other than a human being.", "The reception to her report was, she admits, mixed. Of all her opponents perhaps the most implacable was the chief rabbi, Immanuel Jacobowitz. He mounted attack after attack \u2013 one Times article carried the headline \u2018Warnock destroys morality\u2019. This headline, she recalled with a wry smile, delighted her husband Geoffrey, a fellow philosopher and then Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford.", "When the legislation eventually came before them, parliamentarians were offered a choice between prohibiting all embryo research and permitting it in defined circumstances.\u00a0 By then the public debate had moved on, focusing now on the possibilities of adapting the now established method of IVF to screen embryos for genetic disease. Aware of the possibilities, parliamentarians chose the latter course to allow IVF and experimentation but legislated that embryos could not be kept or used \u2018after the appearance of the primitive streak\u2019.\u00a0 The 14-day limit became law.", "In recent years, Warnock believes that her report has held up \u2018quite well, particularly the 14-day rule\u2019. She told me that if ever she feels despondent, she reassures herself by thinking about her report: \u2018Well, at least I did that \u2019.", "But even the Warnock report envisaged that a day would come when the 14-day limit would be challenged with \u2018the maintenance of developing embryos in an artificial environment (ectogenesis) for progressively longer periods\u2019.\u00a0Only recently has it become possible to grow embryos for longer than 14 days, in the light of recent work in the University of Cambridge by Magdalena Zernicka-Goetz and in America and this could pave the way for research to improve IVF efficacy by identifying markers of successful development, help understand the causes of early embryo loss in pregnancy end the misery of miscarriage, and further understand the effects of drugs, alcohol and toxic compounds in embryos.", "Baroness Warnock agrees that there is a great deal that could be learned by extending this limit but argues that the public need more time to understand the basics of what was being proposed and what scientists want to do with embryos grown for longer in the laboratory. If this advance in growing human embryos immediately prompted a loosening of legislation to, say, a 21-day limit, then it would stir ever-present fears about sliding down the \u2018slippery slope\u2019.", "In the longer term, there are other points at which a line might be drawn to curb embryo research, and these were also explored by the Warnock Committee. Perhaps in the beginnings of a central nervous system (at around 22\u201323 days) or much later, when functional activity in the brain can show if pain could be felt (today we know that connections to the cortex are not intact before 24 weeks of gestation and, as most neuroscientists believe that the cortex is necessary for pain perception, the foetus cannot experience pain in any sense prior to this point in gestation).", "Decades later, the thinking in the Warnock report remains as relevant as ever.", "Baroness Warnock was a Patron of the Progress Educational Trust and won the Dan David Prize in 2018.", ""]},

This chair was elaborate in its design with plush upholstery, arm and leg rests, and four small wheels which meant that he (conveniently) needed to be pushed around by a servant.", "The first self-propelled wheelchair was invented in 1655 by paraplegic clock-maker of Nuremberg, Germany Stephan Farfler (1633-1689), who built his own mobility aid when he was only 22 after having broken his back as a child.", "Using his mechanical expertise as a clock-maker, Fafler\u2019s wheelchair frame was based on a three-wheel chassis and worked by turning handles attached to a geared front wheel using a system of cranks and cogwheels.", "While it wouldn\u2019t be for another few hundred years until the invention of the bicycle, it is easy to see this wheelchair as a forerunner.", "The Science Museum Group has an interesting example of a self-propelled chair inspired by Fafler\u2019s design in its collection . Built in Britain between 1910-1920, this chair has three main wheels and driven via chains by two hand cranks either side of the rider.", "From the second-half of the eighteenth century a number of important wheelchair developments occurred in the town of Bath. At this time Bath was a popular spa town destination for the sick and disabled from across Britain and Europe who sought comfort and healing from the mineral waters and physical therapy offered there.", "To meet the demand created by immobile visitors wishing to take the waters, a number of wheelchairs were designed and became available to rent. The most popular design of this period was that of John Dawson whose 1783 \u2018Bath Chair\u2019 was a model supported by two wheels joined by an axle underneath the seat, with a small pivoting wheel in front of the supporting footrest.", "The Bath Chair could be steered by the rider via a long curved rod connected to the front wheel, though it still had to be pushed by an attendant. Variations of the Bath Chair quickly became very popular and soon rivalled the Sedan chair (an enclosed box with a seat carried on poles by two men) as a form of transportation for wealthy disabled people across Britain. The Science Museum Group Collection even has a Bath Chair made for Queen Victoria in 1893 for her later, less agile years.", "Patents show that throughout the nineteenth century many improvements were made to the wheelchair to promote comfort, manoeuvrability and independence, including the invention of rear push wheels and push-rims.", "Perhaps the most commercially successful wheelchair to be marketed was the revolutionary \u2018X-frame\u2019 folding wheelchair. Developed in the 1930s by American engineers Harry Jennings and Herbert Everest \u2013 after the latter became paraplegic in a mining accident \u2013 the relatively lightweight and easily transportable chair is still familiar today.", "The Science Museum Group Collection has a \u2018Model 8\u2019 version of this folding wheelchair built in the 1950s. Used in hospitals, nursing homes and private institutions, the Model 8 could be manoeuvred either by the patient via the metal rims attached to each wheel or by an assistant pushing the chair.", "Unprecedented advancements in manual wheelchair technology have been witnessed since the 1930s with materials such as aluminium and titanium making devices much lighter than older steel versions, and with the advent of athletic models specifically adapted for sports performance.", "The \u2018Shadow Racer\u2019 sports wheelchair for example, was designed for track and road racing by Jim Martinson, an injured Vietnam veteran. Manufactured by the company Quickie Designs in the early 1990s alongside tennis and basketball chairs, the development of sports wheelchairs highlights the role of personal ambition driving technological adaptions and advancements.", "Today the wheelchair is one of the most commonly used assistive devices for enhancing the personal mobility of people with disabilities. Considered a basic human right for people with limited mobility by the World Health Organisation , it opens up a world of independence and enables participation in social, economic and cultural life.", "International Wheelchair Day is a welcome moment both to celebrate the innovative technological advancements which have changed the lives of millions, but also to consider the reality that throughout history \u2013 as is still the case today in most developing countries \u2013 only the privileged few who need wheelchairs actually have access to them."]},

Unlike other serious illnesses of the time, pulmonary tuberculosis was associated with fragility and sexual attractiveness.", "The consumptive appearance entailed dramatically pale skin, an ethereal thinness, with red cheeks and a feverish glow. This became the defining fashionable aesthetic of the time with women powdering their faces, some even using chemicals such as arsenic to achieve a paler complexion.", "This obsession with the \u2018consumptive aesthetic\u2019 peaked in the mid-1800s, when corsets and voluminous skirts further emphasized women\u2019s slender figures with damaging implications for women\u2019s physical health and social roles. The restrictive nature of the corset made all but the smallest of physical tasks challenging, and excessive use could lead to displacement of internal organs.", "This traditional consumptive look was perpetuated throughout popular culture with famous portraits, novels, plays and operas telling tales of ethereally thin and beautiful women teeteringly close to death, or inspired creatives overcome with the disease. Alexandre Dumas\u2019 1848 novel La Dame aux Cam\u00e9lias (commonly known as Camille), was later adapted into an opera with character Marguerite Gautier clutching her blood-spotted handkerchief in a prelude to her death.", "This consumptive cultural trope has continued through to the modern day, meaning we\u2019re now almost trained to recognise the coughing of blood into a handkerchief in act 1 meaning the inevitable death of that character by act 3!", "Robert Koch\u2019s discovery of the tubercle basillus in 1882 was a major event in the history of medicine.", "After centuries of speculation, Koch proved that the slow-growing microorganism Mycobacterium Tuberculosis caused the disease and established its contagious nature. The cause of so much death was boiled down to this single-celled living organism.", "Once the cause of TB had been identified, its severity and contagious nature became better understood. As the century progressed, the disease, once so clouded in romantic imagery and mystery, was revealed to be much more prosaic. Romantic portrayals and perceptions of consumption were gradually replaced with scientific facts, and the once-mysterious disease was transformed into a public health problem."]},

I was interested, but this kind of study had never been done before and we didn\u2019t know if it was possible to achieve any results from such old samples. Bones that had been buried for over 70 years would be very difficult to extract DNA from, as it degrades over time.

Pavel carried the bones from Russia and we transferred them to the Forensic Science Service, where the work began.", "A small team of scientists worked with me and Pavel on the remains \u2013 Kevin Sullivan, Gillian Tully, Colin Kimpton, Nicola Benson and Romelle Piercy. We thought that the main problem we would face was \u2018contamination\u2019. Since the bones were discovered they had been handled by lots of different people. DNA is present in sweat, skin cells and saliva, so their DNA could be present on the bones as well.", "We developed strict quality protocols to deal with this. We all wore clean lab coats and facemasks to prevent saliva spray while talking. To remove any modern DNA from the surface of the bones we filed them with sandpaper and took a small section of bone for analysis. As expected, we could only find very small amounts of DNA present in the bones. Each sample contained DNA originating from just half a dozen cells.", "To determine if the remains belonged to the Romanovs, we needed to compare them to samples from verified relatives. We were fortunate to obtain blood samples from HRH Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, who is a direct descendant of the Tsarina Alexandra. Samples were also obtained from the Duke of Fife and Princess Xenia Cheremeteff Sfiri, who are related to the Tsar. The remains matched their living royal relatives and we therefore knew we had found the bones of the Romanovs.", "But this wasn\u2019t the end of the story. Other scientists were surprised we\u2019d been able to obtain any DNA from such old remains, and a very small section of the Tsar\u2019s DNA sequence didn\u2019t match his living relatives. We worked for another year to verify our results, but some still considered our findings controversial. A number of different groups of scientists in the USA and Russia worked to confirm or discount our results. One group even exhumed the body of the Tsar\u2019s brother, George, from the St Petersburg cathedral. But each new test confirmed our original findings.", "Our work identifying the Tsar\u2019s remains helped to create the UK national DNA database and accelerated the development of new methods for forensic testing with small samples of DNA.

Bazalgette had designed for a healthier future and through his work he arguably prevented more death and disease in this country than any other Victorian.", "Initially a railway engineer, Bazalgette was employed as a surveyor in the newly created Metropolitan Commission of Sewers in 1849 before becoming its engineer three years later.", "With London\u2019s population more than doubling between 1800 and 1850, existing systems of human waste collection, removal and disposal were being overwhelmed.", "One of the Commission\u2019s first moves was to order the closure of domestic cesspits. Dug on open ground or beneath housing, they were the traditional means of storing human waste. Houses were instead to be connected to the existing sewers, which emptied directly into the River Thames.", "Ironically, these measures were a response to the growing recognition that the health of the city, and its citizens, were in urgent need of improvement.", "Britain\u2019s first cholera outbreak had reached London in 1832, killing several thousand. It was a key event from which a momentum for such reforms emerged. Given the then prevailing belief in the miasma theory, whereby diseases were caused by foul-smelling air-born vapours, sanitary reform was viewed as particularly crucial. Unfortunately, the theory itself was nonsense.", "Cholera is a water-born disease and when it struck London again in 1848, over 14,000 died. The result of actively removing waste from thousands of households had been to contaminate the Thames \u2013 the city\u2019s main water supply.", "Miasma theory was wrong, but it was the smell, or rather the \u2018stink\u2019, of London that was the tipping point. By the mid-1800s, the Thames was an open sewer where tons of faecal matter washed back and forth on daily tides. During the hot summer of 1858 the stench was overwhelming, especially for the Thameside occupants of the Houses of Parliament.", "\u2018 The Great Stink \u2019 focused the minds of politicians who sanctioned a building project on a hitherto unseen scale. The task of building a new sewer network was assigned to the Metropolitan Board of Works, the successor to the earlier Commission, and its chief engineer Joseph Balzalgette.", "His solution was a system that channeled sewage and waste water through miles of tunnels into a series of main intercepting sewers. Set at a slight gradient, and assisted by pumping stations, they slowly transported it eastwards where it was ejected into sections of the Thames where it would be swept out to sea.", "Fortunately, Bazalgette insisted on broad brick-walled tunnels rather than the narrow pipes favoured by some contemporaries. Considered as unnecessarily extravagant at the time, it allowed the system to cope with the subsequent increases in volume.", "As well as making the single biggest improvement to the health of Victorian Londoners, it transformed the city above as well below ground. Long stretches of the intercepting sewers were hidden beneath vast embankments along the Thames. This reclaimed many acres of land and also changed the character of the river, which became much narrower and faster flowing.", "The project progressed remarkably quickly, with much of London connected up by the end of 1865. Nevertheless, delays to allow new Underground lines to be housed in the embankments helped enable a final cholera epidemic the following year.", "Of course, tons of raw sewage were also still being dumped further down-river into the Thames \u2013 sometimes with dreadful results. The death toll from the sinking of the pleasure boat Princess Alice in 1878 would have been smaller if it hadn\u2019t sunk close to one of the sewage outfalls. Over 600 passengers died, many poisoned rather than drowned. The horror of this event prompted the subsequent building of riverside sewage treatment plants.", "Such unfortunate incidents aside, Bazalgette\u2019s creation has served generations well over many decades. This in spite of an increasing population and the emergence of hazards he would never have foreseen \u2013 such as wet wipes and fatbergs !", "While significant expansion and improvements to the system continue, the many miles of Victorian tunnels remain at the core of the system.", "So let\u2019s all raise a glass \u2013 of something drinkable \u2013 and say Happy Birthday, Joseph Bazalgette!"]},

He would become known as Viscount Nuffield.", "You may be wondering why a medical curator is writing about car manufacturing?

For the latter, the only treatment option was an iron lung. Few hospitals were able to afford the \u00a31000 each machine cost.", "Nuffield began his mission to spread iron lungs across the world in 1938 after hearing a plea for a iron lung on the radio and offered a part of his factory to manufacture them. At the time, the Both iron lung that Nuffield began to make was not seen as the best model on the market and he was criticised for his \u201cwasteful benevolence.\u201d", "Nuffield went on to manufacture 700 of the Both-type iron lungs\u00a0machines in his workshops. In total, he donated over 5000 iron lungs. One is on display at his former home, Nuffield Place . If you look closely at our iron lung, many of the parts look like they were modelled on car parts.", "Today, the Nuffield name lives on in the many other medical institutions and posts that William Morris endowed including Nuffield Department of Surigcal Sciences and the Nuffield College at the University of Oxford and the Nuffield Foundation .

This included the popular Nintendo Game & Watch range launched in 1980. The devices were designed by Gunpei Yokoi, a maintenance engineer who had impressed the President of Nintendo with his homemade toys during a chance visit to the factory Yokoi worked in. Yokoi became one of Nintendo\u2019s leading designers and helped shape the company into the gaming giant we know today.", "In 1989 Yokoi\u2019s Game Boy was released by Nintendo. It featured a monochrome display and simple technology which helped with battery life. It was bundled with games like Super Mario Land and Tetris , which were huge hits, making the Game Boy an immediate success.", "Other consoles were launched around the same time by Nintendo\u2019s rivals Atari and Sega. Both the Atari Lynx and Sega Game Gear were more advanced than the Game Boy, including more powerful graphics and colour displays. Power came at a cost though, with both consoles being bulkier than the Game Boy and having much shorter battery lives. Battery life was made even worse with Game Gear\u2019s unusual TV tuner add-on which turned your games console into a portable TV\u2026 for a short amount of time.", "As technology moved on through the 90s consoles got lighter and more advanced. Nintendo finally made the leap into colour gaming with the Game Boy Color in 1998, keeping away competition including the SNK Neo Geo Pocket and Bandai Wonderswan \u2013 the last product to be designed by Gunpei Yokoi having left Nintendo.", "Nintendo continued to release new versions of its console, each aiming to improve the format; from the Game Boy Advance (2001) and flip-screen Game Boy Advance SP (2003) through to the tiny Game Boy Micro (2005) with its 5cm screen.", "About this time the mobile phone market started trying to get in on the action with the launch of the Nokia N-Gage in 2003. An attempt at a hybrid between a mobile phone and a games console the phone struggled to be great at either. The phone\u2019s battery had to be removed to change the game cartridge and the button layout made gaming difficult. Mobile phones would stick to Snake for a few more years.", "Nintendo finally began to retire the Game Boy brand in 2004 with the release of the DS. Its dual screen display opened new ways of playing; a format that has remained through 10 variations to the present day. This includes the 3DS released in 2011, allowing 3D gaming without glasses.", "Meanwhile Sony had their own plans to enter the handheld market, introducing the PSP (PlayStation Portable) in early 2005. Featuring high quality graphics and major support from big-name game developers, many saw this as the first real challenge to Nintendo\u2019s reign over the handheld market. The PSP and its successor the Vita which launched in 2011 had some success, but around 2008 and along with Nintendo\u2019s consoles they faced the biggest shift in portable gaming since the Game Boy was released almost 20 years earlier\u2026", "In 2007 Apple released the first iPhone and a year later they opened the App Store. Now people could start downloading games directly to their mobile phone. The following year Angry Birds was released, and soon casual gaming began to shape the entire industry.

Mobile gaming also seems to have made gaming more accessible to women; 49% of mobile gamers are women compared to 41% of gamers overall.", "But the story doesn\u2019t end there for handheld consoles. In 2017 Nintendo released the Switch. A hybrid console that both docks to a screen for home gaming but can also be used in \u2018tablet mode\u2019, allowing people to flexibly play at home and on the go.

A relatively simple way to settle the matter would be to compare photographs of the eclipse from two different locations. If prominences were Earth or Moon-based, the observations from different sites ought to differ, but if prominences were solar in origin, they should match.", "Happily, an Italian Jesuit astronomer named Father Angelo Secchi had established his own observation post a few hundred miles to the south, and he managed to capture some half-decent shots of his own of the Sun at eclipse. Not as clear as those taken using the Kew photoheliograph, these images were just sufficient for the job. By comparing his own shots with those of Secchi\u2019s, de la Rue established that the features observed were identical on each.", "The greatest astronomical question of the age had been answered \u2013 the prominences were indeed features of the Sun. Moreover, the solution had come from photography.", "De la Rue and the Kew photoheliograph had shown that luminous prominences invisible to the naked eye could be captured in photographs \u2013 setting the standard for all future devices.

It was back in 1990 that scientists at NASA first began to discuss sending a probe to the Sun. The team have had to overcome enormous technical challenges as well as cancellations, delays and budget issues to finally be at a point where they can deliver this once in a generation mission. There are sure to be some very nervous people watching Saturday morning as their precious spacecraft gets blasted into space on top of tens of thousands of tons of highly explosive rocket fuel.", "Despite being the largest and brightest object in the sky, there is still a lot we don\u2019t understand about our Sun. Why does the corona \u2013 the ghostly halo of light that becomes visible around the Sun during a total eclipse \u2013 have a temperature of millions of degrees Celsius when the surface of the Sun is at only 5730 degrees? How is the solar wind \u2013 the stream of charged particles that constantly buffets the Earth \u2013 accelerated into space?", "Perhaps the most significant issue that Parker will help to address is the threat posed to human activity by solar storms. Despite its tranquil appearance from the surface of the Earth, the Sun is a dynamic and often violent body, sporadically firing vast clouds of charged particles into space.", "These \u2018coronal mass ejections\u2019 have the power to knock out satellites and power grids, if we were unlucky enough for one to hit the Earth. Improving our understanding of these solar storms is essential in predicting when they might occur and in giving more warning of an impending storm to the people who run our power, transport and communications networks.

If you follow this link to the Zooniverse site, you can help scientists decide which coronal mass ejections look the most dangerous and ultimately improve our ability to predict and forecast space weather.", "The engineering challenges faced by the Parker team have been enormous. The spacecraft will fly closer to the Sun than any before, coming within 4% of the distance between the Earth and the Sun. At such close quarters the intense sunlight will heat Parker to a searing 1377 degrees Celsius, hot enough to melt steel.", "If Parker\u2019s delicate instruments were exposed to this fearsome light they would be destroyed instantly, and so the entire spacecraft is hunkered down behind a super-advanced heat shield made of a carbon-carbon composite, which will keep the rest of the spacecraft at a balmy 29 degrees Celsius.", "In fact, Parker will come so close to the Sun that it can\u2019t carry any telescopes that look directly at the Sun \u2013 they would melt! Instead, instruments behind the heat shield will measure and sample the particles in the solar wind and the magnetic field, while a specially designed telescope will look sideways out of the craft to image the solar wind as it flows away from the Sun.", "Saturday marks the beginning of a long journey that will take Parker ever closer to our nearest star. While most spacecraft try to increase their speed to escape the Sun\u2019s gravity, Parker actually needs to slow itself down compared to the Earth so that the Sun\u2019s gravity can take hold and pull Parker in. In late September, Parker will fly past Venus, and use the planet\u2019s gravity to slow down the speed of its orbit. From here, Parker will literally fall towards the Sun, making its first closest approach on 3\u00a0November.", "This first flyby of the Sun, or \u2018perihelion\u2019, will be a real moment of drama for the mission team, who will be waiting expectantly for the first data to be returned from close to the Sun (and also to see if their spacecraft survives the encounter). Over the next seven years, Parker will use flybys of Venus to repeatedly fall further and further towards the Sun, reaching its closest approach on 21\u00a0December 2024.", "At this point, the Sun\u2019s gravitational pull will have accelerated Parker to a whopping 700,000 kilometres per hour \u2013 that\u2019s fast enough to travel from London to Manchester in one second \u2013 making Parker the fastest manmade object in history.", "The launch of the Parker Solar Probe marks the beginning of an exciting new chapter in our exploration of the Sun.

In his early career he described himself as an artist, and only later a chemist. He might also have described himself as a metallurgist.", "A decorative metalworker by training, Parkes was to turn his sharp intelligence towards a variety of old and new materials in the burgeoning industrial world of mid-19th-century Britain. His life was an active one \u2013 he was granted over 66\u00a0patents. He also found time to father 17 children with two wives, his second wife being the friend of his eldest daughter.", "Parkes had a varied and successful career in metallurgy, working on a number of processes, including the desilverising of lead \u2013 known as the Parkes process.

Indeed Bessemer topped the list of the investors in the Parkesine Company set up in 1866, although the company failed in 1868 \u2013 probably because of issues associated with quality and flammability. Parkes, though a prolific inventor, was no businessman. We might see him as a victim of an agile but perhaps too busy mind, and of a strong moral conscience. When he developed a potentially lucrative explosive powder, he refused to sell it to the British, French or Russian governments.", "In a letter written on 7 March 1881, Parkes rather plaintively remarked that: \u2018In answer to the American Inquiry \u201cWho Invented Celluloid\u201d \u2026 I do wish the World to know who the inventor really was, for it is a poor reward after all I have done to be denied the merit of the invention.\u2019", "Celluloid, the direct descendant of Parkesine, became a great commercial success, used to make a range of decorative goods, often imitating the more expensive ivory, tortoiseshell and mother-of-pearl. Perhaps its most enduring legacy was its application in cinematic film. Parkes had foreseen the use of Parkesine film as a replacement for glass photographic negatives as early as 1856.

But as the Soviet probes journeyed down through the Venusian atmosphere it became clear that this planet \u2013 named after the Roman goddess of love \u2013 was a supremely hostile world.

Venera 5 and 6 were launched on 5 and 19 January 1969, both arriving at Venus four months later.", "There had not been time to strengthen these spacecraft against the unforgiving atmosphere, so instead the mission designers modified their parachutes so that they would descend faster and reach lower altitudes, sending back new data before their inevitable destruction.", "Launched on 17 August 1970, Venera 7 made it intact to the surface of Venus on 15 December 1970 \u2013 the first probe ever to soft land on another planet.

The camera could see clearly to the horizon \u2013 there was no dust in the atmosphere, but its thickness refracted the light, playing tricks and making the horizon appear nearer than it actually was. The clouds were high \u2013 about 50 km overhead.", "The Soviet Union now had a winning spacecraft design that could withstand the worst that Venus could do. More missions followed, but then in the early 1980s, the designers started making plans for the most challenging interplanetary mission ever attempted.", "Scientists around the world were keen to send spacecraft to Halley\u2019s Comet, which was returning to \u2018our\u2019 part of the Solar System on its 75-year orbit of the Sun.

They arrived at Venus in June 1985.", "Each released a descent probe into the Venusian atmosphere. Part of it released a lander that parachuted down to the surface while the other part deployed a balloon, with a package of scientific instruments suspended underneath that first dropped and then rose through the atmosphere to be carried around the planet by winds blowing at well over 200 miles per hour.", "Meanwhile, the main part of each Vega spacecraft continued on past Venus, using the planet\u2019s gravity to slingshot itself towards an encounter with Halley.", "A little under a year later both arrived a few million kilometers distant from the comet. Both were battered and damaged by its dust, but their instruments and cameras returned plenty of information on the ancient, icy and primordial heavenly body.", "A golden age of Russian planetary exploration had come to an end.", "Russia plans to return to Venus, but meanwhile, its Vega spacecraft, their instruments long dead, continue to patrol the outer reaches of the Solar System, relics of the nation\u2019s pioneering days of space exploration."]},

There was so much going on and it was all immensely interesting. Working in the Collections Office, I was opened to the opportunity to do a wide variety of tasks and experiences: Going to interesting meetings, contributing to website creations, visiting Blythe House, and doing things that actually made a difference around the museum.", "I\u2019m quite a shy person. Usually, I find it very difficult to talk to people I don\u2019t know or have never met and I become extremely passive. Working at the museum, however, with everyone being so friendly, I felt very comfortable in the work place very quickly. I was even shocked at myself\u00a0at how I could so easily talk to people I had only just met and I think that being so warmly welcomed was a big contribution to that.", "There were some stressful bits of work; guiding a group of people from one place to another, although a simple job, it had to be executed smoothly, and being a naturally worried person, it was quite a big thing for me to do. None the less, it was completed successfully so I was rather proud of my self. This was, after all, work experience, and it was good for me to see some of the less relaxed parts of a full time job.", "But, of course, this experience couldn\u2019t be complete without a tour of Blythe House, a store for objects, and a wind down with a milkshake, IMAX film and Learning show. I enjoyed working at the museum and will undoubtedly miss my time here. But, I will leave with a fully enriching experience and I cannot thank everyone who made it such a nice time for me, enough.", "Join us soon for a second blog post by Emily on her favourite art piece at the Science Museum.", "", ""]},

That\u2019s over \u00a316m in today\u2019s money!\u00a0This money was put to good use, and following on from the phenomenal success of the Great Exhibition part of the profit was used to set up the South Kensington Museum (pictured below).", "This museum housed art and science objects in new buildings on a road named after the success of 1851 \u2013 Exhibition Road. The collections grew so large that by 1893 both the science and arts collections had their own directors, with the Science Museum officially opening in 1909.", "It\u2019s amazing to think that an exhibition visited by millions of people more than a century and a half ago is part of the reason the museum is here today.

But the question, and subsequent conversation, made me realise how little many people know about the subject, despite its profound impact on modern life and the way we think about the universe.", "This year is the centenary of the publication of one of the theories that laid the foundation for our understanding of matter in terms of quanta \u2013 packets of energy. According to quantum mechanics, light is not a wave, but lump of energy called photons. Max Planck came up with the idea at the end of the 19th Century, though he considered his light \u2018quanta\u2019 a useful model, rather than reality.", "One hundred years ago, in 1913, the young Danish researcher Niels Bohr sent a paper to the Philosophical Magazine in London that used these quanta to solve a serious problem with theories about the atom.\u00a0At the time, scientists thought the atom was like a solar systems; electrons orbit a nucleus of protons and neutrons. But anything that moves in a circle gradually slowly radiates energy, and so moves closer to the centre of orbit. Eventually, electrons should fall into the nucleus of the atom.", "But they blatantly don\u2019t, otherwise everything in the Universe would collapse, and we wouldn\u2019t exist. Bohr proposed that electrons could only sit in discrete orbits or distances from the nucleus \u2013 and therefore when electrons change orbit transitions between orbits emit only emit energy in discrete packets (quanta), not gradually. The electrons therefore stay put in their orbits, and don\u2019t fall into the nucleus of the atom.", "Bohr was the first to show that packets of energy could successfully explain and predict the behaviour of atoms, the stuff that makes up you and me. His results were only approximately correct, but a big improvement of previous theories.", "Generations of scientists have built on Bohr\u2019s insight to understand and create the modern world. When my friend asked whether quantum physics worked, I pointed at his laptop. Computers, nanotechnology, and the Large Hadron Collider owe their existence to the physics that began with Bohr\u2019s generation.", "Bohr\u2019s original papers are clear and comprehensible, a beautiful read for physicists. The mathematics involves nothing more difficult than multiplication and division, yet the philosophical implications are immense. Max Planck never fully accepted quantum physics; neither did Albert Einstein, despite winning a Nobel Prize for his work on the subject.", "Bohr also won a Nobel Prize for his quantum theory, but his work did not stop. He founded the Niels Bohr Institute, a centre of theoretical physics in Copenhagen, worked on the Manhattan Project developing the atomic bomb, and continued to make contributions to quantum mechanics.", "And he has a lovely link to the exhibition I\u2019m currently working on, about the Large Hadron Collider. Bohr was influential in the founding of CERN, the Geneva laboratory that is home to the LHC.

The first few hours were spent photographing the exteriors of buildings to act as backdrops in the exhibition. There was a particular warehouse door, in varying shades of rust and faded blue, that really caught the team\u2019s attention. It will take me a while to forget the image of the design team gathered around it while Finn took high-res shots with his \u00a320k camera. That\u2019s designers for you I suppose.", "Then we ventured into the star of the show, the enigmatic Building 2, a 1970s block that houses a large number of institute offices. Along its long beige corridors you find offices of universities from all over the world, including the room where Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web and my own home-away-from-home, the Cambridge LHCb office. We spent a happy afternoon photographing the office doors, each with their own personal details that do more than any museum text panel could in getting across just how international a place CERN is. We owe a particular debt of thanks to a PhD student from Bristol, in on a holiday to work on her thesis, who obligingly allowed us barge into her office to take photographs.", "Meanwhile our sound designer was busily recording the soundscape of CERN from the clanging of doors and the echo of footsteps on lino to the hum of electrical equipment. Once we had recorded enough material to rebuild Building 2 in its entirety should any calamity befall it, we made a brisk trip around nearby parts of the lab, taking in the main auditorium where the discovery of the Higgs boson was announced to the world, and a series of labs and warehouses including the LEIR accelerator ring, the machine responsible producing beams of lead ions for our muse, the Large Hadron Collider.", "But after all that, we had only scratched the surface of the sprawling laboratory.

But working at the Science Museum is the complete opposite, I\u2019ve learnt so many skills and I really enjoy helping the visitors; the best part is interacting with the children and encouraging them to have fun while they learn something new. The environment is full of surprises and there are a range of different tasks to keep me busy, so no two days are the same.

I feel proud to say that I work at the Museum and I love what I do. The environment at the Museum is so friendly and you learn so much without even realising. The Explainer department is so exciting and inviting; you can make friends with everyone and not feel left out. When I complete this apprenticeship I would love to stay on as an Explainer and start to do shows.

When I first started I was scared of the Explainers, however, as time went on I realised they aren\u2019t scary and I began to have conversations with them.", "I have recently performed demos to the Explainers at a meeting. One of these demos included using plastic cups and an air-zuka (the air-zuka looks like a plastic tube and handle with a plastic bag on the end). I had to pull back the bag and let go, shooting air out in a spiral vortex which knocked down the cups, in my case it knocked down 3 cups out of the 7. Performing the demos was one of the scariest things I have ever done because I was performing demos to the performers and it took a lot of practice and support to build up the courage to perform them. But once I started performing them to the Explainers, I started to feel calmer and they began to laugh because of the humour I had added. At the end of the demos, all the Explainers gave me compliments and said I did well. I now feel like part of the team and enjoy working with them. I have also learned some Makaton during my time at the Museum, which is a language to help communicate with those with special needs.

Desperate for cures, government proposed that one penny per working person per year should be taken from their national insurance tax and put into tuberculosis treatment and research. We would call it ring fenced funding today. By 1913 it was recommended that this research should be extended to all diseases. An advisory council and executive committee was convened to oversee this research and administer funds \u2014 and thus it was that the MRC was established.", "And what a 100 years it has been.

However, this shift in how we treat disease does not come without its controversy.", "The Drug Castle itself is a reminder of this as it was created to feature in a poster campaign by the East London Health Project in 1978. This campaign aimed to raise questions about whether pharmaceutical companies were more interested in making money or making their medicines available to all.

In the picture you can see the original part of the call box \u2013 the small yellow box at the front that he would have sat behind, probably under an umbrella. As the business grew so too did his call box until eventually it was big enough to stand in, and even had its own electricity supply.

Original nails also had to be removed where they were sticking out from the timbers as they were usually bent and corroded and would get in the way of the reassembly, as well posing as a safety hazard to the team. We used modern fixings in the re-build instead, as this involved putting the timbers under less stress and also means in the future it will be obvious which bits are the original object, and which bits we added. Anything we added to the object has been carefully recorded.", "Some timbers had to be repaired for the structural integrity of the object; in these cases the damage had been caused entirely through the deconstruction process. \u00a0The work included \u2018consolidating\u2019 the feet of the object to prevent any of the original wood being lost and to protect them during transport to the gallery. Working on the roof was quite challenging, and we built a\u00a0special support so that it could be worked on upside-down. We haven\u2019t put the roof back on yet because it\u2019ll be easier to transport it back to London in two pieces ready for the display.", "Keep your eyes peeled for future posts about how we\u2019re working with Cameroonians based in London to decide together how the various objects we brought back should be displayed."]},

However, with few telegrams in our collection, the challenge was set to identify examples which show the range of messages sent over the telegram\u2019s long history, and which could be displayed in the new gallery. To overcome this, we invited members of the public to share their telegrams and the stories behind them with us.", "To ensure that we collected stories from across the UK, we invited partner museums to work with us, allowing them to also acquire telegrams for their own collections, and to make new connections within their local communities. To help with the search, each museum recruited community collector volunteers who spread the word, identified potential donors and organised collecting days at their local museums. These events took place throughout July, with dozens of fantastic telegrams being collected. Digital scans of these telegrams, along with supporting images and the stories behind the messages will go on display in Information Age , as well as few physical paper telegrams too.", "The project has been a great trial for working with volunteers to collect material, and to ensure that the Museum reaches beyond its London base.

Von Braun had wanted to defect to the Americans but later told Leonov that he would have worked for the Soviets too, claiming he wanted to use rocketry for exploration, not murder. \u2018He was very sincere, very frank,\u2019 said Leonov, \u2018though you may chose not to believe his words because these were weapons, after all.\u2019", "The USSR captured a number of V-2s , including one from the marshes of Peenem\u00fcnde, and German staff. This paved the way for the manufacture of a Soviet duplicate, the R-1. By August 1957, a descendant, the R-7, was capable of launching a satellite into orbit.", "The space age dawned with the launch of Sputnik 1, which was \u2018just a sphere with a transmitter\u2026beep beep, beep beep,\u2019 said Leonov. \u2018That was sufficient for people to get very excited, now we are in an era where there is an artificial object floating in space. This was only the beginning.\u2019", "The Soviet Union followed Sputnik by launching the first animal, man and woman into orbit in just six years, feats that will be recorded by the Science Museum\u2019s Cosmonauts exhibition with objects ranging from a dog ejector seat from a sub-orbital rocket to a model of Vostok 1 (Russian for \u2018East\u2019), which carried Yuri Gagarin into space, and Valentina Tereshkova\u2019s Vostok-6 descent module.", "After chalking the outline of a Vostok, Leonov moved on to the Voskhod (Russian for \u201csunrise\u201d), which he said was part of a lunar programme that began with a directive in 1962 and was officially sanctioned by the Politburo two years later.", "Voskhod 1 launched on October 12, 1964. Even though there was not enough room to wear space suits, or time to develop a launch escape system, it successfully took the first three-man crew into orbit years before the US Apollo\u2019s three-man crews.", "Voskhod 2 featured more powerful propulsion, TV and had been adapted to allow Leonov to carry out the first ever spacewalk. The spacecraft carried a \u2018genius invention\u2019,\u00a0he said, an airlock that could be inflated through which a cosmonaut could step into open space. \u2018That was me,\u2019 said Leonov.", "Earlier, Korolev had told him, \u2018as a sailor should know how to swim in open ocean, so a cosmonaut should be able to swim in space.\u2019", "But Leonov\u2019s ill-fated mission almost did not take place. An earlier automated unmanned test flight \u2013\u00a0Voskhod 3KD \u2013 had been destroyed after ground controllers sent a sequence of commands that accidentally set off a self-destruct mechanism designed to prevent the craft ending up in enemy hands.", "At a meeting in a hotel, Korolev told Leonov he hoped to adapt his Voskhod 2 to complete the unmanned mission to test the airlock and spacesuit.\u00a0\u2018We were set dead against it,\u2019 said Leonov. He protested to The Chief Designer: \u2018We have personally worked through 3000 emergency scenarios\u2019, which was greeted, understandably, with scepticism. \u2018Yeah, of course you did,\u2019 said Korolev. \u2018You are sure to come across the three thousand and first. And, of course, Leonov \u2018would know what to do.\u2019", "Leonov admitted to the audience that Korolev\u2019s cynicism was well placed. To carry out his spacewalk above the Black Sea, on 18 March 1965, he and his crewmate Pavel Belyayev came across the \u2018three thousandth and second and third and fifth and sixth\u2026all of them were not described in any instructions before.\u2019", "As Leonov \u2018stepped into the abyss\u2019, he was struck by the sound of his own breathing, his heartbeat and a sense of the universe \u2018being limitless in time and space\u2019. Given that in the darkness the temperatures plunged to minus 140 deg C and in sunlight rose to 150 deg C his suit was \u2018a stroke of genius\u2019 for the way it kept him at a comfortable 20 deg C.", "But eight minutes into the spacewalk, he felt that his gloves had expanded so much that he could no longer feel them with his fingers any more. His legs started to shake. Leonov\u2019s spacesuit had by now ballooned in space to an alarming degree. \u2018I started feverishly thinking of what I was going to do to re-enter the spacecraft\u2019.", "First he had to coil his tether. Every 50 cm dangled a 2.5 cm diameter ring, which he was supposed to hook.\u2019 But he had \u2018no support\u2019 and was hanging on by one hand. \u2018It was very hard.\u2019", "He disobeyed the orders of Korolev \u2013 there was no time to wait for a committee to be assembled to deliberate on his predicament \u2013 and opened a valve to bleed of some of the suit\u2019s pressure, risking the bends by lowering the pressure beyond the safety limit.", "On his back Leonov wore \u2018metal tanks with ninety minutes\u2019 worth of oxygen\u2019\u00a0 but it was clear from his talk that he remained concerned he had not left enough time for the nitrogen from the oxygen/nitrogen mix inside Voskhod to be purged from his blood. \u2018There was a danger of nitrogen boiling in my blood and I was feeling this needling sensation in my fingers but I had no choice.\u2019 Fortunately, \u2018The feeling went away.\u2019", "Instead of entering legs first, as he had trained to do, Leonov went in head first, requiring \u2018an awful amount of energy\u2019 to turn around in the confines of the 1.2 m diameter airlock (he measured 1.9 m in his spacesuit). His core body temperature soared by 1.8 \u00b0C as he contorted himself. \u2018That was the most stressful moment.\u2019 Overall, the spacewalk lasted 12 minutes. By that time, Soviet state radio and television had stopped their live broadcasts.", "The mission\u2019s problems were far from over. The descent module\u2019s hatch failed to reseal properly, leading to a slow leak. The craft\u2019s automated systems flooded the craft with oxygen, raising the risk of fire of the kind seen in the Apollo 1 tragedy .", "When they turned on their automatic descent systems, the spacecraft did not stop rotating. \u2018It was difficult and dangerous to stop.\u2019 Their automatic guidance system had malfunctioned. They asked Korolev for permission to conduct a manual descent, which the craft was not designed to do. \u2018It was very similar to driving a car looking out the window from the side.\u2019 From an \u2018ancient Soviet radio station\u2019 in Antarctica came permission, along with a note of caution: \u2018Be careful.\u2019", "\u2018You know what, let us land in the Red Square, it would be so jolly funny,\u2019 remarked Leonov, who was the mission navigator. Belyayev, commander, replied that they would \u2018clip all the stars in the Kremlin so I don\u2019t think we should do it\u2019. Eventually, Voskhod 2 ended up far from the primary landing zone on the steppes of Kazakhstan, in polar forests \u2013 taiga \u2013 around 180 kilometres from Perm in Siberia. \u2018To us, the trees of 30-40 m looked like a manicured lawn.\u2019 Leonov transmitted a call sign with a manual telegraph system \u2013 \u2018everything is in order\u2019 \u2013 but it was greeted by silence.", "A gust of cold air entered when they opened the hatch. Belyayev jumped out and ended up neck deep in snow. Leonov was sloshing around knee deep in water in his spacesuit. They stripped in the cold and Leonov wrung out his underwear. \u2018Can you imagine this picture \u2013 a spacecraft, the taiga, and naked chaps standing next to each other?\u2019", "The next day, \u2018comrades on skis\u2019 arrived and, after another night and a nine kilometre ski trip, they were picked up by helicopter.", "The Soviets had originally planned to orbit the moon in 1967 and had two parallel lunar programmes, one manned and one unmanned (This was a mistake, Leonov conceded). On his blackboard, Leonov drew a Soyuz (Russian for \u2018Union\u2019) 7K-L1 \u2018Zond\u2019 (\u2018probe\u2019) spacecraft that was designed to circle the Moon and described how he had even studied the sky in Somalia to decide which stars to use for lunar navigation. \u2018Everything was ready.\u2019", "Leonov was once the Soviet cosmonaut thought most likely to become the first human on the Moon. But the Soviet lunar programme was starved of resources compared with America\u2019s Apollo programme, the Soviet manned moon-flyby missions lost political momentum and Korolev died in 1966 (\u2018those who took his place decided this was too risky\u2019). One could sense his frustration when he declared: \u2018Six spacecraft orbited the moon without a man on board.\u2019", "However, Science Museum visitors will be able to inspect the monumental five metre LK-3 lunar lander, the finest example of its kind, which was designed to take a single cosmonaut to the Moon\u2019s surface.", "Leonov counted himself lucky to be part of the Apollo Soyuz mission, when \u2018the cold war could become a hot war at any moment.\u2019 Conducted in July 1975, it was the first joint US\u2013Soviet space flight, and the last flight of an Apollo spacecraft. The mission was a symbol of superpower d\u00e9tente. \u2018Every day we spoke on Good Morning America,\u2019 said Leonov. He groaned with mock horror, \u2018awwww\u2019, acting out the apoplexy of small-town America at the thought of a cosmonaut orbiting overhead.", "Leonov went on to talk about how singer Sarah Brightman had cancelled her trip to the International Space Station, mention the Soviet Buran shuttle, which was delayed by discussions about pilots and automated control (the latter won but \u2018we lost three years, launched only one and then nobody commissioned it\u2019) and discussions to allow China to dock with the ISS.", "He also discussed the greatest threat to humanity, that of asteroid impacts (now marked by Asteroid Day ), which demanded the best of human ingenuity and technology in response.\u00a0In 2008 the Association of Space Explorer\u2019s Committee on Near-Earth Objects and its international Panel on Asteroid Threat Mitigation gave recommendations to the United Nations. \u2018So far we have not heard back from them. I think they are waiting for the asteroid to hit them\u2019.", "Leonov had before him in the Science Museum IMAX an audience that ranged from amateur space enthusiasts to rock legends Brian May and Rick Wakeman , and the world\u2019s best known scientist, Professor Stephen Hawking, who had recently given a highly publicised tour of the Science Museum . Leonov described him as \u2018amazingly courageous\u2019.", "Sitting in the front row of the IMAX was the UK\u2019s first astronaut, Helen Sharman , whose Sokol space suit will be shown in Cosmonauts. Leonov described how he had a \u2018very moving\u2019 reunion in the museum with \u2018little Helen.\u2019 \u2018The best pupil I have ever had,\u2019 said Leonov.", "Sharman had been selected to travel into space on 25 November 1989 ahead of nearly 13,000 other applicants. She blasted off in 1991. Leonov encouraged her to stand, and the audience showed their appreciation with a round of applause. \u2018She had a special energy, special intellect. You should be proud of this person.\u2019", "At the end of the event, Leonov was presented an honorary fellowship of the Science Museum by Hawking and the Chairman of the Board of Trustees, Dame Mary Archer. In return, Leonov, who had dined with Hawking earlier that day, presented the Cambridge cosmologist with a portrait he had sketched after lunch. \u2018Stephen smiled, hooray,\u2019 a delighted Leonov told the audience, who were also addressed by Alistair Scott, President of the British Interplanetary Society, and astronomer Garik Israelian of the Starmus Festival.", "At a celebratory dinner in the museum that night, Leonov gave a speech in Russian (he preferred his mother tongue because, as he cheerfully recounted, he once ended a speech given in English by wishing his audience \u2018sex for life\u2019 rather than \u2018a successful life.\u2019) Leonov also alluded to the prevailing American bias in museum accounts of space history. He praised the Science Museum for containing the \u2018wisdom of the world\u2019 that would be an \u2018inspiration and lesson for future generations.\u2019", "Roger Highfield, Director of External Affairs, spent a day with the pioneering cosmonaut for the launch of Cosmonauts: Birth of the Space Age ."]},

Like a quadrant , it would have been used for making astronomical observations and measurements. But whereas quadrants can only measure angles through a span of 90\u00b0, this instrument has a very unusual arc of 142\u00b0.

The tube was heated to around 200\u00b0C to separate the different chemical components carried in the hydrogen gas, doing away with heavy pumps.", "He demonstrated the device to \u2018rocket scientists\u2019 in Pasadena but at one point the flow of hydrogen stopped, and a sceptical engineer remarked that the tube must be blocked.", "It turned out that the tube was not blocked, the separator did indeed work and, when Lovelock proved this, the gaggle of Nasa scientists and engineers around him \u2018gave a great cheer\u2026here\u2019s something that really works and does magic\u2019, Lovelock recalls in his interview.", "It was while working at NASA that Lovelock began to consider whether life could be detected on a planet simply by examining the planet\u2019s atmosphere.

At the end of the day, my mother collected us all.\u201d", "Dame Mary Archer, Chair of the Science Museum Group Board of Trustees, said:\u00a0\u201cWhile Stephen\u2019s work transcended space and time, he was very much a man of this age: he was a wonderful science populariser as well as a very great theoretical physicist.\u201d", "Hawking made an enduring impact on popular culture, from his international bestseller, A Brief History of Time, to his appearances in shows as diverse as Star Trek, the Simpsons and The Big Bang Theory, and his bets with other physicists, often unsuccessful: in 2012 he lost a $100 bet he made against the discovery of the Higgs Boson, but graciously said that Peter Higgs deserved the Nobel prize.", "During his research career, at the University of Cambridge\u2019s Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, Hawking saw his field of cosmology rise from a niche subject in the 1960s to being perhaps the most compelling of all the sciences \u2013 not least thanks to his own inspirational contribution.", "One of Hawking\u2019s overarching goals has been to take general relativity ( Einstein\u2019s law of gravity ), which controls the large scale structure of the universe, and blend it with quantum theory, which rules the world of atoms, molecules and the very small, to produce a grand theory of everything, known as quantum gravity.", "Hawking first caught the attention of his peers in the late 1960s, working with Roger Penrose on how general relativity sometimes breaks down, resulting in something called a singularity.\u00a0In the case of a collapsing over-massive star, densities would become infinite in a singularity \u2013 giving us the essence of what we now refer to as a \u201cblack hole\u201d.", "They showed that such singularities must occur inside black holes \u2013 and, most probably, at the start of the universe. This idea implies that singularities mark the beginning and end of space and time, which was created during the Big Bang and breaks down within black holes.", "In his most famous work, Hawking raised the intriguing possibility that black holes are not as black as once thought. The reason is down to one strange consequence of quantum theory: empty space isn\u2019t empty at all: pairs of particles are constantly popping into and out of existence. If they appear on the border of event horizon \u2013 the point of no return from the gravity well of a black hole, as described by general relativity \u2013 they may find themselves on different sides, with one sucked in, and the other becoming part of \u201cHawking radiation\u201d.", "If the paradoxical glow of Hawking radiation had been detected from a black hole during his lifetime, Hawking would have won the Nobel prize.", "The same mathematics can also be applied to the \u2018echo of the Big Bang\u2019 which took place 13.7 billion years ago, the splash of residual microwaves that still warm today\u2019s universe, \u00a0and to the way in which a soup of ultra-hot matter crystallised to form the visible universe.", "In spring 1982, Hawking made a radical proposal: that fluctuations in the cosmic background radiation could be traced back to Hawking radiation, as the tiny seeds around which the large scale structure of the universe coalesced.", "That summer, this \u201cfluctuation theory\u201d was developed at a workshop organised by Hawking and his colleague Gary Gibbons. Remarkably, their efforts \u2013 and those of two Russians who came up with the same result independently \u2013 predicted these fluctuations in the fabric of the cosmos a decade before a purpose-built satellite called COBE observed them in the heavens.", "With James Hartle, Hawking also developed in the early 1980s the \u201cno-boundary\u201d idea, whereby the singularity of the Big Bang is replaced by the history of the universe as a sphere, like our own Earth, where time corresponds to latitude, starting with zero at the North Pole and progressing southward. When asked what happened before the Big Bang, Hawking said it was like asking what was north of the North Pole \u2014 it was not any place, or any time.", "I first met Hawking in Berkeley, California, when he was giving a lecture to promote A Brief History of Time. He was greeted like a rock star of science, with main and satellite venues groaning with people who found his personal story inspirational, transforming from a lazy student into the world\u2019s best known scientist who, as a result of motor neurone disease, has only the use of a few muscles.", "It was in 1963, then a bright, ambitious, 21-year-old PhD student at Cambridge, that Hawking was told that he had a type of motor neurone disease (today we know it as an unusual form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) and was given about two years to live. His illness was degenerative: it would attack the nerves that controlled his muscles, affecting first his body, then eventually his mood, senses and thinking.", "Personally and professionally, Hawking has travelled light years since that shattering diagnosis. He has never complained, or shown any signs of self-pity: he initially coped, he says, by listening to Wagner. \u201cReports in magazine articles that I drank heavily are an exaggeration.\u201d", "What gave him something to live for was meeting Jane Wilde, a languages student, whom he married in 1965. The advance of his disease slowed, and he threw himself into his research, turning from a brilliant but lazy student into a workaholic.", "But as Hawking\u2019s career was advancing, so was his disease. In 1983, the BBC\u2019s Horizon showed how his speech had become slurred and hard to decipher. Soon, a tracheotomy left him unable to speak at all: the only way he could communicate was by raising his eyebrows to select letters as they were held up on cards.", "By 1988 Hawking was using the speech synthesiser that has since given him his trademark American accent. For the past few years, he has operated the device by twitching a cheek muscle \u2013 but even when I interviewed him in front of an audience 15 or so years ago, it would take him minutes to give prepared answers.

And yet in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, this kit was one of many distributed along the River Thames to be used to revive people who had recently drowned. It includes a set of bellows, a fumigator, an ivory syringe, and a variety of tubes and nozzles that could be inserted into various\u2026bodily orifices.", "This resuscitation kit embodies many of the ideas that were being debated at the time, some of which may be more familiar than others. A great deal of thought was put into different ways water could be expelled and the lungs inflated. Mouth-to-mouth was a recognised technique but fears over the spread of contagion meant that it was generally avoided (it was only from 1959 that it became commonly used).", "A pair of bellows, on the other hand, seemed to be a healthier alternative and so they were used to inflate the lungs with \u2018atmospheric air\u2019.", "However, this was not all the bellows could be used for. Attached to the fumigator, the bellows could also be used to deliver a tobacco smoke \u2018clyster\u2019 or enema, quite literally blowing smoke up the patient\u2019s rectum.", "At the time, many medical treatments were based on the theory of the four humours, which suggested that good health was ensured by balancing the bodily fluids: blood, phlegm, black bile and yellow bile.", "Those who had apparently drowned were thought to suffer from an excess of wet phlegm and cold black bile. Introducing warm and dry substances into the body was therefore considered key to resuscitation, leading physicians to use different \u2018stimuli\u2019 to encourage the heart to resume beating.", "Medicinal ingredients could be administered orally, using the ivory syringe also included in the kit, but tobacco smoke clyster pipes were a particularly popular treatment. The warm, dry vapours produced by burning tobacco and nicotine were thought to encourage the lungs and heart back into action, particularly when directed into the bowels through the rectum. With the occasional smouldering ember accompanying this smoky enema, perhaps \u2018stimulating\u2019 is a bit of an understatement.", "You may wince or even laugh at what seems to be an absurd idea, given what we know today. However, at the time, this kit was part of an innovative movement that began to challenge the boundaries of what was considered possible when reviving the apparently dead.", "The idea of resuscitation itself was not new, and stories of people apparently dead being restored to life repeatedly emerged throughout the last couple of millennia, the earliest of which include the biblical tales of the prophets Elijah and Elisha. However, these stories were often seen as miracles or phenomena, and it was only from the mid-eighteenth century that physicians, surgeons and apothecaries attempted to push resuscitation into the medical mainstream, inspiring a flurry of research and experimentation.", "In cities across Europe, societies dedicated to the rescue and revival of the apparently drowned sprung into existence, starting with Amsterdam in 1767. Reports of their successes later reached England, and in 1774, William Hawes (an apothecary) and Thomas Cogan (a physician) founded the \u2018Society for the Recovery of Persons Apparently Drowned\u2019.", "Later becoming the Royal Humane Society, this initial group of thirty-four volunteers purchased lifeboats and equipment for rescuing the drowning, published manuals for reviving these \u2018unfortunates\u2019, and created receiving houses where the drowned could recover. They also created these resuscitation kits and deposited them along the Thames, making sure the necessary equipment was available and portable in the case of a sudden emergency.", "The below paintings were commissioned by the Royal Humane Society. The first depicts a man being rescued from a river, and the second reveals the same man alive and well, having been resuscitated by William Hawes and John Coakley Lettsom (another member of the Society). They were used to advertise the good works of the Society at public dinners, transforming skepticism into generous donations.", "It will probably relieve swimmers across Europe that first aid has moved on considerably since this kit was created, and so worry not \u2013 it is extremely unlikely that you will ever be treated with this smoky enema.", "As early as the 1780s, doubts were being voiced about the effectiveness of tobacco smoke. Later, in 1811, Benjamin Brodie\u2019s experiments on animals revealed that nicotine was toxic, meaning that the days of tobacco enemas were numbered. Similarly, French physician, Leroy d\u2019Etoiles, discovered that artificial respiration using the bellows could in fact rupture the alveoli of the lungs in 1829, and so I wouldn\u2019t recommend adding a set to your personal first aid kit.", "No matter how outdated and bizarre this kit may seem, however, the intent behind their creation set the ball rolling, leading to new (and more effective) techniques. \u00a0After all, humane societies encouraged us to seriously challenge what was considered possible, and to think up new solutions to the problem of bringing people back from the brink of death.", "You can see the resuscitation kit on display in Medicine: The Wellcome Galleries ."]},

In this mess he stumbled on a kind of fingerprint, one which showed not only which parts of Wilson\u2019s DNA came from her mother and which from her father, but also the unique genetic code that she possessed, one that was shared by no other human being on the planet.", "In that Eureka moment, the science of DNA fingerprinting was born.", "Sir Alec and his technician made a list of all the possible applications of genetic fingerprinting \u2013 but it was his wife, Sue, who spotted the potential for resolving immigration disputes, which in fact proved to be the first application.", "Soon after his discovery, Sir Alec was asked to help confirm the identity of a boy whose family was originally from Ghana. DNA results proved that the boy was indeed a close relation of people already in the UK.\u00a0The results were so conclusive that the Home Office, after being briefed by the professor, agreed to drop the case and the boy was allowed to stay in the country, to his mother\u2019s immense relief. \u201cOf all the cases,\u201d he recalls, \u201cthis is the one that means most to me.\u2019\u2019", "Sir Alec is the first to admit that he never realised just how useful his work would turn out to be: in resolving paternity issues, for example, in studies of wildlife populations and, of course, in many criminal investigations (DNA fingerprinting was first used by police to identify the rapist and killer of two teenage girls murdered in Narborough, Leicestershire, in 1983 and in 1986 respectively).", "Similar methods were used to establish the identity of the \u2018Angel of Death\u2019 Josef Mengele (using bone from the Nazi doctor\u2019s exhumed skeleton), and to identify the remains of Tsar Nicholas II and his family \u2013 in the course of which the Duke of Edinburgh gave a blood sample.", "Sir Alec told the University recently : \u201cThe discovery of DNA fingerprinting was a glorious accident. It was best summarised in a school project that a grandson of mine did years ago: \u2018DNA fingerprinting was discovered by my granddad when he was messing about in the lab\u2019. Actually, you can\u2019t describe it better than that \u2013 that is exactly what we were doing.\u201d", "Sir Alec has long been concerned about the world\u2019s DNA databases.

When his daughter was twelve, he received an unwelcome marriage proposal from the powerful and very elderly Count d\u2019Amerval.", "With threats of losing his job, Jacque successfully blocked the proposal by means of arranging another, with a younger, more suitable bachelor \u2013 his colleague, Antoine Lavoisier.", "Despite the contrived nature of their marriage, Paulze and Lavoisier were well matched. Lavoisier was a chemist, and Paulze immediately took a keen interest in his work, determined to learn more about the field and join her husband in the laboratory.", "Paulze received formal training in chemistry from Lavoisier\u2019s colleagues and she also studied drawing under the famed French artist, Jacques Louis David. Later, Paulze commissioned a double portrait of her and Lavoisier, which the above engraving is based on.", "Such was her talent for drawing, that she produced the thirteen copperplate illustrations for Lavoisier\u2019s seminar work, Trait\u00e9 \u00c9l\u00e9mentaire de Chimie (1789), which laid the foundations of modern chemistry and the chemical elements as we know them now.

Paulze can be seen note-taking.", "The scientific interpretation of this experiment and the apparatus, which you can see varies slightly from the original illustration, has confounded historians.", "But the general project of this series of experiments was to measure and understand the roles of oxygen and carbon dioxide \u2013 gases that had been recently discovered \u2013 in respiration.", "These respiration experiments were carried out at the Lavoisiers\u2019 home laboratory at the Paris Arsenal. The Lavoisiers worked under a strict regime: 6.00 \u2013 9.00 and 19.00 \u2013 21.00 weekdays; and morning and lunch in the laboratory Saturdays, with theoretical discussions in the afternoon.", "Paulze played a vital role in the promotion of their work to the international scientific community, editing publications and keeping her husband Lavoisier abreast of the latest developments.", "Unlike Lavoisier, she mastered languages, translating key chemical works, such as those of British chemists Joseph Priestley and Henry Cavendish. Her annotations and comments speak to the depth of her chemical knowledge.", "For these reasons, she deserves a place alongside her husband for the successful dissemination of the oxygen theory of combustion (oxidation), which replaced the prevailing phlogiston theory , favoured by the Brits. It would form the basis of the modern classification of the chemical elements.", "The Lavoisiers\u2019 marriage did not have a happy ending. Due to his career with the Royal Tax Collectors, Lavoisier was not spared the fate of many of the aristocratic class during the Terrors of the French Revolution. He was guillotined in 1794, at the height of his scientific career.", "After her husband\u2019s execution, Paulze organised the publication of his final work, Memoires de Chimie .

You have made it so \u2026", "She did marry again, to another scientific luminary, the physicist Benjamin Thomson, better known as Count Rumford. But it did not last long, the couple divorcing after two months.", "Paulze described Rumford as \u2018the theoretical liberal\u2019 who in practice was a \u2018domestic tyrant\u2019. Rumford\u2019s own assessment was they were both too independent \u2013 he was used to getting his way and did not share the same sense of collaboration as Paulze\u2019s first husband.", "The pair did once have an amusing public feud. Paulze invited a large number of guests to their Paris home against the wishes of Rumford. Rumford responded by locking the gates and hiding the key. She ended up conversing with them through the gates, and in retaliation pouring boiling water on Rumford\u2019s prized flowers.", "Paulze\u2019s later years were occupied by charitable work, but her legacy as a chemist lives on through the work she achieved in her former life together with Lavoisier."]},

A demolition accident had almost totally destroyed it in 1949.", "Now the tube assumed a more fascinating form, like a fossil or a dinosaur bone as we delved into audio archeology. The story of the horn, researched in great detail by John, sparked an interest in me. Four years later in 2012, on being appointed as the Museum\u2019s first-ever sound artist-in-residence, I was given a wonderful opportunity to initiate its reconstruction.", "The exponential horn loudspeaker was designed in 1929 by the Museum\u2019s curator of\u00a0 \u2018Electrical Communication\u2019 R. P. G. Denman who also personally built a radio receiver to run in tandem with it.", "The purpose of this new sound system was to provide the public with demonstrations of the highest quality broadcast sound that was obtainable at the time. Denman saw it as setting a benchmark for audio quality, his aim was, in his words \u201cto provide a standard by which commercial apparatus could be judged\u201d.", "The horn measured 27 feet (8.23m) in length with a cross-section that curved exponentially from 1 1/16 inches (27mm) to a massive 7-foot-1-inch square (2.16m sq.) at the horn mouth.", "The science and theory of how horns propagate sound had only begun to emerge in the mid-1920s. It was found that a horn with an exponential shape was the most effective means of converting the sound energy from high pressure, low-velocity vibrations produced at the narrow end of the horn, into low pressure, high-velocity vibrations at its mouth then radiated into the outside air.", "However, in order to reproduce the lowest sounding frequencies, this type of horn has to be very long with a correspondingly large opening.", "Denman, an expert on loudspeakers, specially designed the horn in order to reproduce frequencies as low as 32Hz and up to 6kHz. This was achieved by loading it to one of the latest moving-coil driver units from the Western Electric Company (U.S.A.) namely the WE 555W, widely used in cinema sound systems of the time and now considered to be one of the greatest loudspeaker drivers ever made.", "From 1930 until the outbreak of WWII in 1939, the apparatus was demonstrated daily in the Museum\u2019s Radio Communication gallery. The giant horn mouth appeared on the wall above the entrance while the rest of it hung conspicuously in the adjacent Agricultural Implements gallery. It was built into the Museum\u2019s infrastructure and may be described as being its very first sound installation.", "Concerts broadcast on the BBC\u2019s London Regional programmes provided the content for the demonstrations. Critical reactions were positive and for audiences at the time, accustomed to limited bandwidth, interference, and distortion, the sound must have truly been a revelation. The Museum\u2019s Radio gallery became a popular lunchtime destination, where sandwiches were cheerfully munched while listening to the classics or Wurlitzer cinema organ music, the audio reproduced in glorious full-range. It left an indelible impression on those who heard it, including John Liffen\u2019s own uncle. Writing in the Audio Engineering Society Journal of April 1975, the audio experts Percy and Geoffrey L. Wilson opined that \u201cno superior loudspeaker has to date been demonstrated in Britain\u201d.", "Fast-forward to 2014 and we have an opportunity to hear the horn again.", "This is thanks in no small part to the magnificent efforts of the Museum\u2019s Workshops who undertook the reconstruction project with gusto. The missing 18-feet of the horn was rebuilt over an intense 8-month period following Denman\u2019s original specification, although fiber-glass was used in place of the original lead and tin alloy. Led by the Workshops manager Steve Long, the team has succeeded in recreating the single largest loudspeaker in Britain.", "The programme for the upcoming installation is a mixture of past and present, allowing us to listen to the horn in old and new ways.", "Archive material from the BBC will be heard alongside recent recordings made within the Science Museum. Resonance 104.4FM will be resident in the space, broadcasting live from the Museum, while lunchtime concerts via BBC Radio 3 will mirror the original demonstrations of the 1930s.", "A series of events, including live music, poetry and performance will also showcase new works for the horn created by a variety of artists, writers, and radio programme-makers.", "The title, \u201cIn Search of Perfect Sound\u201d, refers to Roderick Denman\u2019s quest for audio nirvana. Our modern ears may have become accustomed to high fidelity audio and surround sound, but the exponential horn, with its extraordinary sound presence and a distinct three-dimensional effect, still holds an immersive power of its own.", "I\u2019m very proud to have played a part in giving the Denman horn a new lease of life and to have witnessed its exponential metamorphosis, from that modest-looking metal tube, cocooned above all those filing cabinets.", "Aleks Kolkowski is a sound artist, violinist, and composer with a special interest in early sound recording and reproduction technology.", "The Exponential Horn: In Search of Perfect Sound opened at the Media Space Studio on 20 May 2014."]},

German proteomics pioneer Matthias Mann developed \u2018nano-electrospray\u2019 to extract proteins before interrogating and identifying them. To do this, the process vaporises the proteins after their extraction and charges them electrically. Once charged, the mass and identity of each protein can be inferred from how far it is deflected by a magnetic field. Thousands of proteins are simultaneously sequenced. By understanding the unique combination of proteins at work inside a patient, doctors can create personalised treatments.

Called an orrery or more correctly a tellurium, it is a demonstration device to show the motions of the Earth and Moon around the Sun.The one-hour change in our clocks from Greenwich Mean Time to British Summer Time and back can be really annoying and disruptive, and every year it sparks debate about whether Daylight Saving Time (DST) is worth the effort.", "DST was introduced during the First World War as an effort to save energy costs and resources by maximising useful daylight hours. Today, about 70 countries across the world practice DST, though many question its usefulness.

Initial grogginess can last a few days, but a 2007 study has shown that we never fully adjust to the switch. The main reason for this comes down to disrupted circadian rhythms. Coming from the Greek words \u2018circa\u2019, meaning about, and \u2018diem\u2019, meaning day, these rhythms regulate the times we sleep and eat, among a myriad of other bodily functions.

The study found that owls are affected more negatively by the springtime switch and larks have a harder time with the autumn switch. This all adds up to sleep disruption which can have some severe knock-on effects.", "Recent studies have shown that in the period immediately after changing clocks for DST, there are increased rates of heart attacks , workplace injuries and traffic accidents . Additionally, it is now known that disasters like the nuclear accident at Chernobyl and the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger have been linked to lack of sleep.

These studies have shown that the impacts of switching clocks for DST can exacerbate the problem for those who already have disrupted circadian rhythms.", "In addition to sleep deprivation, other health issues like Vitamin D deficiencies and mood disorders, like Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), can be traced to lack of sunlight during the winter months when many who work indoors don\u2019t see much daylight.", "With these findings in mind the EU recently proposed ending DST and staying on summer time year-round.

He wanted to study a two-dimensional sheet of carbon atoms that had long been posited by theorists and was predicted to have fascinating electronic properties, but had never been seen.", "After Da Jiang had reduced the graphite to dust, Geim\u2019s Ukrainian postdoc Oleg Shklyarevskii had a better idea: why not use Scotch tape, which physicists used to clean graphite?", "When they studied used tape, they found it was coated with ultrathin graphite: they knew that if they could get below 10 or so atomic layers it would become transparent, which raised Geim\u2019s hopes that graphene could be made.", "Here his fellow Nobelist Kostya Novoselov enters the story. Lo and behold, after around a year or so, they managed to isolate a hexagonal lattice of carbon atoms. The flat, parallel sheets of carbon atoms in the graphite of pencil lead could indeed be peeled apart to yield a single atomic layer with remarkable properties that promise myriad uses.", "Now for the first time, the University College London team has successfully modelled the way that graphene sheets cling together in graphite, revealing why sticky tape is so good at prising them apart.", "They are confident their model is correct because, as Sinclair explained, they have run their model in a supercomputer to simulate some remarkable experiments conducted in 2015 at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in Berkeley, California, where flakes of graphene skittering around on a graphite surface were studied using a special microscope with atomic resolution, called a Scanning Tunnelling Microscope .", "", "The microscope has a tip that can be used to push flakes of graphene around. They slide around like pucks in air hockey and, though the microscope can\u2019t see this in real time, it can reveal where they end up.", "In this way, they found that the 2D flakes only come to rest when the atoms in the graphene neatly line up with the atoms below, like stacking egg boxes, in what the chemists call a \u2018commensurate state\u2019. However, the lower the temperature, the further the flakes can travel because the underlying layer is smoother and less disturbed by jiggling caused by heat energy.", "Newton\u2019s laws can be used to predict these movements, even though the collisions between graphene scraps are \u2018weird\u2019: Dr Suter explained how they can \u2018slither over each other, it is bizarre.\u2019 Using a supercomputer and a virtual model of graphene, they got a good match with the observations made by the team in Berkeley.", "As a bonus, their computer model shows why sticky tape is so good for peeling them apart, explained Prof Coveney. Peeling a layer demands only 40 per cent of the energy of shearing, rather like peeling egg boxes apart with a vertical motion is easier than pulling one horizontally across another when they are neatly stacked.", "\u2018If shearing, then you get held up by this egg carton configuration. But if you peel, you can get them apart much more easily. The polymethyl methacrylate adhesive on traditional sticky tape is ideal for picking up the edge of the graphene sheet so it can be lifted and peeled.\u2019 he explained.", "\u2018The most remarkable thing here is that, despite the gazillions of publications there have been on graphene since its discovery, no one has bothered to ask how it interacts with itself over meaningful (atomic) length and time scales.\u2019 added Prof Coveney.", "\u2018The one reason above all others why the material is difficult to use is because it is hard to make,\u2019 he added. \u2018Even now, a dozen years after its discovery, companies have to apply sticky tape methods to pull it apart, as the laureates did to uncover it; hardly a hi-tech and industrially simple process to implement.\u2019", "\u2018So, we say that now we\u2019re poised to be able to assist experimentalists to figure out how to prise it apart, or make it to order,\u2019 said Prof Coveney. \u2018That could have big cost implications for the emerging graphene industry.\u2019", "Around 270,000 people saw Wonder Materials: Graphene and Beyond at the Museum of Science and Industry, Manchester , and so far more than 60,000\u00a0have seen the exhibition in Hong Kong , which runs until 18 April, and then continues on tour."]},

Incapable of movement itself, it uses a host to travel, controlling the direction in which it wants to go by flashing one of its five LED lights.", "The device is far less dastardly than it sounds. Unlike some parasites which infect and alter their host\u2019s central nervous system in order to control their behaviour, the parasitic robot influences the movement of its turtle host by giving it food rewards.", "Turtles are trained for almost two months, first to become accustomed to wearing the robot, and then to associate the flashing LEDs with food.", "The robot is attached to the shell of the turtle alongside a feeder tube and LED head display using special double-sided foam tape. The feeder tube is programmed to a release gelatine food capsule every time the turtle correctly follows the direction of a flashing LED light.", "After five weeks of the turtle undergoing stimuli-response training, the parasitic robot is able to control the movement of its host, completing basic navigation tasks successfully. The success of this study has encouraged researchers to consider future applications of these animal-robot partnerships, as well as other potential hosts; mice, birds and fish are all under consideration.", "This isn\u2019t the first time scientists have succeeded in controlling the movement of animals. Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley controlled the flight paths of beetles by strapping tiny computers and wireless radios onto their backs.", "Most mobile robots are limited in complex environments, unable to adjust to unforeseen obstacles. But animals are perfectly adapted to their environments. The team at KAIST believe that harnessing the natural superior abilities of animals through parasitic robots could be a more efficient way to navigate complex environments.", "It\u2019s hoped these parasitic robots could get to places where humans can\u2019t go, such as tight spaces or disaster zones. They could be used for surveillance or even military reconnaissance. Although parasitic robots raise important ethical concerns, these technologies have huge potential for use in harsh environments, and it will be interesting to see where the future of this scientific field takes us.", "If you\u2019re interested in finding out more about other types of robots, you can visit our Robots exhibition, which is on until 3 September.", "The parasitic robot will be on display in our interactive Tomorrow\u2019s World gallery until mid-October 2017.

They had decided to experiment with a pioneering new technology known as the radio-guided tour and both were eager to be the first to launch the scheme to visitors.", "The pair were neck and neck as scripts were written and new equipment installed. The Museum\u2019s director, David Follett, noted how it would be \u2018a feather in our cap\u2019 if his team could beat the Duke. With a team of expert curators, technicians and an in-house workshop on-hand to troubleshoot any technical issues, it was not long before a tour was prepared for the Museum\u2019s Iron and Steel Gallery.", "The Duke, distracted by other events, would take another eight months to produce his own tour for the State Apartments at Woburn Abbey. So the Museum won the battle, toasting its success with a special press event.", "The start of radio-guided tours at the Museum marked an important point in the history a very familiar feature at museums, galleries and heritage sites: the humble audio guide.", "Researching the radio-guided tour", "During my PhD at the University of Nottingham, I took an in-depth look at the development of the radio-guided tour at the Museum. In the history of audio guide technology in museums, this technology has been often overlooked. However, I was less interested in technological novelty, instead investigating the role of sound and sound technology in shaping the experience and interest of visitors to the Museum.", "One of the things I discovered was a connection between the radio-guided tour and a type of exhibition display, or rather an \u2018exhibition landscape\u2019.", "It might seem strange to refer to a museum exhibition as a \u2018landscape\u2019 as opposed to an exhibition space. Yet during the 1950s and 60s, \u2018landscape\u2019 described a new kind of exhibition layout aimed at a growing number of visitors with a general interest in the Museum and its exhibits.", "The term \u2018landscape\u2019 in exhibition design speak referred to the picturesque in eighteenth century landscape painting. Outside the Museum during the post-war years, a new generation of exhibition designers had revived the picturesque to shape their designs for commercial displays, trade shows and international exhibitions.", "Commissioned by the Science Museum, exhibition designer V. Rotter \u2013 one of the lead designers at the 1951 Festival of Britain \u2013 used the technique of \u2018exhibition as landscape\u2019 for the Iron and Steel Gallery. Internally too, the Museum\u2019s curators picked up on the principles of the picturesque.", "Its key principles included contrast \u2013 in scale, colour and texture \u2013 and the elements of concealment and revelation. Each was deployed to engage visitors and evoking emotions such as awe and wonder.\u00a0Gradually this new approach replaced an older kind of display at the Museum, the taxonomic approach, which had row upon row of glass and mahogany showcases.", "During my research, I discovered that it was these newer galleries that were selected to host the radio-guided tour. By studying the written scripts for each tour, I discovered the automated commentaries helped visitors interpret individual exhibits and navigate the exhibition landscape.", "So whilst the Science Museum and the Duke of Bedford vying for the accolade of pioneer of the audio guide is an amusing thought, the issue of who won or lost wasn\u2019t the focus of my research. Instead, I set out to question how and why the sound was used in the Museum as a space for learning, and I discovered a key connection between sound and a very particular kind of museum display. What fascinated me about the radio-guided tours was how the technology brought sound and landscape together to help an ever-growing number of museum visitors interested in science and technology.", "Where were the radio-guided tours installed?", "These tours were installed in the Iron and Steel Gallery, Electric Power, Sailing Ships and Acoustics galleries in the Science Museum.", "How did the technology work?", "Each tour comprised of a tape player, a radio transmitter and a set of portable radio-receivers. The tapes were fed via a radio transmitter to an induction loop antenna fixed to the ceiling of the exhibition space. The output from each tape \u2013 a vocal commentary and occasional accompanying sound \u2013 was then picked up by visitors on the ground via hand-held radio receivers . The receivers, also known as \u2018lorgnettes\u2019 could be hired from the Museum\u2019s bookstall at a cost of one shilling and a refundable deposit of ten shillings.", "What happened to the tours?", "In the end, a little like the Duke of Bedford, the Museum became distracted by other pressing matters. The modernisation of exhibitions during the 1950s and 60s put the whole Museum in a constant state of flux and change. The regular reordering of exhibits meant that commentaries quickly became obsolete and re-recording was expensive and time-consuming.", "The construction of the new Centre Block , which opened in 1963, also created a lot of unwanted noise making the commentaries often difficult to hear. A host of technical failures didn\u2019t help either, nor the occasional light-fingered listener taking off with a radio receiver! The scheme was abandoned in 1964 just four years after its launch.", "Where is the equipment now?", "A tape player, magnetic tape and a handful of \u2018lorgnette\u2019 radio receivers now reside in the Science Museum\u2019s stores at Blythe House.", "Dr. Jennifer Rich is a Cultural Engagement Fellow at the University of Nottingham.

Do other habitable planets exist? Where will we go when Earth can no longer support us? Age-old questions like these continue to drive our desire for deep space travel. But if we\u2019re to venture far beyond the planets in our solar system, we need a new method of travel. Our closest star system, Alpha Centauri, is 4.37 light years away. If it were possible to use current fuel-based space shuttles to get there, which it\u2019s not, we\u2019d be looking at a journey time of about 165,000 years. Even if we took advantage of gravitational pull to slingshot a craft in its general direction, the same technique that sent Voyager-1 into interstellar space, you\u2019d still be left with an eta of many thousands of years and would have to pass the Sun to get the top speed needed.", "", "That\u2019s why solar sails are being touted as the future of space exploration.

The satellite is built and ready to go, we just have to wait for the new rocket to be ready. We are excited to be aboard a SpaceX Falcon Heavy!\u2019 Bill Nye.", "According to experts, a solar sail craft could make the trip to Alpha Centauri in just 20 years, which is why it\u2019s now the focus of project Breakthrough Starshot whose ambition it is to do exactly that.

Others invited a broader form of citizen engagement, where a mass audience provided test subjects to further understanding of the human body and mind.", "The first experiment, which was in the latter category, was conducted with Prof Richard Wiseman of the University of Hertfordshire.

As a result, even a single tumour can contain utterly different genetic mutations in the cells at one end, compared with cells at the other.", "But because cancer cells are distorted versions of normal cells in the body, they are hard to target and destroy without causing damaging side effects. Because cancer is marked by its rapid growth doctors have, for example, used drugs that are toxic to all dividing cells in the body, causing side effects such as hair loss, nausea and so on.", "Recent years have seen the development of drugs that target cancer cells with specific mutations. These drugs shrink tumours during the first months of treatment but the cancer cells often become resistant as new mutations help to outwit the drugs, and the disease returns.", "Now the collaboration between Harvard, Edinburgh, and Johns Hopkins Universities has come up with a mathematical portrait of the evolution of solid tumours of the kind found in the breast, ovary or colon.", "", "The new work, published today in the journal Nature , is a joint project by a team that includes Bartek Waclaw a physicist and computer wizard at Edinburgh, the distinguished cancer researcher Bert Vogelstein of Johns Hopkins, and Martin Nowak, Director of Harvard\u2019s Program for Evolutionary Dynamics, who has spent decades trying to put biology on a mathematical basis, along with his colleague in Harvard University, Ivana Bozic.", "Although biologists traditionally complain that disease processes are too complex to boil down to mathematics, Nowak believes the new model can explain various features of cancer, from why cancer cells share a surprising number of mutations in common, to why tumours spread and become resistant to anti-cancer drugs.", "The new mathematical model captures the complex way that DNA mutates in different tumour cells, which makes some cells more suited to the environment than others, and how cancer spreads. Until now, these have been modelled separately. \u201cMost previous efforts counted the number of cells with particular DNA changes but not their spatial arrangement,\u201d says Nowak. \u201cNow we can model both the genetic evolution and the 3D growth of a cancer.\u201d", "One of the new insights to emerge is that cancer growth depends greatly on the ability of tumour cells to cells to divide if they have sufficient space. This means the tumour grows slowly unless cells are able to move to find enough room. \u201cCellular mobility makes cancers grow fast, and it makes cancers similar in the sense that cancer cells share a common set of mutations,\u201d says Nowak. That, he thinks, is why drug resistance rapidly evolves.", "In the video , similar colours denote similar mutations and \u2013 as the tumour grows \u2013 they remain clustered together, as also shown by experiment. Of the billions of cancer cells that exist in a patient, only a tiny percentage \u2013 about one in a million \u2013 are resistant to drugs used in targeted therapy. When treatment starts, the video shows how non-resistant cells are wiped out \u2013 but the few resistant cells quickly repopulate the cancer.", "There is another insight to emerge from focusing on cell movements within the tumour: they go on to evolve the ability to spread throughout the body, to metastasize, which is usually what makes cancer deadly. Nowak says: \u201cThe ability to form metastases is a consequence of selection for local migration, that is Darwinian processes favour cells with the ability to move around the body.\u201d", "These insights, which are a \u2018beautiful confirmation of what is seen in experiments,\u2019 do not provide a \u2018miraculous cure,\u2019 said Bartek Waclaw, \u201cHowever, they do suggest possible ways of improving cancer therapy.\u201d\u00a0 The video shows how cancer cells switch to a state when they can deform and move around and, he says, treatments that hinder these small movements of cancerous cells could help to slow progress of the disease.", "The attempts through history to understand and combat diseases such as cancer can be found in the Science Museum\u2019s medicine collections, which contain over 140,000 objects.

The National Railway Museum holds lots of pictures of Mallard as well as pictures of the crew, Driver Joe Duddington in his trademark flat cap, Fireman Tommy Bray grinning with his bulging arm muscles and Inspector Sam Jenkins with his piercing look. We therefore had plenty of information to make a motion ride experience full and enjoyable, and after all if 15 th Century Venice can be modelled for a computer game why not the east coast main line in the 1930\u2019s?", "Whilst the landscape, tunnels and bridges have not changed (much), the stations on the route of the record run have mostly disappeared, as have the signals. The track layout has also been altered. Finding a picture of Little Bytham station of the right period swiftly turned into finding any picture of Little Bytham that was good enough to model what the driver saw when Mallard broke the world speed record.", "Exactly what did the bridges and tunnels look like? A need for good photographs of the route was crucial and initial searches of the National Railway Museum\u2019s massive database of images provided very little. Fortunately the Search Engine research centre at the National Railway Museum\u00a0is the best resource for studying railway history, and if there wasn\u2019t an image in the database, there were good reference images in books and articles about the route.", "One other issue was Mallard itself. Nigel Gresley, the locomotive\u2019s architect, designed Mallard and his\u00a0A4 Pacifics so that they ran smoothly at high-speed \u2013 they were no roller coaster ride. In fact A4\u2019s were so smooth running that they were retro fitted under the fireman\u2019s seat with a form of speedometer that provided a paper trace of each journey. This spy in the cab was so that Driver\u2019s could be warned about parts of the route where they had been speeding when they got back to the shed. This would make for a boring and not very bumpy motion ride, so to compensate the film developers went for a fly-through the locomotive at speed and filmed scenes from outside the locomotive to add interest for the audience.", "", "So from careful research, Mallard\u2019s record run was re-created in an animated 3D film.

The theory also requires a large amount of \u201cfine-tuning\u201d to match experimental observations, leaving it looking suspiciously like the laws of physics have been tinkered with in a very unnatural way to produce the Universe we live in.", "In the last few decades a number of theories have been put forward that attempt to solve some of the Standard Model\u2019s problems. One particularly popular idea is supersymmetry (SUSY for short), which proposes a slew of new fundamental particles, each one a mirror image of the particles of the Standard Model.", "SUSY has many attractive features: it provides a neat explanation for dark matter and unifies the strengths of the three forces of the Standard Model (this suggests that they could all be aspects of one unified force, which should definitely be referred to as The Force , if it turns out to exist someday). It would also keep my colleagues in work for decades to come, thanks to a whole new load of super-particles (or sparticles ) to discover and study.", "However, physicists were first attracted to it because the theory is aesthetically pleasing. Unlike the Standard Model, SUSY doesn\u2019t require any awkward fine-tuning to produce laws of physics that match our experience. This is not a very scientific argument, more a desire amongst physicists for theories to be elegant, but historically it has often been the case that the most beautiful theory turns out to be right one.", "On the hunt", "The decay observed at LHCb and CMS is predicted to be extremely rare in the Standard Model, with a B s meson only decaying into two muons about 3 times in every billion. However, if ideas like SUSY are correct than the chances of the decay can be significantly boosted.", "Finding particle decays this rare makes hunting for a needle in a haystack seem like a doddle. Hundreds of millions of collisions take place every second at the LHC, each one producing hundreds of new particles that leave electrical signals in the giant detectors. Physicists from LHCb and CMS trawled through two years worth of data, searching untold trillions of collisions for signs of two muons coming from a B s meson. The pressure to be the first to find evidence of this rare process was intense, as Dr. Marc-Olivier Bettler, a colleague of mine from Cambridge and member of the LHCb team told me.", "\u201cIt is a very strange type of race. To avoid bias, we don\u2019t allow ourselves to look at the data until the last minute. So it\u2019s a bit like running blindfolded \u2013 you can\u2019t see the landscape around you or your competitors, even though you know that they\u2019re there, so you have no idea if you are doing well or not! You only find out after you cross the finish line.\u201d", "However, ultimately the race ended in a draw. Neither LHCb nor CMS alone had enough data to announce a formal discovery, each turning up just a handful of likely candidates. But when their results are formally combined next week it is expected that the number of observed decays will pass the all-important \u201cfive sigma\u201d level, above which a discovery can be declared.", "Standard Model Stands Firm", "In a blow for supporters of SUSY, LHCb and CMS observed the decay occurring at exactly the rate predicted by the Standard Model \u2013 approximately 3 times in a billion. This is yet another triumph for the Standard Model and kills off a number of the most popular SUSY theories.", "Professor Val Gibson, leader of the Cambridge particle physics group and member of the LHCb experiment explained that, \u201c Measurements of this very rare decay significantly squeeze the places new physics can hide. We are now looking forward to the LHC returning at even higher energy and to an upgrade of the experiment so that we can investigate why new physics is so shy.\u201d", "This result is certainly not the end of the road for ideas like supersymmetry, which has many different versions.\u00a0However, combined with the recent discovery of the Higgs boson (whose mass is larger than predicted by many SUSY theories) this new result may only leave us with versions of SUSY that are somewhat inelegant, meaning that the original motivation \u2013 a natural description of nature \u2013 is lost.", "This new result from CERN is yet another demonstration of the fantastic (and somewhat annoying) accuracy of the Standard Model. Incredible precision is now being achieved by experiments at the LHC, allowing physicists to uncover ever-rarer particles and phenomena. If ideas like supersymmetry are to survive the onslaught of high precision tests made by the LHC experiments, we may have to accept that we live in a spookily fine-tuned Universe."]},

Some of the tools are the first of their kind on Mars, such as a laser-firing instrument for checking the composition of rocks from a distance.", "The rover will use a drill and scoop at the end of its robotic arm to gather soil and powdered samples of rock interiors, then sieve and parcel out these samples into analytical laboratory instruments inside the rover.", "Follow the mission on Facebook and Twitter and find pictures on the Nasa website ."]},

This for me was the most exciting part of my internship. Much of the research was done either in the Dana Research Centre and Library at the Science Museum, Imperial College Engineering library, or the archives at the Courtauld Institute \u2013 where I found some fascinating catalogues from C\u00e9sar\u2019s early exhibitions .", "My favourite part of this research process was the chances I had to meet with experts. The first of these was Ben Russell, curator of mechanical engineering at the Science Museum. His passion for all things iron was infectious, and he really helped to bring the mysteries of this ubiquitous substance vividly to life.", "I also met with Dr Shaun Crofton of Imperial College, London. Dr Crofton is a welding expert and explained this particularly technical skill to me with great humour, wit and an astonishing breadth of knowledge. My project is heavily indebted to both these brilliant minds.", "After my meetings with the experts, my internship was focused on weaving the stories they\u2019d told me, and those that the archives had revealed, into a engaging label and webpage .", "After this process, the placing of this heavy and ungainly sculpture into its case in the Science Museum seemed the easiest part of the puzzle.", "I have been unable to see Habitation for many months, with the closure of the Science Museum and Courtauld Gallery Archives due to COVID-19. After spending so much time looking at photos, it was a special moment to be able to stand back and admire the real thing.", "I hope that museum visitors are as surprised by it as I was when I first saw it.", "And I hope those visitors find, as I did, that Habitation rewards those who lean in, walk round, stand back to observe it.

Made from Silver Cloud granite, the work comprises two stone benches with texts sandblasted into their seats. The stone evokes a monument or memorial, which speaks to discussions elsewhere in the gallery of how we think about death and dying.", "The title \u2018Faith, Hope and Fear\u2019 refers to the gallery\u2019s focus on the emotional impact of medicine and the objects, people, ideas, and beliefs to which we turn when facing illness and the disruption it brings.", "It considers how our ideas of health and disease are shaped by our social and cultural backgrounds, and acknowledges that modern medicine is one of many approaches people take (and have taken, in different times and places) to managing the unpredictability of sickness and treatment.", "Holzer chose the texts to be inscribed into the benches in consultation with the museum team. They originate from two diverse authors who both experienced cancer diagnoses and whose influential writing about illness she describes as \u201cexpansive and frank\u201d: Susan Sontag and Paul Kalanithi.", "American philosopher Sontag wrote Illness as Metaphor (1978) while being treated for breast cancer. Her opening lines, \u201c Illness is the night side of life \u201d introduce the idea that we have citizenship of two countries throughout our lives \u2013 the realms of the well and the sick \u2013 and our \u2018residence\u2019 in one or the other profoundly affects our own and society\u2019s perceptions of us. The book highlights how the language we use to describe certain diseases can result in stereotyping and stigmatisation of patients.", "From her background as a cultural critic, Sontag called for a rejection of metaphor and cultural understandings of illness in favour of empirical science and its objective focus on causes and treatment. Others have disputed this position, contending that metaphor is one of the main ways in which human beings make sense of the world.", "Kalanithi\u2019s complex question \u201c What kind of life exists without language? \u201d comes from the memoir, When Breath Becomes Air (2016), published soon after his death from lung cancer.", "Kalanithi was used to every tiny movement he made as a neurosurgeon presenting huge potential implications for the patient; his profession laid bare the extraordinary delicacy of cognitive functions such as emotion, memory, and language.", "Kalanithi\u2019s diagnosis transformed his perspective from doctor to patient and led him to reflect on the ethical decisions at the heart of his work. The quote Holzer selected refers to the significance of language for meaning in human relationships.", "Kalanithi studied English and philosophy before pursuing his medical career and recognised the importance of both disciplines to his chosen field.", "Holzer\u2019s benches join an important and growing body of works by female artists in the collections of the Science Museum Group. Within \u2018Faith, Hope and Fear\u2019 For Science is in conversation with Eleanor Crook\u2019s sculpture Santa Medicina (also on display in the galleries) which likewise draws, albeit in very different ways, on material and social histories of medicine.", "Elsewhere in Medicine: The Wellcome Galleries, Si\u00e2n Davey\u2019s life-size portrait photographs similarly bring different voices to bare on experiences of medicine. Another highlight of the collection is Barbara Hepworth\u2019s Surgery Sketchbook from 1948, the only surviving sketchbook from a two-year period that the artist spent intimately observing surgical procedures.", "Holzer\u2019s work was commissioned to mark a year since the opening of the Medicine Galleries. It has not been the year that any of us could have anticipated, but has certainly emphasised the importance of society, community, and empathy in how we understand our medical experiences.", "In resting on these works, touching, reading, and discussing the words, we hope that visitors will find a place to pause and take stock."]},

All planetary missions need these to make sure they hit their target! That Hope required only three such manoeuvres on the way to Mars \u2013 it can be far more \u2013 was itself a source of joy for the young space engineers and scientists working on their first ever interplanetary mission.", "The United States, on the other hand, has launched many spacecraft to the planet but its Mars 2020 mission with the Perseverance rover on board is the most ambitious and sophisticated of them all. The \u2018 seven minutes of terror\u2019 when ground controllers wait in silence for the signal that the lander and its rover have survived their fiery descent through the Martian atmosphere will give way to much cheering, flag waving and jubilation when that signal comes through 18 February, 2021.", "China\u2019s ground controllers will have to endure a similar wait while Tianwen-1\u2019s lander and rover descends to the Martian surface two months later. This mission bears witness to China\u2019s careful, long-term planning of its space programme which just this week saw the landing on the Moon of Chang\u2019e-5, a robotic mission to bring lunar samples to Earth \u2013 the first time that will have been done since the Soviet Union\u2019s Luna 24 in 1976.", "The national objectives of these three missions are clear and yet they all incorporate an international dimension as well. Mars 2020 carries experiments from Spain and Norway as well as those from the US. China\u2019s Tianwen-1 carries instruments on its rover and orbiter that French and Austrian teams helped with. And the UAE\u2019s Hope mission planners teamed with universities in the US during the spacecraft\u2019s development.", "Such international collaboration is by no means confined to Mars missions. The Science Museum proudly displays an engineering model of the BepiColombo spacecraft, its flight version now over two years into its 7 year journey to Mercury. \u2018Bepi\u2019 is a collaborative venture from the 22 member state European Space Agency (ESA) and JAXA \u2013Japan\u2019s Aerospace Exploration Agency.

Before long satellites will be launched from spaceports in Cornwall and Scotland, the first time missions have been launched from British soil. But these endeavours too will be truly international affairs with overseas companies and agencies working with the UK on both the launch sites and the satellites themselves.", "Underpinning all these missions and programmes, however, is a far more deeply engrained internationalism. In 1958 the United Nations created a new Office for Outer Space Affairs.", "It was just a year since the Soviet Union had launched Sputnik, the first artificial satellite of the Earth. The United States had responded with its Explorer 1 satellite a few months later and the space race between the two Cold War rivals was well underway. With humanity having breached the frontier of space the UN\u2019s new Office was charged with running a newly created Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space.", "To this day the Office manages the space treaties that enable the \u2018orderly conduct of activities in outer space\u2019. These cover such issues as \u2018the freedom of exploration and use of space for the benefit and interest of all countries\u2019 and \u2018the non-appropriation of outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies.\u2019 These agreements also commit nations \u2018to assist an astronaut in case of accident, distress, emergency or unintended landing\u2019. They have also established standards of liability for damage caused by space objects falling to the Earth. And for those who need to know what exactly is up there (approximately 6,000 satellites, functioning or dead at the last count) the treaties requires the space-faring nations of the world to register all objects launched into outer space .", "As important is the programme of projects the UNOOSA oversees to encourage and help develop space applications for the benefit of people around the world.\u00a0 Global health, environment, disaster monitoring and response, communication and transportation are but a few of the areas in which the Office provides assistance and guidance.", "Space is essential for the achievement of the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals that guide global developmental efforts until 2030. Over 40% of these directly benefit from space applications and if one was to add telecommunications enabled by space the percentage would be higher still. UNOOSA works to help all countries access the enormous benefits of space and so help them advance on the Sustainable Development Goals .", "And as we approach the third decade of the 21 st century there is still more for the UNOOSA to consider and help manage as the number of nations, agencies and companies that can reach space increase dramatically.", "The space sector is expanding rapidly, with new actors entering the arena and fast technological advancements opening new opportunities. In this increasingly complex environment, at UNOOSA we work to advance international cooperation among both established and emerging space actors, to ensure space is an inclusive arena and that its benefits reach everyone, everywhere.", "International cooperation to facilitate the development and use of space applications is essential to address the common challenges we face on earth, from climate change to disaster risk reduction. Furthermore, it is our duty to preserve space for future generations, and international cooperation is essential to protect space as a global commons and ensure its long-term sustainable use. \u2013 UNOOSA Director Simonetta Di Pippo, 25 November, 2020", "Fifty two years ago this Christmas the crew of Apollo 8 looked back on their home planet from lunar orbit. The photographs Bill Anders took as Earth appeared in all its majesty and beauty from behind the barren Moon lodged in the human psyche. Subsequent missions repeated the shots which are now known collectively and simply as \u2018Earthrise\u2019.", "All those years ago space exploration enabled us, for the very first time, to look back on our place in space as one world where international borders are all but invisible.

We sailed from Ushuaia at the bottom of Argentina through an incredible storm with waves about ten meters high for two days. My first impression of seeing land having been thrown around on a boat, feeling like I was a weightless astronaut, was a sense of relief.", "It was like something I\u2019d never seen before, where there\u2019s no sign of humanity at all and just literally hundreds of whales. Whale after whale and penguin after penguin and full of wildlife and these beautifully sculpted icebergs. It genuinely felt like we\u2019d arrived on another planet.", "SM: What surprised you the most about the icy continent?", "JK: I think it was just the amount of wildlife. You look out from the side of the boat and there are killer whales, minke whales, humpback whales, sei whales \u2013 and then pods of penguins swimming as well. It was a constant stream of animals.", "When we went to film with leopard seals, there were just thousands upon thousands of penguins. And what I loved as well is that they aren\u2019t afraid of us at all. You go to so many places in the rest of the world and animals run away or they\u2019re scarce, and actually in Antarctica, there are penguins sat right next to you. It means it\u2019s great for the giant screen because you can get really nice and close and it makes it feel intimate, like you\u2019re really there.", "SM: Can you share some of your most memorable moments from the film shoot?", "JK: We were working with some Argentinian scientists who were the most hospitable, friendly people. They fed us, played music, danced with us \u2013 we were all in our full Antarctic gear with boots and everything, and we would dance with them in the evenings, so that was a wonderful memory.", "And of course, the memory of all the penguins when all the chicks had grown up and shed all their fluffy feathers and they all walk down to the sea for their first swim. They\u2019re sat next to you waiting to go in and then some of them fall a sleep maybe a couple of meters away, so trusting. That\u2019s a really sweet moment and it makes it all the harder when they then jump in the ice sea and they\u2019ve got to somehow escape the jaws of a massive leopard seal.", "SM: Were there any amazing moments of animal behaviour that you witnessed?", "JK: One incredible animal moment where I suddenly thought, \u2018OK, that\u2019s in the film\u2019: when a penguin manages to escape the jaws of a leopard seal and climbs onto an iceberg. The leopard climbs up onto the iceberg after it and is inching closer. The poor little penguin is just exhausted.", "And this was happening right in front of us!", "The leopard seal has its mouth open and the penguin is leaning forward and trying to peck this huge predator to get it away.

It was so brave and\u2026 well, I won\u2019t spoil it, you\u2019ll have to see the film.", "SM: What was the biggest challenge of filming in Antarctica?", "JK: It\u2019s about the most mindful thing you can do to be sat on a coastline where no one else is and you\u2019re watching penguins, waiting for some behaviour to happen. There is nothing challenging about it, it doesn\u2019t matter that it\u2019s cold or windy or that it\u2019s snowy. I just found it really fascinating to sit from morning until evening, to watch and observe and then to capture it and turn it into engaging images for an interesting and inspiring story \u2013 that\u2019s about as good as it gets.", "SM: One of the main themes in the film is how what happens in Antarctica affects us all, even though the vast majority of us will never visit the continent. Can you explain a bit more about this?", "JK: This is something that only came to light while we were making the film. We realised that actually Antarctica may be so far away and so remote but what happens there affects all of us, because all the life in the southern oceans and oceans themselves absorb, trap and lock away so much carbon \u2013 more than double that the Amazon rainforest does every year.", "We\u2019ve also got an amazing sequence in the film of hundreds of whales and you realise that these whales in the last 40 years since commercial whaling was largely banned in the 1980s have made a terrific come back, and the amount of carbon that they trap is so important. If these whales weren\u2019t there, the oceans wouldn\u2019t be healthy, carbon wouldn\u2019t be trapped, and we\u2019d all be much more impacted by climate change.", "SM: What do you hope audiences will take out of the film?", "JK: What I really love is the idea that audiences will come and enjoy the film. I want them to feel happy, inspired and awestruck but also hopeful and uplifted. I also want them to maybe take away that thought that actually what happens here in Antarctica is really critical for all of us and it\u2019s worth fighting for.", "Watch BBC Earth\u2019s latest documentary Antarctica 3D , narrated by Benedict Cumberbatch, exclusively at the Science Museum\u2019s new IMAX: The Ronson Theatre from Wednesday 9 December.

If the scientific results suggest it did then the likelihood of life being found throughout the universe is great indeed.", "The sample return programme being kicked off by Perseverance will involve three separate spacecraft.

Almost 50 km wide, it was once flooded with water but is now an arid, dusty bed of clay. When a lake this crater might have provided the necessary conditions for life which would have left mineral traces in the clay sediments when the water disappeared.", "As exploring Mars by robotic rover is a slow process, Perseverance\u2019s landing platform will also be carrying a helicopter called Ingenuity .", "If this little aircraft works, then future missions will be able to cover more ground far more quickly. Ingenuity will make use of new technologies that allow its large rotor blades to spin extra quickly to generate the necessary lift (in an atmosphere far less dense than Earth\u2019s) to get it off the ground.", "Another experiment that may prove useful for future missions to Mars will attempt to produce small quantities of oxygen from the carbon dioxide of Mars\u2019 atmosphere. If successful, it will pave the way for producing far larger oxygen quantities which could be used by astronauts to breathe and to make rocket propellant.

Separating actinium was no easy task \u2013 naturally occurring uranium contains only a tiny proportion of actinium, about 0.2mg in one tonne (1,000,000 grams).", "During her work Perey began to suspect that an anomaly in the radiation coming from actinium might be caused by a new element with a very short half-life (i.e. it decayed very rapidly).", "She worked on the problem and on 7 January 1939 managed to establish that the anomaly was indeed caused by a new element with atomic number 87. She did this by quickly measuring the radioactivity of freshly purified actinium (atomic number 89), then again later. The initial activity was different, but soon became that normally seen from actinium.", "Perey hypothesised that some of the actinium had, because of the emission of alpha particles, become an isotope (that is a version of a chemical element with a different number of neutrons in its nucleus) of element 87. The new element had a half-life measured in minutes and quickly decayed away.", "Chemists knew that Mendeleev\u2019s periodic table was missing the element at atomic number 87, which should be an alkali metal with chemical properties like caesium. Perey tested her hypothesis by precipitating caesium as the perchlorate in the presence of the new element.", "Perey was right \u2013 the new element 87 co-precipitated with caesium, proving that it had very similar chemical properties. As the discoverer, Perey had the privilege of naming the new element. She called it francium, after her native France.", "Discovering a new element was a major scientific achievement worthy of a doctorate at least, but because Marguerite was only a laboratory assistant with no university degree, she could not be awarded one.

Like Edwards she was based in Cambridge, and she regularly drove the hundreds of miles to their clinic in Oldham, Greater Manchester, taking her away from home for days at a time. Purdy was so indispensable that when she was unable to travel while caring for her ailing mother, all work stopped for several months . Of that time Edwards recalled, \u2018Jean\u2019s cooperation had become crucial. It was no longer just Patrick and me. We had become a threesome.\u2019", "Purdy was not just central to the running of the lab but also to the scientific work. She was a co-author with Robert Edwards on 26 academic publications between 1970 and 1985 and has been credited with being the first person ever to recognise and describe the formation of the early human blastocyst. Her role as an embryologist also led her to be the first person to witness the successful cell division of the embryo that would become Louise Brown, the first IVF baby.", "When the team finally found IVF success with the births of Louise Brown and Alastair MacDonald, it was time for them to find a new clinic. It was Purdy that hunted through the old manor houses of Cambridge and finally found Bourn Hall, the first IVF clinic and one that is still running today.", "Clearly Purdy was integral to IVF, but even today her name is rarely mentioned. When asking why this might be, we could point to her tragic and early death in 1985, cutting her off in her prime and preventing her from contributing to the many books and documentaries that came later. But this is probably only part of the reason. Patrick Steptoe died in 1988, soon after Purdy but also long before the Nobel Prize that was awarded to Robert Edwards for the work in 2010. Steptoe\u2019s name does not seem to have been lost to the passage of time.", "We could also ask if Purdy\u2019s gender meant she was taken less seriously by reporters. Or was her role as a lab technician seen as unimportant next to that of the surgeon and the scientist? Whatever the reason, it was not for lack of trying from Edwards. He repeatedly emphasised Purdy\u2019s importance and unsuccessfully lobbied her name to be added to the commemorative plaque placed at the site of their original clinic.", "Forty years since the development of IVF there is renewed interest in Jean Purdy, and her name can finally be seen alongside those of Robert Edwards and Patrick Steptoe on a Royal Society of Biology blue plaque, unveiled in 2015. For us at the Science Museum it has been a pleasure to learn about her work as an IVF pioneer and right this historical wrong within our exhibition. You can\u2019t put everything in an exhibition, but there are some things you absolutely cannot leave out.", "See IVF: 6 Million Babies Later at the Science Museum\u2019s Who Am I? gallery until 25 November 2018.

The disease also killed in large numbers and had an especially high fatality rate amongst young children.", "Jenner had previously been variolating people, a method first recorded in China approximately a thousand years ago, which involved the deliberate infection of a person with a disease in the hope that a mild, but protective, infection would result.", "In the local Gloucestershire countryside, Jenner became aware of a similar practice amongst local farming communities.", "Milkmaids, who were renowned for their clear complexions, were often immune to smallpox and its scarring pock marks because they were exposed to a milder disease of cattle disease known as cowpox.", "Jenner decided to test the effectiveness of this technique and in 1796 carried out his first successful vaccination .", "He took pus from a cowpox pustule on the hand of milkmaid Sarah Nelmes and inserted it into a cut made in the arm of a young boy named James Phipps .\u00a0This became known as the \u2018arm-to-arm\u2019 method as it involved the direct transferral of infected matter straight from one person\u2019s arm to another.", "Six weeks later, Jenner inoculated young James with smallpox matter and the boy showed no signs of the disease.", "Jenner called the procedure \u2018vaccination\u2019 after the Latin word for cow (vacca) and published his findings to the scientific community.", "Though his apparent discovery gained some interest, it was also met with criticism and even ridicule.", "As with variolation, many early critics thought vaccination was unclean or immoral, especially because it involved transferring \u2018foreign\u2019 fluids into their bodies.", "Whilst there was some support from members of the church, there was much religious opposition.

They are said to be entangled \u2013 think of it like interference \u2013 so that they can perform parallel computing.", "Even though Sycamore had a relatively modest number of quantum bits (qubits) \u2013 just 53 \u2013 it could sample the solutions of the \u2018random circuit sampling problem\u2019 in a mere 200 seconds, whereas the Google team estimated that Summit supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, would take 10,000 years to do the same thing, while full verification would take millions of years.", "Prof Lu commented: \u2018While Google used superconducting circuits inside an ultracold fridge, we used photons \u2013 particles of light \u2013 at room temperature. It is nice to demonstrate the quantum advantage using different platforms.\u2019", "Quantum advantage, or supremacy, does not necessarily indicate that the quantum computers are yet useful. This is because the problems that they are set are selected to be difficult for classical computers and tend to be more esoteric.", "Moreover, it remains possible that classical computers can catch up. After Google\u2019s quantum supremacy claim, for example, IBM proposed a type of calculation that might allow a supercomputer to perform the task Google\u2019s computer completed, casting doubt on the claim.", "\u2018All these claims are based on the current optimal classical algorithm/strategy, which may improve as time goes by,\u2019 commented Prof Lu. \u2018Quantum computational advantage, rather than being a one-shot experimental proof, will be the result of a long-term competition between a quantum device and classical simulation.\u2019", "Jiuzhang is an analogue machine, that is, a computer which exploits the physical properties of a system to tackle a problem. In this case, the problem is called boson sampling, where bosons are one of the basic classes of particles, which includes photons, which are particles of light.", "\u2018We use photons as bosons, not as qubits,\u2019 said Prof Lu, who reported the feat with colleagues in the journal Science . \u2018Strictly, the power of Jiuzhang cannot be expressed in terms of qubits.\u2019", "Boson sampling entails calculating the probability distribution of many bosons \u2014 in this case, photons \u2014 after they encounter a device called a beam splitter, which divides a single beam into divergent beams.", "The laser light had been manipulated using its quantum properties (in other words, it had been \u2018squeezed\u2019) and, because of quantum effects, if two photons of identical properties (position and polarisation) hit the splitter at the same time, they stuck together and both travelled in the same direction.", "Only when you send lots of pulses through the device do reliable interference patterns emerge. Jiuzhang sent laser pulses into a maze of 300 beam splitters, 75 mirrors and 100 detectors capable of spotting a single photon. \u2018We detected up to 76 photons,\u2019 said Prof Lu.", "With enough photons and beam splitters, Jiuzhang could produce a distribution of numbers of photons that \u2013 because the problem scales exponentially \u2013 lies beyond the reach of a classical computer to calculate: using Jiuzhang the team achieved within minutes what would take half the age of Earth using the best existing supercomputers.", "One advantage of digital computers \u2013 and Sycamore too \u2013 is that they can be programmed to do different things while Jiuzhang is designed only to do boson sampling. \u2018Very tricky point,\u2019 said Prof Lu. \u2018Most people think that Jiuzhang is not programmable.\u00a0 But, actually, to some extent it already can be. We will try to make use of some tuning knobs in the incoming light to do something useful in a few months.\u2019", "Prof Lu added that boson sampling can also be adapted for machine learning, a popular approach to artificial intelligence. \u2018We are performing such an experiment and aiming for applications in machine learning,\u2019 said Prof Lu. Compared with conventional computers, photon-based devices such as Jiuzhang offer advantages because they consume a fraction of the power, have higher throughput and work at the speed of light.", "There is a limit to what digital computers can do because the binary numbers on which they depend \u2013 ones and zeroes \u2013 offer a much more limited palette of mathematical possibilities than the continuous, or analogue, quantities of the real world. In contrast, \u2019Jiuzhang is an analogue device,\u2019 said Prof Lu.", "The first computers were also analogue, that is, physical systems configured to be governed by equations identical to the ones you want to solve. The Science Museum Group collection has various analogue machines, such as the \u2018differential analyser\u2019 developed by Douglas Hartree at the University of Manchester , capable of solving differential equations that are fundamental to modelling the world because they describe how things change.", "Traditional analogue machines were cumbersome in every sense. They represented the quantity they were computing as the size of some part of the apparatus. If you wanted a more accurate answer, you needed a bigger device:\u00a0 because the information is encoded in a physical way (think of the markings on a slide rule, for example) an extra bit of precision doubles the size of the device.", "By contrast, abstracting the input data from an analogue form into a string of ones and zeros allows digital computers to be reprogrammed to perform multiple types of calculations, unlike their purpose-built analogue predecessors. However, analogue devices based on light such as Jiuzhang offer new possibilities for fast, low power parallel computing.", "There is a deeper, unresolved, issue with quantum computing. There has been unease about the foundations of quantum theory since Albert Einstein, who helped establish the theory and became one of its most dogged critics. The\u00a0 2020 physics Nobel prize-winner, Sir Roger Penrose, told me recently that, though successful at some things, \u2018current quantum mechanics is wrong.\u2019", "Quantum mechanics is wrong because it is incomplete, explained Prof Peter Coveney of UCL, who helped organise a quantum computer event in 2019 at the Science Museum . \u2018When it comes to quantum computers, for example, it does not explain how you go from the entangled/interference/superposition of zeroes and ones in a qubit to a single output value, a one or a zero.\u2019", "Prof Lu commented: \u2018quantum mechanics is 120 years old but some of the very fundamental issues still bother us today.\u2019"]},

Not only did she overcome these barriers to make history as NASA\u2019s first black female engineer, but she also dedicated much of her life to empowering those around her.", "She tutored high school and college students, served as a Girl Scout leader for 30 years, and used her engineering expertise to help a local African American science club construct their own wind tunnel and perform experiments to investigate airflow around model aircraft, all alongside her remarkable career.

The 4ft by 4ft (1.2m by 1.2m) tunnel was used to test the aerodynamics of model aircraft.", "Under Czarnecki, Jackson had the chance to gain first-hand experience of conducting research experiments. It was Czarnecki\u2019s suggestion that she should go for an engineering position, a role that would require her to take graduate-level classes in maths and physics.", "The classes were part of a night programme offered by the University of Virginia, but were held at an all-white high school, and Jackson had to petition the City of Hampton to be allowed to attend. She was successful, and in 1958 was promoted to aerospace engineer, becoming NASA\u2019s first black female engineer.", "As an aerospace engineer, Jackson\u2019s role was to analyse data from wind tunnel experiments as well as real test flights to understand how airflow interacted with the aircraft, so as to improve the design of US aeroplanes.", "During her engineering career, she worked in several NASA divisions, eventually attaining the most senior title in the engineering department, and authored or co-authored 12 technical papers.", "In 1979, after just over 20 years as an engineer, Jackson decided to turn her career towards championing equal opportunities.

With names like serine, leucine and alanine, nature strings together different combinations of these amino acids in proteins, whether those in hair, skin and muscle or the ones that break down food in the stomach.", "Now researchers in Cambridge have found a way to create a synthetic bacterium to make proteins composed of novel amino acids, designed by scientists, that lie beyond the canonical 20 found in nature.", "The synthetic bacterium was not only able to make novel kinds of protein, far more complicated than anything that can be made in the lab by chemists, but the genetic alteration rendered it virtually invincible to infection with viruses.", "To carry out the feat, the team at the Medical Research Council (MRC) Laboratory of Molecular Biology led by Prof Jason Chin engineered the genetic code of a synthetic strain of the gut bacterium E. coli to include several nonstandard amino acids, akin to writing a book with several made-up letters in addition to the usual 26, from A to Z.", "The advance rests on details of how huge molecular machines \u2013 ribosomes \u2013 that turn genetic code into protein within the bacterium read three \u201cletters\u201d of genetic code at a time, a \u201cword\u201d known as a codon, of which there are 64 different combinations.", "There are only 20 amino acids because some are specified by more than one word: for example, the four different codons TCG, TCA, AGC and AGT all code for the same amino acid, serine.", "In May 2019, Chin\u2019s team reported in the journal Nature that it had simplified the E. coli \u2019s entire genetic code, or genome, so that it packs information more efficiently into the four million letters of DNA that provide the instructions for making a cell.", "His team made an organism with a radically altered genome \u2013 the largest synthetic genome ever constructed from scratch \u2013 that used three fewer codons than the usual number. Though the modified bacteria \u2013 called Syn61 \u2013 no longer had the codons in their genome they could still make normal proteins and thrive.", "Now, by further engineering of their bacteria, Chin\u2019s team has been able to use the three codons removed from the genome to encode three \u201cnoncanonical amino acids\u201d which are not found in nature; the result is synthetic E. coli with properties not found in biology.", "The researchers were able to use the synthetic bacterium to create polymers made of up to eight chemical units \u2013 monomers \u2013 strung together and join the ends to make macrocycles \u2013 a type of molecule that forms the basis of some drugs, such as certain antibiotics and cancer drugs.", "Prof Chin says his research could lead to the development of novel polymers \u2013 large molecules made of many repeating units, such as proteins, plastics, and many drugs, including antibiotics.", "Synthetic bacteria \u2018may be turned into renewable and programmable factories that produce a wide range of new polymer molecules with novel properties, which could have benefits for biotechnology and medicine, including making new drugs, such as new antibiotics,\u2019 he says.", "\u2018We\u2019d like to use these bacteria to discover and build long synthetic polymers that fold up into structures and may form new classes of materials. For example, we will investigate applications of this technology to develop novel polymers, such as biodegradable plastics, which could contribute to a circular bioeconomy.\u2019", "In the study, published yesterday in the journal Science , the Cambridge researchers also infected their synthetic bacteria with a cocktail of viruses. While natural bacteria were killed by the viruses the modified bacteria were resistant and survived.", "The reason is that viruses reproduce by injecting their genetic instructions into a host cell, in this case a bacterium, and hijacking its cellular machinery.", "However, when the machinery in the modified bacteria tries to read the virus genome, it fails every time it reaches the missing codons, halting the replication of the virus.", "This ability to shrug off viruses is important because many drugs \u2013 for example, protein drugs, such as insulin, and polysaccharide and protein subunit vaccines, including some being developed for COVID-19 \u2013 are manufactured by growing bacteria which contain instructions to produce the drug.", "\u2018If a virus gets into the vats of bacteria used to manufacture certain drugs, then it can destroy the whole batch,\u2019 says Prof Chin. \u2018Our modified bacterial cells could overcome this problem by being completely resistant to viruses. Because viruses use the full genetic code, the modified bacteria won\u2019t be able to read the viral genes.\u2019", "Although some may be uneasy about where this technology is heading, Prof Chin emphasised that, since humans harnessed fire, they have realised there is an upside and a downside to innovation \u2013 it is important experiments are done in a controlled way and properly discussed and debated with the public.", "The first synthetic organism was created by the American biotech entrepreneur Craig Venter , whose microbial replicant based on a copy of the genetic code of the tiny bacterium Mycoplasma genitalium was unveiled in 2010 . The new work in Cambridge depends on a smaller team and is much easier to scale up, says Prof Chin.", "Dr Megan Dowie, head of molecular and cellular medicine at the Medical Research Council, which funded the study to expand the lexicon of life, commented that it marks \u2018a really exciting example of the value of a long-term commitment to fundamental, or discovery, science.\u2019", "Such research \u2018has huge potential for major impact in biopharma and other industrial settings.\u2019"]},

The craft was called \u2018SR-N1\u2019 (Saunders Roe Number 1), and it too flew across the Channel, fifty years to the day since Bleriot first flew over. But this flight, in 1959, was very close to the water.", "You guessed it: it was the first hovercraft crossing. Christopher Cockerell , the hovercraft\u2019s inventor, accompanied by a pilot and navigator, made the crossing on 25 July 1959; the craft had previously been demonstrated in the Solent on 11 July. SR-N1 is in the Science Museum\u2019s collection and is stored at our Wroughton site. Here it is at Calais, before the maiden crossing.", "But Cockerell\u2019s own hovercraft had flown some four years previously. Having acquired a small shipyard on the Norfolk Broads, Cockerell experimented with the improvised kit before completing an experimental prototype model (using model aircraft-type construction of nylon or silk over balsa wood with a glow-plug model aero engine) which he tested by tethering it to a rowing boat at his yard and flying it around. This prototype is also in the museum\u2019s collection and is on show in the Flight gallery .", "Hovercrafts have never really fulfilled the promise held out for them in the \u201950s, apart from some ferry routes and niche uses such as military assault vehicles. Owing largely to their aircraft ancestry they have high manufacture, maintenance and fuel costs, the latter of particular concern now as we look to cut down on fuel use in transportation.", "Still, it did lead to the hover mower. It\u2019s said that lawnmower technician Karl Dahlman saw a picture of SR-N1 in flight and had the idea of applying its principles to lawncare.

She had a heavy scent to her, like salt water.\u2019 (p. 63)", "Researching and writing a PhD thesis is a stressful and isolating experience in any circumstances: imposter syndrome is rife (the often unspoken and erroneous feeling that you aren\u2019t good enough to complete your studies and sooner or later someone is going to find that out), and I don\u2019t know of any recent students that have not experienced some level of mental health crisis .", "For Wallace, those feelings are compounded by the additional isolation which he feels as a result of who he is. Wallace is a queer black man in a particularly white part of the United States. This means that the already difficult pressures of social situations, work-place politics, and negotiating with your peers and seniors carry with them the added barbs of casual (or in some cases, overt) racism and homophobia.", "Normal postgraduate anxieties and the recent death of his father dredging up memories and feelings of his home in Alabama, a lifestyle and circumstances he is not eager to have to return to, Wallace is already conflicted about whether a PhD in biochemistry is really for him.", "Taylor\u2019s narrative clings tightly to Wallace\u2019s train of thought as he grapples with these feelings, difficult enough for anyone, whilst simultaneously being made to feel that he doesn\u2019t fit into his lab because of his skin colour. When his supervisor or fellow students question whether he belongs there, and after one of his experiments fails under potentially suspicious circumstances, he cannot know if they are articulating his genuine self-doubt or their own racist presumptions.", "For example, early on Wallace describes the makeup of his academic cohort:", "\u2018Their class had been the first small one in quite some time, and the first in more than three decades to include a black person. In his less generous moments, Wallace thought these two things related, that a narrowing, a reduction in the number of applicants, had made his admission possible.\u2019 (p. 8)", "Reading this book in the context of this blogpost raises a lot of questions about who we encourage to pursue scientific fields. 7.6% of UK domiciled students enrolled at UK universities are black, roughly in line with the population figures for University-age students, and entry levels for STEM subjects are similarly proportional. However black students are more likely to enroll at universities with focuses on teaching rather than the more research-led Russell Group institutions which are normally considered more prestigious.", "Partly as a result of this, black students are almost 50% less likely to advance to studying for a postgraduate research qualification such as a PhD within 5 years of graduation than their white peers.", "However, Real Life also made me think about the other side of the equation: the white students and professors who are either institutionally or openly racist in their interactions with Wallace, why is the University system accommodating them without hesitation?", "Away from the science and studies (although as any PhD student will tell you, it is always lurking in the background of your mind), Wallace\u2019s weekend is spent negotiating social situations which are similarly tinged by the preconceived notions of race, class, and sexuality. The novel\u2019s writing is sensual, provocative and at times troubling as Wallace embarks on a new sexual (and potentially, romantic) relationship with one of his peers and wrestles his loneliness even whilst surrounded by people who consider themselves his friends or in the arms of a lover.", "This is a novel which, as the title suggests, is very true to the everyday experience of many people in the scientific community. It is also a novel about how scary academic life can be. Much like the work of a writer like Sally Rooney, it is also about how isolating it can be to be young, and about the challenges of love. It is a book that feels thoroughly American yet also universal. It is a novel about science, but it is also a mirror on society.", "For me, it is a book that brought up a lot of emotions and gave me plenty to think about. It has some beautiful moments that charmed me with their prose and others that made me uncomfortable but that I will be thinking about for years to come. I would love to hear what you thought of it too.", "Whether you\u2019re an occasional reader or an avid bookworm, we would love to hear your thoughts on the text, you can reach us online by using #SMBookClub."]},

Though these machines sound like something out of a steampunk novel, there is growing interest in reviving analogue computers as conventional computing is pushed to its limits.", "Today, with Peter Coveney of University College London, I highlight the growing interest in analogue computing in a paper in a special issue of the Royal Society Journal, Philosophical Transactions A , which focuses on the critical role of reproducibility in computational science.", "In an accompanying Royal Society blog , I describe how analogue computing has a role to play in ensuring we can trust computers, given the increasing use of \u2018digital twins\u2019 to carry out virtual tests in engineering, computer models to simulate pandemics and shape public health policy , climate simulation, computer aided drug design, automated diagnosis, the virtual human project and more.", "One famous example of this first generation of computer \u2013my favourite \u2013\u00a0 was created by economist Bill Phillips in 1949. It might sound crude but, using taps and valves and by observing the resulting flows of water in the Phillip\u2019s Economic Computer , trainee economists at the London School of Economics learned how to model the British economy.", "On the second floor of the Science Museum are two more analogue machines, \u00a0both \u2018differential analysers\u2019 developed at the University of Manchester by the English mathematician and physicist Douglas Hartree (1897-1958), which have been studied in doctoral research by Tom Ritchie of the University of Kent, written up for the Science Museum Group Journal .", "The principles of these mechanical calculating machines were glimpsed long before, in the nineteenth century, by William Thomson, Lord Kelvin, and his brother James. Together, they designed the first general-purpose analogue computer capable of solving differential equations, used across scientific research to model change. \u00a0Their \u2018differential analyser\u2019 represented a way to \u2018mechanise calculus\u2019 but Victorian technology was not sufficiently advanced to turn their ideas into reality.", "Decades later, in the late 1920s, Vannevar Bush and Harold Hazen at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, near Boston, succeeded. Their differential analyser couples \u2018integrators\u2019 , \u00a0each of which is a large glass disc rotated by an electric motor that drives a smaller spinning metal wheel, where its speed of rotation depends on how far it is placed, by a carriage, from the centre of the disc. The rotation of this metal wheel on the glass disc represented the point of integration of an equation. With these spinning components, the mathematical process of integration could be carried out.", "During a visit to MIT in 1933, Hartree found himself gawping at the latest version of Bush\u2019s differential analyser, a room full of gears and shafts driven by electric motors.\u00a0The visitor joked that the machine looked as if \u2018someone had been enjoying himself with an extra-large Meccano set\u2019, the popular children\u2019s construction toy of the day.", "Sure enough, on his return to the United Kingdom, Hartree got hold of Meccano with his research student, Arthur Porter, so they could build their own version at a fraction of the cost. It took 18 months but the result boosted the accuracy and speed of resolving equations for fluid mechanics compared to the traditional computer of that day \u2013 a person, usually female.", "Though he told Meccano magazine the differential analyser \u2018exceeded all expectations\u2019, Ritchie has reproduced Hartree\u2019s machine and found \u2018it breaks down constantly.\u2019 Even so, \u00a0its spinning wheels bring mathematics to life. Bonita Lawrence, who worked with Arthur Porter before his death in 2010, has been building differential analysers at Marshall University since 2007 to help her students visualise calculus.", "The success of this Meccano model led Hartree to construct (not from Meccano) a larger differential analyser, known as the Manchester machine, which could be used to solve many problems, from the electronic structure of atoms to power distribution across electrical networks. They could also help with railway train timetables, generate anti-aircraft and ballistics trajectories, and calculate pension fund derivatives.", "Many analogue machines were built in the United Kingdom before the Second World War. Three of these computers \u2013 the Manchester machine and two differential analysers built at the University of Cambridge \u2013 were used during the war for a variety of applications, according to Ritchie, such as the development of GEE (a precursor to radar), the Magnetron (both projects were led by Phyllis Nicholson and the rest of Hartree\u2019s team at the University of Manchester), as well as the Tube Alloys Project (the British equivalent of the Manhattan Project), where these analogue computers were used by Rudolf Peierls and Otto Frisch to determine the decay rate of Uranium-235 isotopes.", "In the mid-twentieth century, digital computers began to be adopted and, by the late 1970s had taken over from analogue. However, digital computing, for all its advantages, rests on manipulating binary numbers and, because these are rounded, there are concerns about the fidelity with which digital can simulate reality. \u2018With colleagues at Tufts University in America, I did a study that suggests that the behaviour of the real world is richer than any digital computer can capture ,\u2019 comments Peter Coveney. \u2018Here analogue computers offer advantages over digital, along with much lower power consumption.\u2019", "One such effort to create a new generation of analogue computers can be found in the Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania, coincidentally the birthplace of ENIAC, the pioneering digital general-purpose\u00a0computer, by Nader Engheta, along with colleagues in Texas and Italy.", "I first came across Nader\u2019s research in 2005 , when discussing what he then called \u2018transparency\u2019 in metamaterials, today known as cloaking. Metamaterials (\u2018meta\u2019 from the Greek, meaning \u2018beyond\u2019) are designer materials that can be built to have unnatural properties to manipulate light. Around that time he had what he describes as a \u2018very crazy idea\u2019 to develop metamaterials into basic circuit elements at the nanoscale, which he called nanoinductors, nanocapacitors and nanoresistors, but for optics, not electronics.", "By 2012, Engheta had demonstrated these optical circuit elements for information processing. However, two years later showed how, instead of using bulky lenses and optics, a metamaterial measuring a light wavelength thick could perform a suite of mathematical functions.", "Rather than turning information into ones and zeros, as in a conventional computer, Engheta encoded the input in the form of the complex shape of the light wave. The tailored properties of the metamaterial \u2013 notably the profile of its refractive index, along with magnetic and electric properties \u2013 shapes how this wave propagates and the engineers could craft this wave to do something mathematically useful, such as solve particular equations, as the light wave passes through the metamaterial.", "His team demonstrated a proof-of-concept experiment using microwaves, where the long wavelength of this electromagnetic radiation allowed for an easier-to-construct metamaterial device at much bigger length scales (microwaves wavelengths are around 30 centimetres to one millimetre).\u00a0They were able to solve equations using what they call the \u2018Swiss cheese\u2019, a two-square-feet block of polystyrene plastic with a precise and specific distribution of air holes.", "The pattern of holes in the Swiss cheese was predetermined to solve an integral equation with a given \u2018kernel\u2019, the key part of the equation that describes the relationship between two variables. After the microwave propagates through this \u2018cheese\u2019 and its air holes, the solution is found in the shape, intensity, and phase of the exiting wave, for any given input waves as the input function for the integral equation.", "This month, Engheta reported another \u2018Swiss cheese\u2019 that can handle two different integral equations simultaneously (using two microwave frequencies). He told me that \u2018this work shows that metamaterials have the promise of making analogue computing as parallel processor/parallel computing.\u2019", "Light waves would behave in a similar way but, because of their smaller wavelength, can be scaled down to a few microns, a fraction of the thickness of a human hair. An interconnected cluster of these devices could form an analogue computer chip that requires no digital computation. Engheta and his colleagues are currently working on a photonic chip a few microns across.", "By using metamaterials that can alter their properties, it might also be possible to program these devices, said Engheta, likening this to the way that laser light was used to write information on old-fashioned CDs. He is investigating another approach, using the Mach-Zehnder interferometer, named after two 19 th century physicists, when a source of microwaves is split into two halves and then recombined so the beams interfere. By stringing these interferometers and altering the phase of the light going through them, it is possible to implement any kernel, offering another way to program these devices to do what Engheta calls \u2018photonic calculus\u2019.", "Engheta believes that it may be possible to consider analogue photonic chips \u2013 high-speed, ultra-small, and very-low-power \u2013 as subsystems of the next generation of computer, so called exascale computers capable of performing a million million million operations per second \u00a0(your laptop or desktop is likely capable of several teraflops, or several million million calculations per second) where power consumption \u2013 predicted to be 60 megawatts in the case of the Aurora exascale computer in Illinois \u2013 is now becoming a problem, along with how to keep these behemoths cool.", "In recent months, a Chinese team demonstrated a remarkable analogue optical quantum computer, Jiuzhang , which took minutes to do what a conventional supercomputer would take billions of years to complete .\u00a0 It could be that, in years to come, computers will increasingly rely on dancing beams of light."]},

Whilst she was there, she decided to pursue a career in astronomy. Opportunities for women in scientific academia were almost non-existent in England, so she decided to move to Harvard, USA.", "In 1925, Payne completed her PhD at Harvard College Observatory for her work on the temperatures of stars and their chemical make up. During her research she discovered that the Sun was mostly made of hydrogen and helium.", "However, this result conflicted with current understanding which stated that the Sun had a similar chemical make-up to the Earth. As such, she was persuaded to reject her findings by Henry Norris Russell, a leading astronomer of the day. He declared her results to be \u2018clearly impossible\u2019, although he admitted that her doctoral dissertation was the best he had ever read. In fact, it was so good that it was published as a book, Stellar Atmospheres !", "In 1929, Payne was proved right by Russell himself who finally agreed with her results and cited her study \u2013 although he made no mention to his earlier disbelief.", "In 1927 Payne became a fully-fledged Astronomer working at Harvard Observatory. She instructed graduate students and supervised doctoral research but was still denied an academic position, in spite of the fact that the Director of the Observatory, Harlow Shapley, believed she deserved one. This was due to the misogynistic views of the Harvard President, Abbott Lowell, who refused to appoint her and swore that she would never ascend to a Harvard professorship while he was still alive.", "In 1938, under the leadership of a new President, Payne was finally recognised as an officer of Harvard, as the Philips Astronomer, although she was still denied the position of Professor even though she was more than qualified. Indeed, Shapley had needed to reassure Harvard that conferring the Philips Astronomer title on a woman would not make her a member of the college faculty.", "Finally, in the late 1950s Cecilia Payne became a full professor and Chair of the Department of Astronomy \u2013 the first woman at Harvard to achieve this level of success and become a Head of Department. She celebrated by sending handwritten letters to all the female astronomy students and inviting them to a party in the Observatory Library. However, despite this success Payne was still paid less than her male equivalents across Harvard. A gender pay gap issue that still exists today.", "In 1933, Payne and her future-husband Sergei Gaposchkin met each other for the first time in Germany. He had travelled 150 miles on a bicycle to greet her and ask her for her help. Gaposchkin was one of ten children born to poor parents in the Crimea. He had worked on fishing boats, farms and in factories to finally realise his dream of becoming an astronomer. However due to the political situation at the time and the rise of the Nazis he was under suspicion in Germany of being a Russian spy, and had been denied entry into Russia under suspicion of being a German spy. Payne solved this problematic situation by helping him get a visa to the USA and a position at the Harvard Observatory.", "After working together at the Observatory, they fell in love and eloped to New York, where they were married. When the news was announced back in Harvard it was met with some shock as no one knew that a romance had been developing.

He even claimed that it could be used by up to 20 people before flushing!", "Harington had one installed at his home in Bath and later installed a working model for the Queen in Richmond Palace, but it clearly didn\u2019t catch on.

Whilst Cumming\u2019s S-pipe helped reduce smells, the valves that released water to push out waste still fell short.", "One of the most influential improvements was made by inventor and locksmith Joseph Bramah. His design, patented in 1778, improved upon Cumming\u2019s by adding a hinged valve . It became one of the leading designs for the next century.", "Until the 1850s, London\u2019s waste removal mainly consisted of cesspits beneath houses or ditches that led waste into the Thames. Many communities outside of London had their own independent drainage systems.", "Flushing toilets remained a luxury well into the 20 th century, with non-flushing options such as outdoor \u2018Earth closets\u2019 especially popular in more rural areas.", "This type of toilet was patented in 1860 by Reverend Henry Moule, specifically to provide a more sanitary option for households without indoor piping. It releases clay to cover the waste and is similar to \u2018composting\u2019 public toilets often found at festivals and public events today.", "Homeowners had been responsible for dealing with their own waste since a ruling of Henry VIII\u2019s in the late 1500s.\u00a0The British Government\u2019s Public Health Act of 1848 transferred this responsibility into the care of local health boards, enacting that all new homes (and re-builds) should be equipped with a \u2018means of drainage\u2019.", "This was the beginning of a commitment to centralise responsibility for public sanitation and the first stage in the creation of the sewer systems we so heavily rely on today.", "However, the \u2018means of drainage\u2019 continued to empty waste into water sources, many of which were used for washing and drinking. This created issues, especially in the increasingly densely populated London, which were compounded with the rising popularity of flushing toilets.", "The \u2018Great Stink\u2019 of 1858, when the smell got so bad that Parliament closed, and increasing outbreaks of water-borne diseases such as Cholera , forced the British government to act.", "A 16-year sanitation project began very quickly that same year, with railway engineer Joseph Bazalgette at the helm. Over a thousand miles of drainage pipes were installed under the streets of London, feeding into 82 miles of sewers that led to 4 pumping stations across London via 6 \u2018interceptor\u2019 sewers.", "This huge engineering feat that funnelled waste 8 miles downstream of the city, into the water source of less populated areas. Bazalgette\u2019s brick lined sewers remain the foundation of today\u2019s sewer system.", "Right in the midst of this sanitary revolution, J.G. Jennings installed the first flushing public loos \u2013 or as he named them, \u2018Monkey closets\u2019 at the Great Exhibition. Known as a pioneer of sanitary science, Jennings also contributed to improving the flushing lavatory, patenting improvements to Bramah\u2019s design in 1852 with a wash-out design that remained one of the most popular toilets throughout the century.", "By the 1870s, the sanitary business was booming. There were multiple popular toilet designs made by a number of companies across the UK, but they all had limitations.", "The wash-out toilet had complaints of noise, an insufficient, often failing flush and a tendency to splatter. Its popularity has been put down to the abundance of patented add-ons and improvements.", "In 1870, Stevens Hellyer created the Optimus in an attempt to improve upon some of these complaints by improving the flushing mechanism.", "Another innovator of the flushing bog was Thomas Twyford.", "Twyford had been in the sanitaryware business since 1849, and his company still exists today as Twyford Bathrooms . During his career he also made improvements to Bramah\u2019s design, as well as created a number of wash-out models, starting with the National in 1871.", "In 1883 Twyford made a move away from metal and wood designs towards porcelain with the first one-piece porcelain loo, the Unitas. This design meant that the unit could be kept entirely clean. It also had the selling point of a hinged seat, so it could also function as a male urinal.", "Before this, the toilet bowl had been entirely separate and a wooden enclosure was required to provide a seat. This was a direct improvement on Jennings\u2019 wash-out closet, and Twyford continued to refine it throughout his life.", "At this point, you may be wondering where Thomas Crapper comes into our story.", "He clearly didn\u2019t invent the toilet and this misconception may be due to his questionable advertising practices, which implied the invention of the Syphonic flush was his own.\u00a0In fact, this significant contribution to the toilet was invented in the early 1800s (and patented in 1819) by the little known Albert Giblin.", "Crapper took this design more than half a century later and popularised it, succeeding in taking the credit for its invention too. His royally warranted sanitary equipment company was the largest in the UK, and the first to utilise a showroom for mass-produced toiletry wares in 1870, further popularising in-house sanitation and toilet installation.", "Crapper did invent several toilet add-ons, most notably adapting Cummings\u2019 \u2018S-pipe\u2019 into the modern day \u2018U-bend\u2019. He held 9 patents, including the revolutionary ballcock and the unsuccessful \u2018self-rising seat\u2019.", "His connection with the phrase \u2018crapper\u2019 was coincidental, as \u2018crap\u2019 had been used in relation to waste long before his lifetime. However, it is likely that the connection to toilets and excrement was strengthened and popularised with the size and success of his company, and \u2018crapper\u2019 branding emblazoned across all his products.", "Toilets have even been adapted to work in under the low gravity conditions found when orbiting planet Earth.\u00a0This space toilet design was used onboard Russian Soyuz spacecraft.", "Astronaut Clayton C. Anderson shared his experience of using this type of toilet onboard a Soyuz spacecraft in 2007. Anderson is one of a small number of astronauts to have used a space toilet onboard four different spacecraft (a Soyuz, the International Space Station and Space Shuttles Atlantis and Discovery).", "Like many inventions, the toilet was developed by numerous additions and adjustments over time, with no single \u2018inventor\u2019 who could claim the title. It is up for debate which designs were most significant and influential.", "There are many historic innovations we\u2019ve not included here, as well as endless modern innovations such as Japan\u2019s hi-tech loos (some which even play music!) and waterless toilets (which you can see on display in Medicine: The Wellcome Galleries ).", "Sadly flushing toilets continue to be a luxury in many parts of the world.

Faraday attended Humphrey Davy\u2019s lectures at the Royal Institution while training as a bookbinder. After Davy damaged his eyes in an explosion during his chemical research, Faraday was recommended to him as an amanuensis (assistant) in 1813.", "Shortly after this one of Davy\u2019s assistants was dismissed for striking another colleague and Faraday took up the position. Faraday worked for Davy until the latter\u2019s death in 1829, with their relationship oscillating between patronage and exploitation. Davy put Faraday to work on several projects that would utilise his talent; the founding of the Athenaeum Club attempts to improve optical glass and the protection of the copper bottoms of naval vessels from corrosion while at sea.", "Faraday was frustrated with the amount of time these projects consumed and the lack of practical success. In the 1830s Faraday was widely regarded as Davy\u2019s successor in both scientific and public life and he was fully committed to the encouragement of state utilisation of science. Providing advice on a wide range of topics from lighthouses to art restoration, Faraday defined state interaction with scientific knowledge during a profoundly formative-era for state-science relations. The formally employed scientific advisor to the government, the Astronomer Royal George Airy, told Faraday \u201cwe trouble you as a universal referee or a character-counsel on all matters of science.\u201d", "Despite the absorption of his time on tasks and experiments set by Davy,", "Faraday built up his reputation as a chemist at the start of his career. In the late 1810s Faraday conducted important metallurgical work on improving steel alloys with the surgical instruments-maker James Stodart. Faraday and Stodart addressed themselves to the specific question of \u2018artificially\u2019 improving cutting edges and decreasing corrosion by adding alloys to steel.", "A few years after this work, Faraday isolated and identified benzene in June 1825 from the oily residue derived from the production of illuminating gas, giving it the name bicarburet of hydrogen. Benzene is a significant chemical, used in the manufacture of more complex hydrocarbons to produce plastics, of which billions of kilograms are made today.", "Faraday\u2019s alloys and chemical samples are all kept in his chemical chest and is one of the treasure of the Science Museum Group\u2019s collection. It also contains gifts to Faraday from other chemists. William Hyde Wollaston who discovered the elements palladium and rhodium sent samples of these to Faraday, who stored them with his own metallurgical samples.", "These precious metals offered to Faraday are held by the museum in our safe and include platinum coins from Russia, samples of cadmium and crystals of Bismuth which were also all owned by Faraday. On display in the Making the Modern World gallery there is a bar of aluminium given to Faraday by Napoleon III. Until the electrolytic process for its extraction was discovered, aluminium was an expensive curiosity and used to make expensive jewellery.", "Faraday\u2019s life has always been regarded as highly romantic in its rise from humble origins to a hero of scientific endeavour, his eminent discoveries and intellectual labours have become classical in their simplicity, perfection and universal significance. The chemical chest and other items belonging to Faraday were bequeathed to the Museum in 1908 and 1911 by members of his family and were displayed as relics of Faraday\u2019s life and work.", "There is a noble tradition of science biography stretching back to the 1600s and there has been a recent revival in biography as a historical practice both in universities and museums. But while curators are keen to feed a fresh hunger to understand the making of science through the making of scientists, we should always be cautious in how we come to remember and beatify scientific-lives.", "The history of science is filled with fantastic individuals and their narratives are fascinating. Yet focusing too much on the heroes of science can blind us to contributions of assistants and technicians, something that Faraday himself would surely have been keenly aware of."]},

At first, she began by assisting her husband with his research but soon she took over the research herself.", "Thereafter, she made notable contributions to the development and understanding of the electric arc, an early and powerful form of electric lighting.", "Ayrton established two key points in relation to the working of electric arcs. Firstly, she discovered that the problems with electric arc lighting such as hissing, flickering and instability were the result of oxygen coming into contact with the carbon rods used to create the arc.", "Secondly, Ayrton discovered that when oxygen was excluded, a steady arc was obtained and hence she was able to establish a linear relationship between arc length, pressure, and potential difference, the \u2018Ayrton equation\u2019.", "Between 1895 and 1896, Ayrton published a series of twelve articles on her analysis, research and technical advances in the field of electric arc lighting in The Electrician , the premier electrical engineering periodical of the age. With these articles, she overtook her husband\u2019s earlier work in this field and established her own credentials as an expert on the workings of the electric arc and in the field of electrical engineering more generally.", "This recognition led to increased opportunities including the invitation to deliver her own paper on electric arcs before the Institution of Electrical Engineers (IEE, now IET). She was the first woman to read her own paper before this prestigious engineering society.", "In 1899, Ayrton was elected a member of the institution (MIEE), a prestigious and widely recognised professional qualification.\u00a0 Thus, Ayrton became the first female member of the IEE and the first professionally recognised female electrical engineer.", "Ayrton\u2019s research interests were broad and at the turn of the twentieth century, her interests turned to researched water and air vortices, resulting in a life-saving application used during the First World War.", "After the German Army first used poison gas at the Second Battle of Ypres in April 1915, many British scientists quickly began to adapt their research to counteracting this new and deadly weapon.

The V-2 was the harbinger of the Cold War\u2019s missile age and the four minute warning.", "The V-2\u2019s guidance was innovatory \u2013 it employed a system of gyroscopes that registered any deviation in flight \u2013 but by today\u2019s standards the missile\u2019s accuracy was very poor. Most landed kilometres off target. Nevertheless, it was clear to many that this new weapon represented a future of strategic warfare; one in which far more powerful missiles mated to nuclear warheads would cover intercontinental distances on the way to their targets. To others it signalled the dawning of a space age when still bigger rockets would counter the pull of gravity and place satellites in orbits around the Earth.", "After the war the Allies acquired the V2 technology and many of the rocket programme\u2019s leading scientists and engineers. The Soviets constructed their own version at the start of a research programme that led eventually their own R-7 rocket which put Sputnik \u2013 the world\u2019s first artificial satellite \u2013 into orbit.", "The Americans took many surplus V-2s along with the rocket programme\u2019s technical director Wernher von Braun.

It killed three people and destroyed a row of houses.

In a grotesque irony the V-2 killed many more in the course of its manufacture by slave labour from the Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp in central Germany.", "The final V-2 landed south of London in Orpington on March 27, 1945 killing one person \u2013 the last civilian fatality of the war in mainland Britain.", "For more information, visit the Science Museum\u2019s Making the Modern World gallery, where a full size V-2 rocket can be seen on display."]},

Consequently, in 1958 the Home Office necessitated that the following notice be mounted on each machine near the viewing point: \u2018Repeated exposure to X-rays may be harmful. It is unwise for customers to have more than twelve shoe-fitting exposures a year.\u2019 In the same year, the Medical Research Council published this statement: \u2018We hope that the use of X-rays in shoe-fitting will be abandoned except when prescribed for orthopaedic reasons.\u2019", "Despite the awareness of the health risks of the Pedoscope, it was not until the 1970s that the Pedoscope faded from view.

It was time, I decided, to seek some expert help.", "Several members of the British Vintage Wireless Society (BVWS) were already pencilled in to pay a visit to the Museum to look at the radios in our collection. It seemed like the perfect opportunity to recruit a few of them to work more closely with us. We knew we wanted to display one star object from the collection \u2013 the 2LO transmitter, which transmitted the very first BBC radio broadcasts in 1922. In addition we have a large collection of radio receivers from the 1920s and 1930s. What we were missing was a range of fascinating stories to help us choose between all those radios. We invited the members of the BVWS to help us select the stories that represented their experience and knowledge of vintage radios.", "Five of the group offered their time, and I worked with a colleague to plan a series of four sessions for them. Over the course of the sessions the group got to know our collections and gradually built up their own set of criteria for selecting radio equipment. We asked them to arrive at a list of three objects each, meaning we would have a total of fifteen radio receivers as a long-list to work with.", "As well as gathering a list of objects we were keen to collect stories about the historical impact of radios on everyday life. We also hoped to find out what led the members of the BVWS to be so enthusiastic about and enthralled with vintage radio equipment. They have a strong emotional attachment to these objects that would be brilliant to share with our visitors. We spent one of the four sessions at the British Vintage Wireless and Television Museum which holds an amazing collection of radios and televisions inside the walls of an innocent looking house in South London. While we were there, surrounded by all the fantastic objects in the museum, we interviewed some of the group and asked them about what got them collecting in the first place.", "By the end of the four sessions we had a successfully arrived at a list of objects to display alongside the 2LO transmitter, together with stories to support them. One of the more unexpected items to make it onto the list was a ceramic mixing bowl selected by Lorne Clark. He told us how his mother, who had lived near a large transmitter, would place a pair of headphones in a mixing bowl in order to amplify the sound from a crystal radio set and make group listening possible.", "The sessions were great fun and I certainly learned a lot about early radio from the group, and much more quickly and enjoyably than if I had been left to my own devices. Inviting outside groups to add their own expertise to the knowledge held by a museum and its curators can add a richness and variety to displays \u2013 especially as personal stories such as Lorne\u2019s are often missing from a museum\u2019s formal historic collections. Hopefully all of the BVWS members we worked with enjoyed their experience and gained an interesting insight into how a large museum goes about developing exhibition displays. I\u2019m positive they enjoyed looking at our objects in storage because persuading them to leave the storeroom at the end of a session was always something of a challenge."]},

Early films like this one had a frightening effect on people because of their novelty \u2013 it was unlike anything they had experienced before.", "A hundred and twenty years of cinema history later and we have become very used the medium of film, so that a sequence of a train pulling into a station is unlikely to carry the same impact (although more recent advances in 3D technology and motion simulation as featured in the Science Museum\u2019s IMAX and Discovery Motion Theatre might come closer to simulating the original shock of the Lumi\u00e8re brothers\u2019 film!).", "The innovative photographic techniques displayed in Revelations may have lost their novelty but viewing these photographs today it is hard to deny how striking and effective they still are as images.", "Why is this?", "Certainly it helps that the exhibition frames them in terms of their historical significance, which makes their innovative aspect clear. The remarkable aesthetic quality of these early photographs is also important to consider, and this is especially evident when you see them alongside art photography (the great originality of this exhibition).", "The photographs taken by Edgerton during his time at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology demonstrate a visual sensibility in their complementary pastel backgrounds and Alfred Ehrhardt and Carl Str\u00fcwe\u2019s photomicrographs show an interest in the \u2018abstract beauty\u2019 of microstructures.", "No doubt the experiments in photography being carried out today and shared online to vast audiences will soon lose their initial \u2018novelty\u2019 impact. Whether their value as striking and \u2018revelatory\u2019 images will last, however, is a question for future generations.", "", "Adam Stoneman is an Explainer at the Science Museum.", "Revelations: Experiments in Photography is at Media Space until 13 September 2015.

The Polish Lutheran astronomer Johannes Hevelius (1611\u20131689) also shows a darkened room in an engraving \u2013 a technique that he himself mastered- to illustrate how to safely observe the Sun and eclipses. \u2018It is a striking image and very important in the history of science,\u2019 says Blatchford.", "By the eighteenth century, research on our local star began in earnest, notably by Edmond Halley, whose studies of an eclipse in 1715 represent a pioneering example of citizen science, and who also reported the phenomenon of Baily\u2019s Beads (named after Francis Baily who in 1836 observed how beads of sunlight lingered along the edge of the Moon in an annular eclipse).", "The eerie and evocative image of the eclipse became democratised too. Once only depicted for churches, royal patrons and scholarly tomes, eclipses began to feature in the popular science books of the day, such as Astronomy Explained (1757) by the Scottish Astronomer James Ferguson.", "They were also used to humorous effect in a satirical print in which General Wellington is shown eclipsing the monarch George IV (An Eclipse Lately Discovered in the Georgium Sidus), to shed light on a spat over the emancipation of Catholics.", "The Science Museum\u2019s extensive collections of guides, models and pamphlets show how tracking and observing eclipses became a fad in the early nineteenth century. \u2018There was burgeoning middle class interest in science at that time when people at polite dinner parties\u00a0 talked about what they got up to with telescope as much as literature,\u2019 says Blatchford.", "All the while, scientific observations became ever more detailed. The Kew Photoheliograph was the first astronomical instrument designed for photographing celestial objects and was used in Northern Spain to photograph the 1860 total eclipse , helping to resolve the debate as to whether prominences were intrinsic to the Sun or atmospheric effects.", "Yet, remarks Blatchford, \u2018the artist remained a valued part of the professional eclipse expedition.\u2019 One example is to be found in the \u2018glorious chromolithographs\u2019 of a total eclipse in Wyoming in 1878, produced by Etienne Trouvelot which are \u2018all the more remarkable when compared with an \u2018accurate\u2019 modern digital photography.\u2019", "The view of this cosmic event that Trouvelot recorded during his experience of a few minutes of totality is as rich as some digital composite images. Comparison shows them to be \u2018so alike that it takes your breath away,\u2019 says Blatchford: the active combination of eye and brain is powerful when compared to the passive collection of light through a lens.", "Even in the 20 th century, artists still made a contribution. American portrait painter Howard Russell Butler was invited to paint the 1918 eclipse by the US Naval Observatory, for example. A series of his paintings supported the growing consensus among researchers that a luminous area encircling the darkened body of the Sun\u2014the corona\u2014was the Sun\u2019s atmosphere. \u2018For a long time it was thought the corona was part of the moon\u2019s atmosphere,\u2019 explains Blatchford.", "Eventually, however, \u2018the sheer quality of photography came to supplant the role of artist as essential companion of the astronomer; and so the eclipse was used by artists in new guises, both symbolic and abstract.\u2019", "Around turn of the 20 th century, eclipse art became prophetic. In an illustration produced for On the Moon, written in 1887 by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky , Russian scientist and pioneer of the cosmist movement , one can witness a solar eclipse like no other seen before by human eyes: the Earth eclipsing the Sun.", "A solar eclipse makes a sombre appearance in work of the Russian symbolist painter Nicholas Roerich in his Prince Igor\u2019s Campaign of 1942, which Blatchford argues is a reference to Russian armies marching east to confront a Europe eclipsed by Nazism.", "Towards the end of the 20 th century, depictions became more playful, such as one by Roy Lichtenstein who depicted time-lapsed versions in his Eclipse of the Sun II. When it comes to the future, however, Blatchford says that \u2018painting an eclipse on a canvas will probably fade away with the rise of digital.\u2019", "The Science Museum is now planning a major exhibition about the Sun in 2018. It is remarkable, says Blatchford, how this central feature of everyday life has been neglected in modern culture.", "Ian Blatchford\u2019s richly-illustrated paper was first presented at an \u2018eclipse festival\u2019 to coincide with the last solar eclipse visible in the UK, in March 2015, organised by Giles Harrison, Professor of Atmospheric Physics at Reading University.", "Harrison said that eclipses played a key role in the history of science, from the rise of citizen science in 1715, when Edmund Halley used Philosophical Transactions to ask colleagues across the country to help him observe a total solar eclipse (Harrison organised a meteorological citizen science experiment, NEWEx , which provided data despite the cloudy weather in 2015), to the use of an eclipse of Jupiter\u2019s moon Io to make the first estimate of the speed of light, to Sir Arthur Eddington\u2019s famous test of the bending of starlight predicted by Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity during the 1919 solar eclipse.", "In his paper on \u2018eclipse meteorology\u2019, Harrison recounts how the predictable decline in solar radiation in these natural experiments, when day turns into night and temperatures drop, can help weigh up how the atmosphere responds to an external stimulus on a regional scale (10\u20131000 km). This work is invaluable for honing weather prediction models, and can be used to help plan for transient reductions in renewable electricity generation too."]},

Through this contemplation of the mechanics and possible mechanisation of musical instruments, the question ultimately arises as to why music is still almost exclusively made by humans for other humans. This was not a question that was lost on the clockwork virtuosi of the 17th century. A notable example are Jacques de Vaucanson\u2019s musical robots, the first of which was a life-sized flautist who could play 12 melodies and are perhaps the most celebrated.

Each era of the soundscape is composed and programmed in such a way to foreground some of the most pertinent technological developments of the time and their repercussions for sound and music.

His team at the Medical Research Council\u2019s Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge has uncovered key details of this protein-making factory, life\u2019s oldest and most universal assembly of molecules, paving the way for his 2009 Nobel Prize in chemistry.", "The ribosome needs various ingredients to turn genes into flesh and blood: a messenger RNA molecule, which carries the instructions for making a protein from the cellular storehouse of genetic information, held in the form of DNA. To turn this messenger RNA code into protein, the ribosome harnesses a second type of RNA \u2013 transfer RNA \u2013 which carries the building blocks of proteins, called amino acids.", "Like a tape reader, the ribosome reads messenger RNA, a sequence of four \u201cletters\u201d (chemicals, called bases) that spells out the recipe of a protein. The chemical machinery in the ribosome takes this sequence, three letters at a time, and matches it to three letters on each transfer RNA, lining up their cargo of amino acids in the proper order, then stitches them together to build the protein.", "Venki (though he has been knighted, he prefers not to be called Sir Venki) told me how his team competed to find the rhyme and reason of the ribosome against Ada Yonath, who had invested decades in cracking this problem, and Thomas Steitz of Yale University. The competition, which went on to include a fourth group in Santa Cruz, was \u2018stressful\u2019, he admitted, as it became clear that this high-risk project could blight the careers of young researchers who worked with him if it did not deliver.", "They used intense, tuned sources of X-rays from a machine called a synchrotron to interrogate the structure, revealing the location of every last atom. Such studies show how the ribosome is composed of three different RNA molecules and more than 50 different proteins, arranged in two components called the 30S and the 50S subunits. The former is the \u2018brain\u2019 that reads genetic code and the latter the larger \u2018heart\u2019 that makes protein. They drift apart and together, as molecular links are forged and broken, to create the proteins that build and run the body.", "Overall, the ribosome ratchets RNAs laden with amino acids through its heart at a rate of 15 per second to string them together into proteins. \u2018The surprise was how a machine of this size was so precise,\u2019 he said, while showing the Hay audience a video of this soft, deformable micro machine in action.", "This is a remarkable recapitulation of the idea of the body as a machine, an ideas that was first glimpsed centuries ago, as revealed by the Science Museum\u2019s Leonardo exhibition , and in an exhibition about humanoid robots which will open next year.", "Venki told me how new understanding of this marvellous machine\u00a0could help tackle superbugs that are evolving resistance to antibiotics. \u2018It is potentially a huge problem and if we don\u2019t act on it, it will become a major crisis.\u2019", "The ribosome is a big target, relatively speaking, consisting of around half a million atoms and measuring around one millionth of an inch across. The thousands at work in every one of our cells have been honed over aeons.", "Studies, which date back many years , have shown which parts are best targeted by antibiotics. Peer deep inside the ribosome and, like the rings in the trunk of a tree, you can see an ancient core that has been turning instructions into the proteins for the best part of four billion years. This is \u2018where all the action happens\u2019, said Venki.", "This chemical contraption lies at the heart of between two eras of life, one familiar and one shrouded in mystery: the former consists of today\u2019s DNA-based living things and the latter the very first things that multiplied which did not rely on DNA at all.", "This core is an artefact of this earlier era of evolution, when a different kind of life thrived on Earth. It consists of the genetic material RNA, a relic of the so-called \u2018RNA world,\u2019 when living things depended on this more delicate-yet-flexible kind of genetic material which not only stores information but, unlike DNA, can catalyse chemical reactions too.\u00a0Finding this RNA in a ribosome is a bit like discovering a floppy disk, perhaps even a punched card, in a tablet computer.", "When you compare this relic molecular machinery in myriad organisms, you make a startling discovery. \u2018The closer you get to the heart of the ribosome, the more similar,\u2019 says Venki: this ancient RNA is so essential to the process of staying alive that it is almost identical, whatever the creature.", "Whether it belongs to a bacterium or a person, the RNA at the heart of ribosome ceaselessly turns genetic instructions into the protein molecules that build and run a body.", "A rind of proteins evolved around this central RNA machinery to hone its performance and this differs depending on the creature \u2013 our ribosomes are almost twice as large as those of the bugs that infect us, for example.\u00a0It turns out that some antibiotics work by, in effect, throwing a spanner in the works of this machine, targeting bacterial ribosomes while leaving human ribosomes intact so they do not cause side effects. \u2018They bind to bacterial ribosomes, not so well to ours,\u2019 he explained.", "Thanks to this work, deeper insights are emerging that could pave the way to new classes of antibiotics. He told the Hay audience how these are desperately needed as resistance to conventional antibiotics takes hold, though he emphasized (as has the Chief Medical Officer Dame Sally Davies ) that new drugs are not the whole answer \u2013 they must be accompanied by a multifaceted approach, from new diagnostics to regulating their use, not least in agriculture.", "Many antibiotics such as tetracycline and streptomycin work by disrupting the conglomerates of RNA and protein in the ribosome. Venki has investigated how they do this, not least to understand how they fail. For example, some bacteria shatter antibiotic drugs into pieces (this is the cause of penicillin resistance), others add chemical groups to the ribosome, changing the target; mutate to alter the fundamental shape of the ribosome; or expel the antibiotic with molecular pumps. \u2018Eventually, resistance will occur and this is simply a consequence of the fact that bacteria mutate and resistance can be selected for,\u2019 he explained.", "This provides understanding to develop new antibiotics. Tom Steitz has, for example, started a company that has developed several lead compounds that show promise. But it is a slog turning lead compounds into treatments. Venki said that drug companies have difficulty recouping the billion dollar investment when the latest antibiotics have to be reserved for the most resistant infections and, overall, are not as profitable as medications that have to be swallowed day in, day out. There should be better market mechanisms, though he added that Governments also play a key role.", "The path to his Nobel Prize began with his upbringing in India, where his parents taught him that science \u2018is an interesting life.\u2019 After an unpromising start at school, notably when his parents \u2018gave up on me\u2019 between his seventh and ninth grades, a teacher helped kindle his interest in science and mathematics.", "Venki went on to study for a doctorate in physics in Ohio. However, this turned out to be a false start (\u2018I realised that, actually, I was much more interested in biology\u2019). Being relatively young, he decided to start again in graduate school: \u2018I had to go backwards several years.\u2019 Eventually, after gaining a doctorate in biology, he joked how he was lured from America by the \u2018food, salary and weather\u2019 to the LMB in Cambridge, where, most famously, Jim Watson and Francis Crick discovered the double helix structure of DNA.", "While he had worked on parts of the ribosome in the United States, the LMB allowed him to study the molecular machine in its head-spinning entirety. \u2018I had no idea how long that would take.\u2019 The lab \u2018focuses on long term challenges\u2019 and, when it comes to its ten Nobel prizes , they \u2018are simply a fringe benefit\u2019 of its commitment to pure curiosity.

Smeaton\u2019s father encouraged his son to follow him into the legal profession but Smeaton\u2019s childhood interest in taking things apart and putting them back together instead came to the fore. Smeaton had the ability to quickly pick up the technical skills from those around him, to put them into practice and many times to improve them, an early biographer described him as \u201cborn an engineer.\u201d", "Nonetheless his father was concerned that his son wouldn\u2019t be able to make a decent career from his tinkering and engineering ability and so sent him to London in 1742 to pursue an education and career in law.", "Within a few years, Smeaton realised the legal profession was not for him and persuaded his father to support his career as a philosophical (scientific) instrument maker in London in the late 1740s (dates in historic accounts vary). In parallel with Smeaton\u2019s instrument-making career, Smeaton became heavily involved with the Royal Society with one of his early papers, \u201c An Account of some Experiments upon a Machine for measuring the Way of a Ship at Sea \u201d, being submitted in 1753 and read in 1754, and around this time Smeaton\u2019s talents were recognised by becoming a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS).", "Smeaton\u2019s 1753/4 paper, unfortunately lacking illustrations, described the construction and operation of and experimentation with Smeaton\u2019s \u2018whirling speculum\u2019 or horizontal top, essentially a prototype gyroscope or artificial horizon, produced through the use of a spinning top and used for marine navigation. Smeaton\u2019s instrument was based on the earlier work of notable instrument maker George Adams and sea captain John Serson.", "In about 1738, George Adams developed an early artificial horizon , which used a sextant to measure the angle between the sun and its image on a reflective mercury surface.", "A decade later in 1748, Adams described his new sea-quadrant in \u201c The Description and Use of a New Sea-Quadrant \u201d which described two \u201ccurious\u201d methods of creating an artificial horizon: one using a floating mercury mirror (as described above) and another by means of a whirling speculum.", "Meanwhile in 1743, sea captain John Serson developed his own whirling speculum, a spinning top used as a level to locate the horizon in foggy conditions, and is generally credited as the inventor of the whirling speculum as his instrument was most likely constructed and publicised prior to George Adams\u2019 1748 publication mentioned above. However, Serson was unable to further develop his instrument as he was tragically lost at sea on the HMS Victory in 1744.", "In 1751/2, a paper on Serson\u2019s speculum \u201cAn account of an horizontal Top, invented by Mr Serson, by Mr James Short, FRS\u201d was read before the Royal Society; a manuscript transcription of the paper can be found in the Science Museum archives.", "James Short\u2019s brief paper described further development of Serson\u2019s speculum after Serson was lost at sea including Smeaton\u2019s early contributions to understanding the underlying scientific principles and operation of this innovative scientific instrument.", "Considered the inventor and constructor of the best air-pump (vacuum pump) Short had seen, Smeaton was asked to investigate whether air was the cause of the horizontality of the spinning Top, Smeaton\u2019s experiments concluded that this was not the case.", "In 1751, Smeaton developed and tested an improved whirling speculum for marine navigation, based on the research described in Short\u2019s paper as well as Serson\u2019s earlier work.", "Smeaton initially hired a boat on the Serpentine river and later voyaged down to Thames \u201cseveral leagues beyond the Nore\u201d in a small sailing boat. Smeaton went on to further work in this area, collaborating with Dr Gowin Knight (1713-1772) in 1750 and 1751 with tests of Smeaton\u2019s improved whirling speculum as well as a mariner\u2019s compass designed and made by the pair.", "Sea trails of the two instruments took place during a short cruise of HMS Fortune, a sloop of war, in the same year. The trials revealed that Smeaton\u2019s whirling speculum was not useful and had severe problems with accuracy when used in heavy seas.", "Meanwhile, Smeaton\u2019s mariner\u2019s compass, co-developed with Dr Knight, was of sufficient quality to become a Royal Navy standard issue and by 1751 Smeaton moved his instrument business from one part of Holborn, London to another, from Great Turnstile to a larger premises in Furnival Inn Court, and was employing three craftsmen.", "Despite his ultimate lack of success with his whirling speculum, Smeaton\u2019s experimental instrument marked a significant development in artificial horizons and can be considered a prototype of sorts for the modern gyroscope.", "More generally, Smeaton\u2019s experiments and papers before the Royal Society including his 1753/4 paper on his whirling speculum established his credentials as an instrument maker and researcher of renown and innovation.", "By 1753, Smeaton had been made a prestigious Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in recognition of his innovations in marine and scientific instruments as well as his research into the mechanics of waterwheels and windmills.", "Between 1753 and 1756, Smeaton further developed his career: acquiring in an interest in mechanics; taking on a series of small civil engineering projects mostly related to bridges and locks; and touring various \u201chydraulic features\u201d in the Netherlands.", "This combination of skills, research, and experience as well as his varied and innovative approach to instrument making and engineering led to Smeaton being recommended by the Royal Society to design and construct the new Eddystone lighthouse in 1756.", "Smeaton\u2019s Eddystone lighthouse, the third such lighthouse built over a period of 100 years at the dangerous location of Eddystone Rocks located fourteen miles from Plymouth in the English Channel.

Such was the strength of the foundations that when the subsequent fourth and current lighthouse, designed by James Douglass using Robert Stevenson\u2019s developments of Smeaton\u2019s techniques, was constructed on a new site in April 1879, the foundations of Smeaton\u2019s earlier lighthouse, in place for 100 years, were too strong to be removed and so were left in situ .", "Smeaton is credited with being the first person to use the term \u2018civil engineer\u2019 as a title and to differentiate himself from military engineers.", "By 1767, such was Smeaton\u2019s reputation and success, founded upon his many successful civil engineering projects including canals, bridges, harbours, and the Eddystone lighthouse, as well as his strong role in, and many papers before, the Royal Society that he was forced to issue a trade advertising card shown above outlining his limited availability and consulting costs.", "The trade card informed Smeaton\u2019s friends (read customers) that, due to his commitments as a professional civil engineer and his role as Receiver of the Smelt Mill at Langley on Tyne belonging to the Royal Hospital Greenwich, he was unable to be consulted by the public without payment.", "Such was a measure of his success, reputation, and existing commitments that Smeaton found it necessary to charge for his consultations at the follow levels:", "to enter upon no business till he has received such a gratuity for performing it \u2026 his lowest fee for a consultation at home, is one guinea; but if sent for, two guineas: and if employed the whole morning or day in London, five guineas.", "Encyclopaedia Britannica: John Smeaton", "Engineer Biography: John Smeaton", "Grace\u2019s Guide: John Smeaton", "Smiles, Samuel.

Isabelle Alaya, Founder and Director of the Museum, explains the science behind the process and how you can become a chocolate chemist.", "Did you know that in order to make chocolate glossy, smooth and silky in texture it has to be tempered? Chocolatiers have to manipulate the sugar and fat crystals within the cocoa butter by meticulously heating, cooling and agitating its molecular properties so the mixture crystallises into its most stable form. While the process may seem complex, everyone can become a chocolate chemist and temper their own chocolate at home. Here\u2019s what you\u2019ll need:", "First, like all good chemists, be aware of your experiment surroundings and your equipment before you begin the process. Chocolate should be tempered in a cool, dry environment, as moisture and humidity can cause the sugar crystals to evaporate, leaving your chocolate with streaks and a gritty, matte texture. Keeping this in mind, make sure all your equipment is dry and shut your windows on a humid day.", "Take your saucepan and fill it with two inches of water to create a bain-marie. The trick is to ensure that when you place your large melting bowl over the pan the base does not touch the water, otherwise the chocolate at the bottom of the bowl will heat over boiling point and split, ruining its molecular structure.", "Bring your water to a gentle simmer over a medium to low heat, fill your bowl with chocolate, place it over the saucepan, and leave it to melt for at least ten minutes. Many chocolatiers insist on leaving their chocolate to melt for at least one to two hours to completely separate the existing sugar and fat crystals, but letting your chocolate melt for at least ten minutes will still enable you to melt the appropriate crystals and get the shine and smooth texture you\u2019re looking for in tempered chocolate.", "As your chocolate melts, the chemical changes in the cocoa butter begin to take place. Cocoa butter makes up 55% of what is extracted from the cocoa bean and its intricate molecular structure is what gives chocolate its enticing aroma and silky texture. Cocoa butter is believed to be made up of at least six different types of sugar and fat crystals each with their own melting temperatures, but only one, Form V (or the \u1e9e crystal form), is exactly right as it melts at body temperature and has a firm, stable and shiny texture that snaps when set.", "Once fully melted, lift your bowl of melted chocolate off the heat. The crystals within the cocoa butter will now be fully separated. Now chocolatiers manipulate the crystallisation of the cocoa butter by controlling its cooling through a process called tempering.", "The first step of tempering involves agitating the mixture to ensure that it quickly cools to a temperature between 27-28\u00b0C, causing part of the mixture to crystallise in a V formation. After this step, chocolatiers reheat the mixture to 31\u00b0C for milk (30\u00b0C for white, 32\u00b0C for dark chocolate). Through this process an inner grid of stable crystals are formed, leaving the chocolate perfectly shiny and with a crisp snap when broken. To speed up this method, chocolatiers often work on marble which has incredible natural cooling properties.", "There is a simpler way to temper your chocolate at home using a process called the \u2018seeding\u2019 method. To temper chocolate by seeding you must agitate and cool the mixture by adding solid chocolate and mixing forcibly. It takes roughly an extra third of the amount of chocolate you melted to temper your chocolate perfectly. Check the chocolate\u2019s temperature frequently as you add your additional chocolate in small pieces and mix them quickly into the bowl. Allow them to melt entirely before adding more. When you have reached the working temperature (31\u00b0C for milk, 30\u00b0C for white, 32\u00b0C for dark chocolate), you can start filing your desired mould, dipping, coating or drizzling.", "", "To check your chocolate is tempered and ready to work with, you can dip a metal teaspoon into the bowl and wait to see how it dries. If the cocoa butter has crystallised into the desired V formation, the chocolate will set with an entirely glossy shine. Alternatively, if you rub the surface of the chocolate it should have a smooth texture that melts at body temperature.", "\u2018Blooming\u2019, a common problem in chocolate making, may occur during this tempering process. This is recognisable by any discoloured grey casting, streaks and spots in the chocolate and is by the fat crystals forming into an unstable crystal formation during the tempering process.", "Blooming may also cause your chocolate to be noticeably rough in texture, often caused by high humidity or exposure to moisture. The surface sugar crystals will absorb the moisture and dissolve, after the moisture has evaporated the sugar will recrystallize into a different and larger crystal formation which is grainier in texture. But don\u2019t worry, if this happens you can always remelt the chocolate and start the process all over again!", "Happy chocolate making!", "Visit Robots until 3 September 2017 with late night openings every Friday until 22.00.", "If you would like to keep up to date with what\u2019s happening at the Museum you can sign up to our email newsletter ."]},

While this information flowed from the east, the Germans Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus and Johann Friedrich B\u00f6ttger had independently discovered the secret of hard-paste porcelain manufacture in 1710, establishing the Meissen Porcelain Manufactory near Dresden.", "English manufacturers were behind. The first soft-paste in England was only demonstrated\u00a0in 1742\u00a0by the chemist Thomas Briand to the Royal Society. In contrast to the hard-paste porcelain\u00a0fired at high temperatures which was\u00a0being manufactured in Germany and imported from China, Briand\u2019s soft-paste porcelain did not easily retain its shape in its wet state, and slumped in the kiln under high temperatures. This also meant the glaze could be easily scratched. Nevertheless there was a rush of porcelain manufacturing following Briand\u2019s method; the Chelsea Porcelain Factory and the Bow Porcelain Factory in London, where the first factories were founded, started traditions in this period that still define their signature designs today, such as Wedgewood and Spode .", "One of these early factories was different. Plymouth Porcelain, established in 1769 used kaolin and \u2018china stone\u2019 to make hard-paste porcelain similar to Chinese porcelain imports of the early 18th century. This factory was established by the chemist and Quaker minister William Cookworthy.", "Cookworthy began an apprenticeship with the Quaker apothecaries Timothy and Sylvanus Bevan in Plough Court, London. Cookworthy, coming from a poor part of rural Devon, walked to London, saving the coach fare, to start work at age 15. Quickly recognising his outstanding intelligence and practical skill, the Bevan brothers took Cookworthy into their partnership at the end of his apprenticeship in 1726 and formed \u2018Bevans and Cookworthy\u2019, a wholesale chemist and druggist in Plymouth, servicing the west-country doctors and the navy at the port.", "After the death of his wife Sarah a decade later, Cookworthy retreated entirely from public life leaving his brother to manage his business. He devoted his energies to walking, religious work and began experimental work with clay.", "Cookworthy quickly realised that two key ingredients of Chinese porcelain \u2013 kaolin for the body and petuntse for the glaze \u2013 were to be found in the china clay and moorstone (called locally: growan) in the Cornish moors.", "By 1758 he was successfully firing hard-paste porcelain, but the discovery of abundant deposits of high-quality china clay and moorstone on the estate of Thomas Pitt , later Lord Camelford, allowed Cookworthy to think of factory scale production. Pitt financed Cookworthy\u2019s continuing experimental work and in 1768 helped him obtain a patent, to protect his method in a competitive market.", "In the same year, Cookworthy opened a porcelain factory in Plymouth. This quickly cemented Cookworthy\u2019s position as a significant member of intellectual society, with John Smeaton choosing to lodge with him during the building of the Eddystone Lighthouse, and Captain James Cook , Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander all dining with him before sailing from Plymouth in 1768.", "The business moved to 15 Caste Green, Bristol, where porcelain was manufactured under Cookworthy\u2019s supervision until his retirement in 1773. His partner Richard Champion bought Cookworthy\u2019s half of the business and the rights to his patent, but only continued production until 1778. Champion sold the method and the factory to a syndicate of Staffordshire Potters who used Cornish clay to make bone-china. The true porcelain manufacturing method, invented and pioneered by Cookworthy, virtually ceased in Britain after the closure of the Bristol factory.", "Bristol porcelain is displayed by many art and design collections in the UK, appreciated for its elegance, but with this teacup held by the Science Museum we can remember the link between the art and science of innovation in the Georgian period; materials and design affecting each other, with hard-paste porcelain allowing Cookworthy to produce items rivalling those from Jingdezhen, something his British counterparts could only try to imitate 250 years ago."]},

But why get excited about a photochemical print of a half-century old film? Surely the advances in digital projection have far surpassed anything that Kubrick could have achieved in the 1960s.", "Well, it is true that many old films have benefited from digital restoration, cleaning off the dirt and scratches that have built up over the years and bringing back some of the vivid clarity of their original colours, but the fact remains that even the sharpest 4K digital projection only captures about 25% of the resolution of the original 70mm print and, regardless of what the sales people in the TV show room may tell you, there are some colours that just don\u2019t translate from film to digital. 2001: A Space Odyssey , Unrestored has the scratches and glitches of a hand-crafted artefact, but it has so much more that all digital \u201capproximations\u201d of the film have lost over the years.", "2001: A Space Odyssey is where the modern science fiction aesthetic\u00a0\u2013 so successfully adopted by Star Wars a decade later \u2013 really begins. Kubrick rejected cinema\u2019s previous fantasy-based efforts to represent space travel, turning instead to NASA and the rapidly developing world of high-tech industry to create a compelling future that is as much concerned about the small details, such as the Pan Am logo on the tail of the shuttle, as it is about the grand scale of the solar system and the machines that transport our heroes across it.", "Rather like the Apollo Moon missions themselves, 2001 seemingly fell out of the future, fully formed, into the late 1960s. Cinema audiences had never seen anything like it before and not all the initial reactions were good with many people famously walking out of the film\u2019s premiere during the interval.", "But great art \u2013 and 2001 is great art, not just another movie \u2013 often gets a bumpy ride at the beginning and can sometimes take many years to be accepted for what it actually is. And art, or rather the art world, is where Kubrick found his inspiration for one of the other key components of the film; the representation of the alien and the infinite, embodied in the inscrutable black monolith with its obvious debt to 20th century art such as Kazimir Malevich\u2019s \u201cBlack Square\u201d painting of 1915.", "Kubrick relentlessly pushed at the limits of every aspect of his film which in turn inspired his collaborators to astonishing heights \u2013 for my money, the dazzlingly abstract \u201cStargate\u201d sequence, created by legendary effects artist Douglas Trumbull , is the greatest ever piece of visual effects filmmaking which I don\u2019t think will be surpassed (and\u00a0believe me, I have tried!)", "A good 70mm photochemical presentation of 2001 on a really big screen is a revelation and, fortunately for us, the IMAX Theatre at the Science Museum in London has one of the biggest screens anywhere.

Traditionally, the role of Master had been a ceremonial one, but Newton was too practical to sit back and not make a contribution. He enjoyed solving problems and there were various matters that caught his attention.", "One problem that the Mint faced was that of counterfeit coins. The narrative of Newton pursuing counterfeiters through the courts has been widely shared , but there was another aspect to the story which has not received the same amount of attention.", "Newton brought his methodical, thorough and pragmatic approach to the question of how to prevent, or at least lower, counterfeiting. He concluded that he could reduce the number of counterfeit coins in circulation if the coinage produced by the Mint was made more difficult to forge.", "As a result, he encouraged the Mint\u2019s engravers who were responsible for engraving coin designs on to the master punches (the tools used to make the coins) to take on private work outside of their contracted working hours. Newton recognised that this would enable them to improve their skills, making their engraved designs of a much higher quality and thus more difficult to replicate by the counterfeiters. This move was certainly successful and while fake coins were not entirely eliminated, the number of them passing through the market undetected was dramatically reduced.", "A different kind of problem emerged in 1710 when Newton became involved in a dispute with the Goldsmiths\u2019 Company over the quality of the Mint\u2019s coinage. The precious metal content of the coins produced by the Royal Mint has been verified in a procedure known as the Trial of the Pyx since 1282, presided over by the Goldsmith\u2019s Company. The trial consists of checking the weight, diameter, and composition of coins by a jury who are independent of the Mint. Jurors also compare the coins against official trial plates made of gold and silver.", "In 1710 the judgement of the Trial was that Newton\u2019s gold coins were below the required standard \u2013 it was argued that they did not contain enough gold. Newton prided himself on accuracy and reacted angrily to this judgement. The coins had been compared with a new gold trial plate introduced in 1707 and Newton managed to prove that it was in fact the plate that contained too much gold, so in fact his coins were not below the required standard. As a result, the earlier trial plate of 1688 was returned to use at the Trial of the Pyx.", "Newton\u2019s work over 30 years at the Mint raised its profile and gained it the reputation as the most trustworthy Mint with the most accurately struck coins in the world. Rather than bringing in new inventions or new processes, Newton demonstrated that adopting a scientific approach to improving existing practices was the best way to bring about improvements and solve problems.", "It was during this period of his life in London that Newton became President of the Royal Society . Having had correspondence with the Society on and off during his Cambridge years, Newton had very little contact with it during the first seven years of his life in London. His disagreements with Robert Hooke were probably one reason for the lack of contact, but within eight months of Hooke\u2019s death, the Fellows elected Newton as their President in November 1703.", "Newton brought the same methodical, attentive approach to the Royal Society that he had to the Mint. Unlike his two predecessors, who between them attended just three meetings in eight years, Newton attended more than three of the quarterly meetings.", "One of his primary concerns was the content of the meetings and at his first, he brought along the scientific instrument maker, Francis Hauksbee the Elder to demonstrate experiments with his air pump. Hauksbee continued to perform demonstrations at meetings and published many articles on them in the Philosophical Transactions until his death in 1713. Newton also improved the Society\u2019s finances during his presidency, taking it from the verge of bankruptcy to being in a position to purchase its own building in 1710.", "Newton held both his posts as Master of the Mint and President of the Royal Society until his death in 1727. His London years were far removed from his life as an isolated don at Trinity College Cambridge but the work he did at the Mint and at the Royal Society should be seen as an important part of his wider contribution to science.", "Discover more about how London grew from a lively capital city to a global hub for trade, commerce, and scientific enquiry in Science City 1550\u20131800: The Linbury Gallery ."]},

Hooke even built an observatory on the roof above.", "Gresham College very narrowly escaped the flames of the Great Fire of London in 1666; many other buildings were not so lucky. Perhaps the most famous casualty was the medieval St Paul\u2019s Cathedral less than a mile away, rebuilt to the designs of its chief architect, Christopher Wren .", "This may be Wren\u2019s best-known architectural legacy, but he was very much a polymath, having already served as Astronomy Professor at Gresham College and going on to be elected President of the Royal Society in 1680.", "Wren and Hooke were both instrumental in surveying and rebuilding London, and they closely collaborated on the design of the nearby Monument to the Great Fire. Much more than a memorial, amazingly the Monument was also a scientific instrument. It functioned as a gigantic telescope, with a hatch at the top opening to reveal the heavens which could then be observed all the way from down in the basement.", "Air pressure experiments were also conducted inside the Monument\u2019s stairwell using barometers made by Daniel Quare , although vibrations from horse-drawn carriages on the surrounding streets made its effectiveness as a site for scientific activity short-lived.", "Almost at the Monument\u2019s doorstep is London Bridge, whose predecessor, \u201cOld\u201d London Bridge, was for centuries the capital\u2019s only river crossing. It was joined, further to the west, by a bridge at Westminster built between 1738 and 1750. The construction of \u201cOld\u201d Westminster Bridge (for it, too, has since been replaced) was a major engineering spectacle at the time.", "A machine powered by horses drove its timber piles, or foundations, 14 feet into the Thames riverbed every hour. This sped up the construction process considerably and the machine\u2019s designer, watchmaker James Vaulou\u00e9 , was awarded the Royal Society\u2019s prestigious Copley Medal.", "Vaulou\u00e9\u2019s pile-driving machine was celebrated as a technological innovation. The artist Samuel Scott depicted its use at Westminster in several paintings, and print-sellers sold souvenir images of it. Lecturers even used models of the machine to demonstrate the practical applications of mechanical principles for middle- and upper-class audiences interested in natural philosophy, or science.", "The arrival of Westminster Bridge led to new developments and improved roads, particularly south of the Thames, and would no doubt have made for a pleasant stroll towards St George\u2019s Fields near Southwark. This was the site of a hot air balloon ascent in 1785, just as aeronautical technology was really beginning to take off (pun intended).", "On Wednesday 29 June, the actress Letitia Ann Sage became England\u2019s first female aeronaut when she went up in a balloon with a Mr George Biggin . Sage later recounted how \u2018We arose in a slow and majestic manner, forming a most beautiful object, amidst the acclamations of thousands\u2019.", "This spectacular moment was captured in a painting by Julius Caesar Ibbetson .

The Tower has been an iconic feature of the capital\u2019s skyline since the eleventh century, but its stories of science are less familiar.", "Until the early 1800s it was home to the Royal Mint where the nation\u2019s coinage was produced. Isaac Newton , the great scientific thinker whom we most often associate with the theory of gravity, and himself President of the Royal Society after Wren, was actually Warden and then Master of the Mint between 1696 and 1727. During this time he used scientific techniques to assess the gold and silver content of new coins with unprecedented accuracy.", "The Board of Ordnance was also based at the Tower. Its draughtsmen drew up the maps for the first Ordnance Survey , carried out between 1791 and 1858. This phenomenal undertaking, which produced the most accurate map of the entire country known at the time, began on Hounslow Heath , then on the very western outskirts of London.

Using a classical computer to break a 2048-bit key would, based on his assumptions, take roughly the entire UK electricity generating capacity 150,000 years, said Levy.", "However, quantum computers with around 100,000 qubits (we can only manage around 50 at present) could do this job in seconds. Ian Levy said that this is \u2018kind of cool but really scary\u2019 but added that mathematics already provides new ways of doing cryptography that cannot be cracked so easily by a quantum machine.", "Quantum computers can run the same programs that we can use on classical computers.", "They must use different kinds of algorithms and, to develop them, computer scientists need more quantum computing hardware \u2018to try ideas out\u2019, said Viv Kendon.", "Quantum Communication will be important.", "Quantum theory, which is deeply counter-intuitive, states that particles can be in two places at once, another example of superposition. Moreover, two particles can be related, or \u2018entangled,\u2019 so that their properties are linked, regardless of their relative distance, which some have used for secure communications since they reveal if someone is tampering.\u00a0 But these only provide links between given points, which is highly restrictive, said Levy.", "Quantum computers will be better at modelling the real world.", "Yes, when it comes to quantum systems, for instance when it comes to designing materials bottom-up, from scratch, a long-held dream described by Peter Love: \u2018We really believe quantum computers can solve that problem.\u2019", "However, he added that although classical computing has failed to crack this problem for the past 60 years, scientists lack the proof that they will never be solved this way.", "They will be used to help create a \u2018digital doppelganger\u2019 of patients, a so-called virtual human , to test treatments and drugs , said Prof Coveney. However, these simulations of the body will have to work at a range of scales, from the level of atoms (amenable to quantum computing) to the level of organs, where conventional computers can be used.", "Quantum machines could become conscious.", "Prof Al-Khalili warned the audience before opening the discussion that anyone who suggests that quantum computers, which are somewhat mysterious, can somehow solve the consciousness, itself a notoriously hard-to-define concept, \u2018will be taken out and shot.\u2019", "Join more discussions like this at our monthly Lates event ."]},

Pioneering efforts in the understanding of hydrogen bonding in metals, establishing structures for ice, Megaw also published the definitive text on ferroelectrics .", "In 1946, Megaw wrote to Marcus Brumwell, director of the Design Research Unit , and suggested that the wallpaper and fabric designers at the Unit might be inspired by the patterns that \u2018crop-up\u2019 in her work.

He sits confidently at the centre of the picture, right hand resting on a table and holding a watch made to his design by watchmaker John Jeffries.", "On the table lies a page of drawings of clock parts, and at each shoulder stand two impressive machines: on the left his third marine timekeeper (now known as H3) in its travelling case, on the right his compound pendulum, designed to compensate for metal expansion and contraction in different temperatures at sea.", "The portrait assembles Harrison\u2019s arsenal of material proofs against the Board of Longitude. The Board was arguably the first government science funding body, established in 1714 to find a means of measuring longitude accurately at sea, and adjudicator of large reward money for the solutions. By 1767, when this portrait was painted, Harrison had spent over 30 years in discussion with the Board, receiving sequential funding to develop a series of timekeepers.", "In the 1760s, their relationship had become increasingly strained around the question of whether and how Harrison had fulfilled the terms necessary to receive the \u2018great reward\u2019. In 1767 the Board published the Principles of Mr Harrison\u2019s Timekeeper , essentially to see if his designs could be replicated by other clock and watchmakers. A similar page of designs lies under Harrison\u2019s hand on the table in his portrait.", "King\u2019s confident portrait belies a sitter both bullish and plaintive in pursuit of his dreams.

Salicylic acid, extracted from willow trees, was used to treat fever, pain, and inflammation in ancient Mesopotamia.", "In ancient Greece, Hippocrates (460\u2013370 BCE) recommended chewing on willow-tree bark to patients suffering from fever and pain, as well as the use of a tea brewed from willow bark to lessen the pain of childbirth.", "The chemical investigation of the healing properties of the substance found in willow bark began when Napoleon blocked continental imports, which affected supplies of Peruvian cinchona-tree bark (another natural source of salicylic acid).", "In 1828 a yellow substance was isolated from willow tree tannins by Johann B\u00fcchner, a professor at the University of Munich; he named the substance salicin, the Latin word for willow. A year later, a pure crystalline form of salicin was isolated in 1829 by Henri Leroux, a French pharmacist, who prescribed it to treat rheumatism.", "The beginning of aspirin as we know it today dates from the late 1880s.", "In 1878, a chemical laboratory was built by Friedrich Bayer and Company, a dye-manufacturing firm in Germany that had begun to shift from the dye industry to pharmaceutical production.

Along with the ancient knowledge of the healing benefits of salicylic acid, the negative effects of prolonged use of the drug for digestion were also well known.", "Hoffmann was particularly motivated; his father had rheumatism and could no longer take salicylic acid without suffering from vomiting and painful cramps. Hoffmann discovered a way to alter salicylic acid chemically, modifying the hydroxyl group on the benzene ring. The key to Hoffman\u2019s discovery, although not realised till the 1970s, was that this slightly altered salicylic acid could be absorbed by the body without gastrointestinal discomfort.", "Once swallowed, the new molecule is converted back to salicylic acid in the blood and is able to relieve pain after being ingested. Hoffman\u2019s synthetic aspirin wasn\u2019t the discovery of a new treatment, but is remembered by historians as the invention of a drug-delivery system for a natural product that has been in medical use for millennia.", "The first tablet form of aspirin appeared in 1900, alongside power forms, creating an ease of use that quickly expanded the drug\u2019s prominence for both medical professionals and patients. In 1915 aspirin became available without a prescription, making it the first synthetic, over-the-counter, mass-market medicine and a household name around the world.", "Marketing campaigns for pharmaceutical products like aspirin were prominent throughout the 1900s as the Bayer fought back against other companies who produced aspirin after Hoffman\u2019s innovation at the turn of the century.", "In the Science Museum\u2019s Making the Modern World Gallery you can see aspirin tablets manufactured in London, by the Warwick Brothers after the Second World War.", ""]},

Later I joined them for an event at the Royal Institution , where Cosmonauts curator Doug Millard and conservator Kate Perks also brought along Helen\u2019s radio helmet.", "The world\u2019s first spacesuits were developed by the NPP (Research & Development Production Enterprise) Zvezda (\u2018Star\u2019), which was built in 1952 in the Moscow province of Tomilino and was led for many decades by academician Guy Severin, an expert in developing and creating life-support systems for pilots and cosmonauts. To this very day, every cosmonaut from Yuri Gagarin onwards has passed through this venerable space institution. \u201cThe road to the cosmos passes via Zvezda,\u201d explains Severin\u2019s successor, Sergei Pozdnyakov, chief executive and designer.", "The world\u2019s first spacesuit, SK-1 \u2013 orange, with a white helmet inscribed in red \u2018CCCP\u2019 \u2013 was worn in the first flight by Gagarin to the sixth by Valentina Tereshkova . Development of the SK-1 by Zvezda began in 1959 but Helen Sharman would wear a later design, the Sokol, which was developed more than a decade later in response to a tragedy.", "Pressure suits had been used on the early Vostok space missions, but when the Soyuz spacecraft was being developed in the mid-1960s the controversial decision was taken not to use them on the new spacecraft. That changed after the death in 1971 of the crew of Soyuz-11 , Georgi Dobrovolsky, Vladislav Volkov and Viktor Patsaev, who all perished while returning from the Salyut-1 space station when their descent module lost pressure.", "Human space flights were temporarily halted and Zvezda designed the new Sokol-K spacesuit within a year. The spacesuit design evolved from the pressure suits worn by the first jet pilots to help them to cope with low pressure and lack of oxygen at high altitudes by supplying their air to them in a person-shaped\u201a pressurized bag.", "Zvezda replaced the rigid helmet of these jet pilot suits with a soft, non-removable helmet, including a hinged glass visor which could be lifted. To become a space suit they also had to redesign its basic shape. Pozdnyakov explained that, while an aircraft pilot adopts the same position as a car driver, a cosmonaut sits more like \u201can embryo in the womb\u201d.", "The resulting Sokol-K first came into use in 1973. Since its introduction, Zvezda has tweaked the design, trying various different gusset-openings, lacings, separation of the two halves at chest or waist level, and water-cooled emergency suits. In an emergency, it turns out that it is most important to have a spacesuit that can be put on quickly and, by the close of the 1970s, the organisation had essentially settled on today\u2019s model, the Sokol KV-2. \u201cIn space travel, it is absolutely essential that all the technology and the systems should be 100% reliable, so that most of our time is spent not so much on developing new things, but on optimizing, perfecting and testing the old,\u201d said Pozdnyakov.", "The 22 lb suit consists of an inner layer of rubberised material and outer layer of white nylon. The suit includes the cosmonaut\u2019s feet and its gloves attach by means of blue anodised aluminium wrist couplings. There is a pressure gauge on the left wrist and a mirror on the right to help the cosmonaut see things that would otherwise be outside his or her field of view.", "The fundamental design of any spacesuit ultimately depends on its use. For the Buran (\u2018Snowstorm\u2019) spaceship, cosmonauts would take a more active role, demanding a new kind of spacesuit. The Soviet manned lunar programme required the development of the Krechet (\u2018Gyrfalcon\u2019) space suit, which had a rigid body with soft sleeves and soft trouser legs. \u00a0This led to the Orlan (\u2018Sea-Eagle\u2019) series of semi-rigid spacesuits, used for spacewalks.", "The Sokol holds a special place in space culture, remarks Pozdnyakov. Hundreds of these suits have been made over the years. The Sokol \u201chas become a symbol of man\u2019s flight into the cosmos,\u201d he explained in the book to accompany the exhibition . \u201cAs the developers, we find it very nice to hear Sandra Bullock, the star of the Hollywood film Gravity, saying that the Russian space suit is a work of art.\u201d", "Update: Helen Sharman\u2019s spacesuit is now on display in the Science Museum\u2019s Exploring Space gallery."]},

The trip, which lasted 15 minutes from start to finish, made Tsygan and Dezik the first animals to experience space flight and to emerge from the craft unharmed.", "The completely new field of space biology was asking many questions about whether humans and other animals could survive an extended trip into outer space. The scientists involved needed to test the boundaries of endurance on actual living creatures. Was it possible to survive the extreme accelerations and decelerations of launching and landing? How could basic life-support needs \u2013 such as air, water and food \u2013 be supplied away from the home planet? And finally, would the experience of weightlessness inside a small capsule be harmful? Scientists needed to test life-support equipment, develop a training regimen for crews and perform tests in space. All of this had to be completed before human crews could embark on space exploration.", "By the time of the first Soviet space dog crew , American scientists had attempted a number of launches using monkeys in V2 and Aerobee rockets, and all of them ended in the death of the animals. But the information collected during the flights demonstrated that the animals could cope with the intense G-forces and stresses of the rocket launches.", "Chief Designer Sergei Korolev decided that the Soviet space programme would, on the other hand, work with dogs. The choice of dogs, \u2018man\u2019s best friend\u2019, over monkeys, among our closest genetic relatives, was based on rational reasoning springing from emotional attachment. The Russian scientists believed they could build stronger bonds with the animals and so ensure their obedience. They also believed that the dogs eking out an existence on the harsh streets of Moscow would possess a survivalist temperament.", "There were strict criteria for scouting the first-star squad of dogs. They had to be female because the specialised clothing and toilet technology was easier to tailor to them. And they needed to be small in size: 6 to 7 kg each to accommodate the strict weight limit for the rocket. These dogs also needed to have light-coloured fur, in order to show up clearly in front of the onboard camera. The scientists had even attempted to bleach the fur of one of their favourite darker dogs without success.", "In the six years of stratospheric dog flights only a few launches ended in tragedy. But through these sacrifices, enough information was gathered on whether living beings were likely to survive a trip into space. After the launch of an untrained puppy called ZIB (a quick replacement for a runaway dog), Chief Designer Korolev was ecstatic. At the landing site, when greeted by the happy puppy, he announced to his colleagues:", "\u2018Space travellers will soon be flying in our spaceships with state visas \u2013 on a holiday!\u2019", "These early tests , conducted in secrecy, culminated in the final question: could a living creature survive a prolonged stay in zero gravity?", "The most successful canine mission was perhaps the one performed by Belka and Strelka in 1960, who completed 18 orbits and returned to Earth in perfect health. They were greeted by an international press corps at a news conference in Moscow and their friendly faces were broadcast around the world. Belka went on to have a litter of puppies, one of which was given to the American first lady Jacqueline Kennedy by Russian premier Nikita Khrushchev.", "At the time of this gift, Korolev already knew the name of the cosmonaut who would be the first to fly into space. By the time of Gagarin\u2019s flight , 48 dogs had been to space and 20 had perished."]},

He wanted to test out the limitations of his revolutionary invention: the bubble chamber .", "Previously, Glaser had only tried exotic chemical liquids in his device. But now his sense of experimental adventure had been galvanised by a recent victory over the great and famously infallible physicist Enrico Fermi .", "Fermi, who had invited Glaser to Chicago to find out more about his invention, had already seemingly proved that a bubble chamber could not work. But when Glaser found a mistake in Fermi\u2019s authoritative textbook, he dedicated himself to redoing the calculations.", "Glaser\u00a0found that, if he was correct, that the bubble chamber should work with water.\u00a0To make absolutely certain he \u201cwasn\u2019t being stupid\u201d, Glaser conducted this curious nocturnal experiment at his Michigan laboratory. He also discovered that the bubble chamber worked just as well when using lager as it had with other chemicals.", "There was one practical issue however, the beer caused the whole physics department to smell like a brewery.\u00a0\u201cAnd this was a problem for two reasons,\u201d Glaser recalled. \u201cOne is that it was illegal to have any alcoholic beverage within 500 yards of the university. The other problem was that the chairman was a very devout teetotaler, and he was furious. He almost fired me on the spot\u201d.", "On 1 st August 1953, 60 years ago this Thursday, Glaser published his famous paper on the bubble chamber \u2013 strangely failing to mention the beer experiment.", "Glaser\u2019s device provided a very effective way to detect and visualise particles. It consisted of a tank of pressurised liquid, which was then superheated by reducing the pressure. Charged particles passing through the tank stripped electrons\u00a0from atoms in the liquid and caused the liquid to boil. Bubbles created from the boiling liquid revealed the particle\u2019s path through the liquid.", "One of Glaser\u2019s motivations for his invention was to avoid having to work with large groups of scientists at big particle accelerators. Instead, he hoped his device would enable him to study cosmic rays using cloud chambers in the traditional fashion;\u00a0up a mountain, ski in the day, \u201cand work in sort of splendid, beautiful surroundings. A very pleasant way of life \u2013 intellectual, aesthetic, and athletic\u201d", "Ironically, as the bubble chamber only worked with controlled sources of particles, it was inherently suited to accelerator research, not cosmic rays. Soon the large accelerator facilities built their own, massive bubble chambers.", "Between 1965-1970 CERN built Gargamelle \u2013 a bubble chamber of such proportions that it was named after a giantess from the novels of Francois Rabelais (not the Smurfs\u2019 villain). Gargamelle proved a huge success, enabling the discovery of neutral currents \u2013 a crucial step in understanding how some of the basic forces of nature were once unified.", "This November you\u2019ll have the chance to see up close the original design drawings for Gargamelle, and much more in the Collider exhibition."]},

Among the incredible artworks were a giant hand showing the five countries contributing the most towards carbon emissions and a homeless polar pear begging on the streets. The project was turned into a photographic exhibition which toured at each of the partner museums.", "In year two, students from 50 schools across the country became science journalists, investigating and reporting on climate change stories affecting their communities. The result was a fascinating range of stories covering everything from community recycling initiatives to the use of sheep poo as a future energy source. The students\u2019 stories were published in ATMOS \u2013 a special magazine for the project.", "In the third and final year of the programme, students from 60 schools were set the challenge of organising and running a mass-participation event in their school or community to raise awareness of climate change.", "Students were asked to submit proposals and bid for funding from the Science Museum.

We owe particular thanks to the boundlessly energetic Michael Hoch who looked after us for the day and made it all possible.", "Meanwhile, 13km around the ring, in a less spectacular CERN office, our radio producer and I carried out audio interviews of LHC physicists and engineers. Each of them sharing what makes them tick as scientists and inventors. One even surprised us by dismissing the discovery of the Higgs boson as \u201cboring\u201d; what drives him as a scientist is seeking answers to new questions.

They were most often worn by gondoliers who needed protection while working in the sunny canals of Venice.", "Also in the 18th century, therapeutic eye-preservers became popular in Britain for those who suffered from pre-existing conditions that made them sensitive to light. Though not technically considered sunglasses, it was thought that their blue or green lenses would correct vision impairments and alleviate discomfort caused by glare.", "Some of the first examples of inexpensive mass-produced sunglasses were made by Foster Grant and sold to beach-goers in Atlantic City, United States in 1929. With the advent of injection moulding techniques, Foster Grant was able to manufacture sunglasses made from celluloid. Sales were bolstered by advertisements featuring Hollywood celebrities, making sunglasses a fashion staple.", "During World War II, military organisations began designing spectacles for pilots who needed glasses that would enhance their vision and reduce glare at high altitude. The US Army Air Corps enlisted the help of eyeglasses maker Bausch & Lomb, who developed the iconic Ray-Ban Aviator in 1939. The RAF also designed anti-glare glasses for their pilots, such as these pictured.", "Polaroid lenses were invented in the 1930s in Massachusetts, United States. Polaroid applied a filter to lenses that blocked glare from reflected light, greatly increasing visibility. This made activities such as driving, skiing and cycling much safer and more comfortable. Though polaroid lenses do improve vision, they do not always block ultraviolet light.", "Today, it is understood that exposure to ultraviolet light can lead to cataracts and vision loss later in life.

Consider Vesalius\u2019s sixteenth-century anatomical masterpiece De humani corporis fabrica .", "This beautifully illustrated text proposed new ideas about the construction of the human body. In doing so, it complicated anatomical models by the second-century Greek physician Galen, which had been accepted \u2013 and revered \u2013 for centuries.", "The eighteenth-century part of the collection also includes several visual show-stoppers. For example, these spectacular obstetrical illustrations were published in William Smellie\u2019s A sett of anatomical tables, with explanations, and an abridgement, of the practice of midwifery . This large folio volume was meant to accompany Smellie\u2019s other writings on midwifery.", "Instrumental in the development of male midwifery, Smellie (1697\u20131763) experimented with the use of forceps in childbirth, eventually designing his own leather-covered version of the instrument (see the Museum\u2019s collection of Smellie forceps on the collections page ).", "In the last decade, however, questions have been raised about where Smellie acquired the large number of female bodies depicted in A sett of anatomical tables : some have suggested that the corpses of pregnant women may have been acquired illegitimately or violently, whilst others have argued that the figures may not all have been copied from corpses, but from anatomical models. Another theory is that the artists responsible for the images \u2013 who also illustrated other obstetrical texts \u2013 may have used their previous artistic experience to produce some drawings.", "When including books like this in a collection or exhibition, it is important to recognise the multitude of human stories they tell: the stories of those involved in their production, dissemination and reception deserve acknowledgement.", "A handwritten memorandum describing which books the Museum Library wished to add to its collection recognised this human element. Probably dating from the 1990s, this informal note lists several kinds of scientific book that the Library was \u2013 or had been \u2013 interested in collecting. The first category, called \u2018landmarks\u2019, describes books that had a momentous impact on the development of science. But the note says that the Library was no longer so concerned with acquiring these, because it already possessed a large number.", "Instead, it was turning its attention to books that were \u2018less well-known [\u2026] but significant in their field\u2019 and books of \u2018\u201cprofessional\u201d quality not enormously innovative or original\u2019.

Some were printed and revised a surprisingly large number of times, suggesting popularity in their own era. For example, a seemingly unremarkable pamphlet on scrofula written by John Morley, a gentleman from Essex, is not visually stunning; it contains only one illustrated plate. But it was revised or reprinted at least 42 times between 1760 and 1824.", "Others display evidence of being highlights in individual lives. For instance, a copy of John Hill\u2019s eighteenth-century British Herbal is prefaced with a note revealing that, in 1898, a father gave the herbal as a Christmas present to his daughter Molly.", "Similarly, an eighteenth-century botanical text by William Woodville is signed by the nineteenth-century missionary John Barton in the same year that he graduated from Cambridge with honours in mathematics and natural sciences.", "So, what we can learn by looking closer at such collections is that all of these books \u2013 whatever their shape or size \u2013 can have interesting human stories to tell.", "Find out more about Hannah\u2019s pop-up display here ."]},

By that time, telegraph time was an established technology, with commercial firms such as the Standard Time Company competing with the Post Office telegraph time service for custom.\u00a0But the electric telegraph, whilst more modern, was not as accurate as the old pocket watch, nor as reliable.", "In my research I found countless written complaints about the Post Office time service. It seems they had a lot of trouble keeping their lines in order, whereas Maria Belville turned up every week, as regular as clockwork.

She once said that she found \u2018Tim\u2019 a vulgar name. She died in 1943, three years after retiring. Her trusty pocket watch was by her bedside.

More than a decade after being declared lost, the discovery of Beagle 2 was announced on 16th January 2015.", "Among those who gathered with the Beagle 2 mission members in the museum yesterday was his widow, Judith Pillinger of the Open University, who thought it was a shame that the legacy of the mission had not been captured because it had never generated any scientific data, which the Science Museum now hopes to remedy.", "A team led by Prof Mark Sims of the University of Leicester and Jim Clemmet, former Beagle 2 Chief Engineer, with other colleagues in the University of Leicester, De Montfort University, UCL, last year published a detailed analysis of the fate of Beagle 2 in the Journal of the British Interplanetary Society (JBIS), along with the Royal Society Open Science journal .", "\u2018It was an engineering success and although it did not return scientific data from Mars the instrumentation is being developed for a wide range of uses,\u2019 the team said.", "The JBIS paper listed evidence that the pixelated HiRISE images were indeed Beagle 2, working out from the size, reflectivities, colour, location and dispersion on the surface and then using virtual modelling to simulate and confirm the HiRISE images.", "Based upon these analyses, an impressive list of mission successes has been notched up because it is clear that, as planned, Beagle 2 did survive the harrowing entry, descent and landing sequence and successfully deployed its parachute and gasbags to \u201cbounce down\u201d on the Martian surface.", "An ESA enquiry had placed emphasis on collision between the back cover and the main parachute, failure of the ultra-lightweight main parachute or failure of airbags and potential entanglement of the parachute and airbag during bounces.", "We now know none of the above proposed mission failures actually occurred and Beagle 2 got close to the end of the sequence from wake-up to readiness for surface operations, which was composed of 78 individual tasks, conditions and events, such as the simultaneous release of three heatshield pyrotechnic release bolts.", "In the HiRISE images the lander\u2019s main parachute can be seen 100m away from the front heatshield and lander, and the lander\u2019s rear cover and drogue parachute appeared to be still attached to the probe\u2019s rear body. The airbags have still not been located but, due to their colour, are less likely to feature.", "The probe was spotted inside its target landing area in the Isidis Planitia region of Mars, about 3 miles (5 kilometres) from the heart of its target landing zone. \u2018We did land on Mars,\u2019 said Clemmet.", "The probe, a model of which can be seen in the Science Museum Exploring Space gallery , looked like a giant pocket watch, with a protective outer casing that would unfold four solar panels so Beagle 2 would get to work to hunt for signs of possible life on Mars and characterize Martian geology, weather and climate.", "To transmit and receive signals, the UHF antenna embedded in Beagle 2\u2019s lid required all solar panels to deploy successfully. One possible cause of failure is that Beagle 2 appeared not to have all of its four solar arrays deployed. However, the HiRISE images are not clear enough to be sure, since it would be difficult to see the reflection from the fourth panel due to the direction the panel was facing, said Clemmet.", "Unless we find a way to communicate with it, or indeed send another probe to study it, \u2018we may never know whether it is a broken wire, a structural distortion, a hang-up or a flat battery or one of the many other scenarios\u2019.", "The first Transformers film, in 2007, had suggested that Beagle 2 had been trampled by a Decepticon (much to Colin Pillinger\u2019s delight).

Wearing his Beagle 2 hat, Prof Wright contrasted Beagle\u2019s partial success with the failure of the ESA/Russian Schiaparelli EDM lander that crashed on Mars in 2016 \u2013 even with the resources of ESA, landing on the Red Planet is \u2018very difficult\u2019.", "Science Museum curator Doug Millard said, \u2018Beagle 2 was always a highly significant mission that needed to be represented in our Exploring Space gallery \u2013 its successful landing on Mars only adds to its importance\u2019.", "Millard added that it was now vital to document the mission, which was discussed at the meeting by Beata Bradford of the Science Museum Group\u2019s National Collections Centre, Wroughton.", "Yesterday\u2019s Science Museum meeting was \u2018nostalgic as well as formative\u2019, commented Prof John Zarnecki, who has taken part in several high-profile space probe missions.", "He remembered how his own contribution to Beagle 2 was funded by \u2018creative accounting\u2019 and the day Colin Pillinger was asked for his autograph in a Tesco petrol station and it dawned on him that, when it came to inspiring the public with space exploration, \u2018he really must have made it\u2019.", "Late 2003/early 2004 was a busy time for Mars landings. NASA\u2019s Spirit and Opportunity rovers touched down weeks apart in January 2004, on three-month missions to search for signs of past water. Spirit stopped communicating with Earth in March 2010, while contact was lost with Opportunity as of June 10, 2018.", "Prof Mark Sims closed the meeting by reminding everybody that 15 years ago the team had done something truly extraordinary and had landed a probe on Mars, \u2018even though they didn\u2019t know at the time\u2019."]},

But if we are to understand how these changes take place, and how they go awry in cases of miscarriage and pregnancy loss, we need to study human embryos.", "Many centuries had to pass before Bob Edwards achieved a revolutionary scientific milestone: the fertilization and in vitro maturation of a human egg. This achievement opened the doors for the treatment of infertile couples, but it also gave scientists the opportunity to look at human embryos developing in vitro for the first time in history .", "Upon fertilization, the human egg undergoes a series of divisions and changes in shape, culminating with the formation of an embryo, called the blastocyst, composed of approximately 200-300 cells on the 5th day of development. An embryo that reaches this stage is ready to implant into the maternal uterus, and, therefore, in IVF clinics embryos are transferred to the women\u2019s uterus on day 5. But what happens to the embryo after implantation? 30% of human embryos fail to develop normally during the first post-implantation week. Yet, since the embryos are placed in the uterus, we cannot see them or study them to provide an answer. Could we find a way around it?", "The starting point of our research was the hypothesis that human embryos could develop beyond implantation without the maternal uterus. At first this may seem unrealistic, but we already knew that mouse embryos could develop in a petri dish beyond the implantation point. And if mouse embryos could do it, why wouldn\u2019t human embryos?", "To perform these experiments we had to first seek approval from the Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority, as well as an independent ethical approval from a Research Ethics Committee. This legal framework allowed us to use surplus human embryos from IVF treatments, which were donated by couples that received informed consent.", "In our daily routine we collect, manipulate and observe mouse embryos. Watching how they develop in perfect harmony is enchanting, but it definitely does not compare to the thrill and excitement that we experienced when we cultured the first human embryos beyond day 7, day 8, day 9\u2026 and all the way up to day 13. Not only did the embryos survive and grow, they also formed various post-implantation structures. We observed the formation of the amniotic cavity, which protects the developing embryo from damage; the appearance of specialized cells that build the placenta and communicate with the mother; and the formation of a rudimentary yolk sac, which provides nutrients.", "But the excitement has just begun! We are now using this new method to understand why some embryos develop well and some others fail. We are particularly interested in understanding what happens when cells in the embryo do not have the right number of chromosomes, a phenomenon known as aneuploidy, as this is a major limitation for human reproduction. By studying human embryos that would otherwise be discarded we want to understand why so many human pregnancies fail, so we can hopefully conceive new strategies to fight infertility.", "See IVF: 6 Million Babies Later in Who Am I? until 25 November 2018.

Our only hope of the child we dreamed of would be to accept donor sperm and go down the IVF treatment route. To this day it is commonly perceived that fertility issues are down to the female. Most friends on hearing the news were quick to sympathise with my wife, not thinking that the root cause was my infertility.

Using music for mood management might be easier than ever today and highly popular with the young, but there\u2019s nothing new in the idea. When Orsino quips in Twelfth Night \u2018If music be the food of love, play on\u2019, he\u2019s doing just the same: trying to manage his infatuation with Olivia by getting an \u2018excess of it, that, surfeiting, the appetite may sicken, and so die\u2019.", "It reminds me of the way my old piano teacher \u2013 and she was very old, bless her \u2013 told me when I was learning Chopin\u2019s \u2018Funeral March\u2019 (from his Piano Sonata No. 2) that her brother would play it when he was feeling down, looking for a kind of purgative surfeit of gloom.", "How, though, does music exert this tug on our mood and emotions? Why can it make us feel like dancing? Why, when the schmaltzy strings kick in during that corny death scene (Beaches, I\u2019m looking at you), are we utterly unable to hold back the tears? This is what I\u2019ll be exploring with maestro jazz pianist Joe Stilgoe with the input of the IMAX audience at the Science Museum Lates on 25 July .", "***", "I suspect there\u2019s a common perception that emotion in music is different from cognition of music. Cognition sounds cool and rational \u2013 Ah, what splendid use of counterpoint in this fugue! \u2013 while emotion is raw, coming from the gut rather than the mind and beyond analysis.", "But that\u2019s not right. Many psychologists and neuroscientists now argue that emotion isn\u2019t separate from, and indeed in opposition to, rational thought, but is important for good decision-making. Emotion is simply a part of how we think and make sense of the world; without it, our thinking may be impaired. With music that is more clear than ever: much of the emotional impact stems from the stunning intuition we develop, even without any formal musical training, about the structure and patterns in what we hear.", "Maybe, though, you are suspicious of claims that we can understand musical emotion because it seems so subjective. There is nothing like music for eliciting the dismissive comment \u2018each to his own\u2019 \u2013 most of us have had the experience of feeling indifferent about music that renders others ecstatic, and vice versa. We\u2019re not even consistent in our own responses: how a piece of music makes us feel could vary depending on the circumstances in which we hear it.", "Does this mean that musical emotion is doomed to remain forever too personal and mysterious, beyond the reach of systematic analysis?", "Apparently not \u2013 because some aspects of musical emotion do seem universal. Western listeners turn out to be pretty good at judging whether happiness or sadness is intended in music from unfamiliar cultures, such as Kyrghistani, Hindustani and Navajo Native American, while people from a remote tribe in the Cameroon who had never heard Western music proved to agree with Western listeners more often than chance in assessing which extracts of Western music were happy, sad and fearful.", "Where does this apparent universality in designators of musical mood come from? Think of Ann Ronell\u2019s great 1932 song \u2018Willow Weep for Me\u2019, which has been sung by everyone from Billie Holiday to Ella Fitzgerald and Nina Simone. It\u2019s a melancholy song, and for much the same reason that we say willows \u2018weep\u2019. Just as the trees look like a weeping person, with a slouched, drooping physiognomy, some broad characteristics of musical emotion seem to mimic in music the physicality of that emotion in people, particularly in speech and gesture.", "When most listeners agree that music is sad, it is likely to be slow and soft \u2013 rather like the way sad people tend to move and speak. This doesn\u2019t mean that all slow, soft music is sad, but that few people from just about any culture would find Handel\u2019s Music for the Royal Fireworks sad. Similarly, music commonly designated \u2018happy\u2019 tends to be relatively fast-paced and jaunty, and at a moderately loud volume. These purely acoustic properties allow simple emotional messages to be easily discerned on the \u2018surface\u2019 of the music.", "But while studies like this might offer hints about the crudest, most generalized components of the musical emotional palette, they don\u2019t come close to telling us what it is about music that truly excites the passions.", "A plausible theory of how that happens was developed in the 1950s by the musicologist Leonard Meyer. He proposed that we feel emotion in music when we have expectations about the way the music will go that are frustrated or violated, even if just fleetingly.", "You might think that if music is constantly violating our expectations, we\u2019d find listening irritating and unpleasant. But music is constantly meeting our expectations too: tonal music retains its sense of key, there are plenty of repetitions and rhythmic regularity and so on. The idea is that, if our expectations are momentarily foiled and then met, the payoff is greater than if gratification is instant. We experience tension and then release, which is far more satisfying than just bland predictability.", "", "These violations of expectation seem to take a shortcut to the \u2019emotional brain\u2019 without the intervention of the rational brain. That may well say something about the evolutionary origins of the effect: we are instinctive pattern-seekers, adapted through evolution to make predictions about our environment and to feel rewards when they are correct. Even when this prediction involves the course of a Mozart sonata rather than the identification of a dangerous animal, we can\u2019t turn off this hardwired anticipatory instinct. And because it presumably had a survival function, we may not have been able to afford the time to sit back and logically reason whether an emotional response was really warranted \u2013 we had to react at once to what our instincts told us. So even though we \u2018know\u2019 what is coming, the emotional response still arrives. That\u2019s why these tricks keep working over repeated listens \u2013 we don\u2019t get bored by music we\u2019ve heard before.", "Meyer showed how music \u2013 not just Western classical music, but that of diverse cultures \u2013 is filled with little deviations from the obvious, violations of expectation that lend spice to a piece and engage our emotions. The skill of composing music that engages us then lies in getting the balance right: in allowing us to develop expectations, and then in providing just the right mixture of violation and gratification. If the music is too obvious, it bores us. If it is too chaotic or disjointed to allow us to develop any expectations at all, it merely baffles and frustrates us.", "This principle of deviating from expectation for expressive purposes is found in non-Western traditions too. Blues and jazz musicians, meanwhile, often use it by making the pitch of certain notes ambiguous. That\u2019s particularly common on the so-called blue notes, which are the third and the seventh notes of the Western scales. Because in jazz and blues these notes have an inherently imprecise pitch, they are the obvious and most common ones used for expressive purposes by bending the pitch. The importance of being able to manipulate the intonation in this way no doubt explains why the guitar, on which notes can be bent by pulling on the strings, has been so central to the blues. Likewise the saxophone to jazz, where pitch bending comes from breath control on the reed. It\u2019s harder on the fixed pitches of the piano \u2013 with the help of the Science Museum IMAX audience, I want to see what Joe Stilgoe can do about that!", "***", "The most wonderful thing about music\u2019s ability to evoke emotion is that it works for almost all of us, and we don\u2019t even need to put any work in to acquire that receptiveness. We just have to listen for the sheer enjoyment of it. Our incredible, pattern-seeking brain does the rest, without our even noticing. Mastering musical composition or performance is hard work, and we\u2019ve been encouraged to see it as a rare gift. But a capacity for musicality is not a rare gift at all. It\u2019s something that we all possess to some degree or other. It\u2019s a part of being human.", "Join Joe Stilgoe and Philip Ball at The Science of Music and Mood at this month\u2019s Lates on Wednesday 25 July, set to be an inspirational evening of music, improvisation,\u00a0science and audience participation.

The medical experience of 1914-1918 and the implications for the years that followed is a vast and complex narrative. Even by concentrating our exhibition on the Western Front and the British experience, we have had to pick out key strands and themes from what was a multi-faceted story. And it is not a simple case of the \u2018triumph of medicine\u2019. While real medical innovation did arise as new techniques and strategies were pioneered, others were rediscovered, or adapted and evolved through experience. Many mistakes were also made and time and again medical services were simply overwhelmed by both the nature and the sheer scale of casualties.", "Two objects which epitomise some of these ambiguities are an extremely rare blood transfusion set, which we believe to be one of the earliest practical designs for use on British wounded, and an artificial arm. The blood transfusion set represented a major advance in medical treatment that arrived late in the war but proved the life-saving potential of what is now a standard procedure in emergency medicine.", "Conversely, we are also displaying an artificial arm that was much coveted during the war for its apparent technological sophistication, but through the experiences of those who used it was ultimately found to be wanting. Initially imported from America, the Carne arm was an expensive item that became known as the \u2018officer\u2019s arm\u2019 as only officers tended to get them.\u00a0 In practice, wearers found them heavy and difficult to master, and many soon ended up in the backs of cupboards \u2013 never to be worn again.", "A century on, the nature of warfare has been transformed.

For the plastics and the glass, that loss comes from paper labels and glues that are soaked off in the washing process, forming an unpleasant sticky mulch which gets sent to incineration. Even for the steel and aluminium cans which can be endlessly recycled, there is still some loss from the paints and pigments used in printing their branded logos and decoration.", "As processes improve and new technology is developed, hopefully, one day these materials will either be captured for future use, or the waste will be designed out altogether.

He was said to be good-looking, though his plump figure inspired from one cousin the rather unkind nickname, \u2018the fat Lord\u2019. Nevertheless, they were well matched, sharing scientific interests.", "The 1840s was an eventful decade for the Parsons. They became Lord and Lady Rosse in 1841, taking charge of the ancestral home, Birr Castle, in the Irish midlands. \u00a0Mary embarked upon a series of architectural projects at the castle, from the construction of a star-shaped moat to a new tower.

The silence over her contribution in Lord Rosse\u2019s account, they speculated, was owing to Mary wishing for her husband to get full credit.", "The Parsons did much to help their community during the Great Famine. Mary\u2019s charitable work was acknowledged by the Illustrated London News , who reported \u2018she has taken the most lively interest in the poor\u2019.

Among the many famous men of science she became acquainted with was the famous mathematician William Hamilton , who gave her a sonnet about his experience of gazing through the Leviathan.", "Mary is best known for her pioneering photography, which she began in late 1853, experimenting with different photographic processes. Her surviving darkroom at the castle is one of the oldest in Europe.", "When Lord Rosse sent some of her early work to Henry Fox Talbot , one of the inventors of photography, he replied \u2018pray give my thanks to Lady Rosse for her very interesting specimens of photography\u2019 and asked to have them displayed at the first show of the (later Royal) Photographic Society in London.", "Mary would become an acknowledged expert in waxed-paper photography, winning the inaugural silver medal of the Photographic Society of Ireland in 1859.\u00a0 Her subjects varied from family portraits and landscapes to beautiful images of the telescope, such as this one with Lord Rosse in top hat standing in its mouth, and the one below featuring her children.", "See the giant mirror of the Great Rosse Telescope up close when it makes its move next month into Science Museum\u2019s Making the Modern World gallery."]},

It was the beginning, the first step on the ladder, but it was the genius of Arthur Pearson that realised that\u2026\u2019", "Ian Fraser, who was blinded at the Somme, also appreciated the watch, which was brought to him in Pearson\u2019s absence by his assistant Irene Mace. Fraser wrote in his autobiography that:", "\u2018The value of the watch to me far exceeded its usefulness. That in itself was considerable, for you tend to want to know the time often when you are in permanent darkness, and have no means of distinguishing even night from day. Of course, in hospital, one could always ask. But that was the whole point. With this watch I did not have to ask anyone. I would never have to ask again. I was able to do it myself \u2013 do something that had before always been a visual act. It was an extraordinary pleasure to find that it was just as easy to do with the hands as with the eyes. Perhaps there were other things\u2026\u2019", "Fraser is a wonderful example of the many \u2018other things\u2019 our blind veterans have gone on to do. He not only became Chairman of the charity but an MP, a member of the House of Lords and a BBC governor. And he married Irene Mace.", "Today our blind veterans are still given watches when they start their journey with the charity, but technology has moved on and usually they are talking watches. However at least one still uses a Braille watch: Peter Price, who joined us in 2010, always carries with him the watch of his grandfather Ernest Sayers. Ernest enlisted in 1916 and lost his sight whilst serving in the Royal Army Service Corps and was also supported by the charity.", "Blind Veterans UK is delighted to collaborate with the Science Museum on the Wounded: Conflict, Casualties and Care exhibition.

The planned move of the Royal Photographic Society collection to the Victoria & Albert Museum has generated much heated comment and reignited understandable soul searching about the north-south divide. Yet Priestley himself remarked that he had \u2018always been delighted at the prospect of a new day, a fresh try, one more start\u2019, and that is precisely what is now dawning at the Museum.", "The tale of loss, even of cultural vandalism, being put about by some is simply wrong. The Science Museum Group\u2019s Board of Trustees has thought long and hard about the future of the National Media Museum and the reality is of a museum that is firmly rooted in its community with a major photographic collection (which will still include three million images), vibrant plans for new galleries and bold new programming that, despite the tough economic backdrop, is already arresting years of decline. It is a story of gains, confidence and ambition.", "The National Media Museum is one of the great museums within the Science Museum Group. With four museums north of Liverpool, we have the most northerly centre of gravity of all the national museum groups, and have consistently backed this up with investment. Our Group founded the world`s greatest railway museum in York (the one that brought Flying Scotsman back to life), created a national museum in Bradford, rescued the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester when its future was in doubt, and worked with Durham County Council to create a railway museum in Shildon. We have bold plans for a new special exhibition gallery in Manchester and, to complement the huge York Central development, a bold new vision for the National Railway Museum. Moreover, about half of our staff live and work in a variety of northern towns and cities.", "Within our museum Group, this year\u2019s star performer has been the National Media Museum, with audiences up 11% on last year. So why has it broken a pattern of steady and ominous decline? It\u2019s all about STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), notably moving the science of light, image and sound to centre stage in the museum since 2013. The increased focus on science is already working and reconnecting the Museum to the communities closest to it \u2013 the children, students and families of Bradford and West Yorkshire.", "This fresh focus came after careful consultation and received strong public backing from key partners in the town: the University of Bradford, Bradford College and, crucially, Bradford Metropolitan District Council, which is investing \u00a31 million in the Museum specifically for science education. The 2015 summer exhibition \u2013 Light Fantastic \u2013 offered a tantalising picture of the potential of Bradford\u2019s premier cultural attraction, with impressive visitor numbers and a compelling new take on physics. Just last month the partnership with Horrible Science brought nearly 30,000 visitors to the Museum in nine days. People in Bradford are voting with their feet.", "Our minds and money should be devoted to building on this success. That is why the move of the Royal Photographic Society (RPS) collection \u2013 around ten per cent of the Museum\u2019s photography collections \u2013 to the Victoria & Albert Museum makes such sense. This collection contains extremely fragile and delicate negatives and prints which must be kept in carefully controlled environmental conditions. Its many archive boxes have scant connections with the city and region and they were visited by fewer than 500 researchers last year. The collection is truly great but in the past decade or so we have not been able to allocate sufficient resources to do it full justice.", "We could have opted for a quiet life but decided to take a tough look at a question that few museums would dare to ask: is there a better home for this collection, given we cannot do everything we would like? We looked for somewhere with significant resources, expertise and reach, both nationally and internationally. The Victoria & Albert Museum has fantastic plans to create an international photography centre and a commitment to make more of the collection by working with the National Media Museum, as well as completely digitising it. The collection will be accessible in the V&A\u2019s Study Rooms, which were visited by 35,000 people last year, and will join their programme of national tours: over the past decade they have toured 23 photographic exhibitions which have been seen by 1.5 million people across the country.", "An important point that many observers have overlooked is that the RPS collection only headed to Bradford thirteen years ago because the Royal Photographic Society couldn\u2019t afford to look after it properly in their headquarters in Bath. The transfer to London has been welcomed by Dr Michael Pritchard, Director-General of the Society, who told us he was \u2018pleased we can further enhance the RPS Collection\u2019s stature alongside the V&A\u2019s own art photography collection and make it more widely available to the public and scholars \u2026", "The RPS is extremely fortunate to benefit from the support and expertise of one of the world\u2019s most revered cultural institutions.\u201d Moreover, as the RPS itself pointed out, the move represents a homecoming and reunion for some of these images, which were once part of a single collection at the 19th century South Kensington Museum before it divided into the V&A and the Science Museum. On learning of the proposed transfer in early December last year, Michael put on record some expectations such as maintaining commitments over access, ongoing digitisation and that the collection would remain a distinct entity, intellectually and physically \u2013 areas all addressed through the V&A\u2019s plans. \u2018Assuming agreement on those points,\u2019 he said \u2018the RPS offered its support for the transfer as being in the best interests of the RPS collection\u2019.", "The National Media Museum still faces challenges, among them a name that has never connected with existing and potential audiences. This is why the Group has committed to supporting the museum, by raising \u00a37.5 million over a five-year period to fund a new interactive gallery, an innovative sphere on which to display the latest satellite imagery, and new galleries filled with its most extraordinary collections of film, animation, TV and photographic technology. Glorious collections will move from the basement stores to public display. These are gains for the public.", "And there is more. The science focus is proving so fruitful that the Group will move prize items of key cultural importance (including landmark technology by Herschel, Marconi and Wheatstone) from London to be displayed in the new galleries. We are also committed to working with a wide range of partners to develop new festivals and support the cultural life of the region.", "Our Bradford museum is not a \u2018satellite\u2019 of our Group, as some have put it, but an equal partner. To underline this, the Board of Trustees had its latest strategy meeting in Bradford and, only last week, the Group held its biggest annual gathering of staff in the museum and adjoining council offices.", "To conclude, we are building a better museum, one that will remain a cultural powerhouse.

However, his follow up article in 1911 and Aims of Astronauts in 1914 aroused wider interest by discussing two key problems: rocket motors and interplanetary communication.", "Unlike Goddard and Oberth, Tsiolkovsky never built an actual rocket.

For Tsiokovsky the goal of space exploration was to achieve universal happiness.", "Cosmic fascination was by then commonplace.

Consequently their schedules were gruelling, and their image and behaviour carefully controlled; private lives ceased to be private.", "Like the first man in space , Yuri Gagarin, Tereshkova wanted to fly again but was considered too important as a propaganda tool. Gagarin and Tereshkova\u2019s value partly lay in qualities identified already at their initial selection; both came from modest backgrounds, were diligent students, model workers, politically loyal and personable. They were now celebrated as the communist dream come true.", "Tereshkova\u2019s public image differed from Gagarin\u2019s however and was strictly gendered. While Gagarin was portrayed as a military hero in uniform, Tereshkova was shown with immaculate hair and make-up, wearing feminine dresses and high heels. In this way she came to embody the civilian, peaceful aspect of space travel.", "In the early 1960s Soviet women were also encouraged to combine good work ethics and political commitment with femininity and a sense of style. Official accounts of Tereshkova consequently tried to reconcile her aptitude for science and technology with being feminine and chic.\u00a0 To quote R.P. Sylvester , \u201c[\u2026] drab was out and Dior was most definitely in\u201d.", "While Tereshkova\u2019s accomplishment was held by many as living proof of gender equality under Communism, it soon became apparent that there was a lack of real commitment to continued female participation on the Soviet space program.

It was designed to link both the United States and Canada to the UK, with facilities for some circuits to be leased to other West European countries too.", "The cable \u00a0provided 30 telephone circuits to the US and six to Canada. Most were for communication with the UK, the rest were connected through London to give direct access to Europe.", "Undertaken by BT\u2019s predecessor, the Post Office Engineering Department , along with the American Telegraph and Telephone Company , Bell Telephone Laboratories and the Canadian Overseas Telecommunications Corporation , the \u00a312.5 million project took three years to complete. During this time the system was planned, manufactured and installed, which required developing new techniques for placing cable in deep waters.", "Telegraph links between the UK and the USA had been in existence from the middle of the previous century, but 1927 saw the first commercial radiotelephone service between the two countries. Initially 2,000 calls per year were made across the Atlantic, but the cost was prohibitive \u2013 in 1928 the basic rate for calls to New York was \u00a39 for just three minutes.", "It was only with the development of new equipment, such as coaxial cables with polyethylene insulation, carrier frequency equipment and broadband submerged repeaters, that transatlantic telephony by cable could be realised. These new technologies were developed just before and during World War Two. One key Post Office input was the development of subsea repeaters which were robust and reliable enough for areas around the coast and mainland Europe.", "Apart from the short shore ends, the whole of the transatlantic telephone cable was laid by the Post Office cable ship Monarch. It was the only such ship that was capable of carrying the 1,500 nautical miles of cable which had to be laid in one piece across the deepest part of the Atlantic, between Oban in Scotland and Clarenville, Newfoundland. The cable then crossed over the the Cabot Strait to Sydney Mines, Nova Scotia.", "At the inaugural ceremony at \u00a0Lancaster House in London on 25 September 1956, the service was opened by the Postmaster General, who spoke to the Chairman of AT&T calling from New York, and to the Canadian Minister of Transport.", "During its first year of service, TAT1 carried twice as many calls as the radio circuits had done in a year \u2013 about 220,000 calls between Britain and the United States, and 75,000 between Britain and Canada \u2013 generating \u00a32 million to be shared between the three countries.", "In 1956, the first transatlantic telephone cable was regarded as a major technological achievement, not least as a base for future research and improvements. It laid the path for further developments such as sophisticated digital fibre optic transatlantic cables, which can pass tens of thousands of calls simultaneously.", "BT is excited to be Lead Principal Sponsor of the new Science Museum\u2019s Information Age gallery, where the story of TAT1 and transatlantic communications is told.

These emotional sounds (such as crying, screaming, laughing) are more like animal calls than they are like speech.", "Our more recent voluntary system is associated with speech and song (and other vocal skills such as beatboxing). If this system is damaged, for example, due to a stroke, people can be left with aphasia \u2013 a persistent problem with talking. They very often can still make emotional noises, such as laughing, suggesting that the stroke has not damaged this older pathway.", "For my research , we are studying what it means to make voluntary and involuntary vocalizations \u2013 for example, laughter is used a great deal during conversational speech. Even babies use emotional expressions like crying and laughter in extremely sophisticated ways.", "This all suggests that there may be both voluntary and involuntary kinds of emotional sounds. Are laughs and sobs produced in a voluntary or an involuntary fashion really different? How do they sound to us? How does this change as we age?", "To help discover the answers to these questions, we are running an experiment at the Science Museum.

Six different types of quark have been discovered and they can form a large number of different combinations, explaining the particle zoo.", "However, quarks only bind together in very specific ways. Two ways in fact. One option is a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois known as a baryon . Baryons include the proton and the neutron, the building blocks of the atomic nucleus. The other option is where a quark and an antiquark couple up to form a meson .", "The X didn\u2019t fit easily into either of these pictures. This generated a lot of excitement and there was speculation as to whether it could be an ordinary meson, or some new exotic combination involving four quarks, a tetraquark, or a \u201cmolecule\u201d of two mesons stuck together.", "If this were true it would be the first time such an exotic state had been definitively seen in nature.", "The only way to tell would be to measure the quantum numbers of the X, three properties that give a clue to its internal structure.

The result was emphatic \u2013 the X is not a meson, it is something altogether more exotic.", "LHCb physicist Dr Matt Needham told me that \u201cthis measurement is a great step forward in understanding this mysterious X\u201d and a \u201cvery exciting result\u201d. However, there is still work to be done.", "\u201cThe real nature (of the X) is still unclear\u201d. Whether it\u2019s a tetraquark, meson molecule or something else entirely must now be determined.", "His colleagues at LHCb will now search for signs of the X decaying in new ways to try to separate out the various different options. Although the Large Hadron Collider has now shut down for two years physicists at LHCb will have no shortage of data to work with. An unprecedented sample was collected during 2012, corresponding to 180 trillion collisions, each one producing hundreds of particles.", "The true nature of this enigmatic particle may soon be known. Whatever the result, we have now had our first glimpse of an altogether new state of matter.

The Higgs boson was one of the longest-sought prizes in science \u2013 it was almost fifty years ago in 1964 that three groups of theorists laid the ground-work for what would become the final piece of the theory known as the Standard Model of Particle Physics. They proposed an energy field, filling the entire Universe that gives mass to fundamental particles.", "This \u201cHiggs mechanism\u201d neatly explained why the weak nuclear force was so weak and why light is able to travel over infinite reaches of space.

It was Peter Higgs who first suggested that if the field existed, it would be possible to create such a disturbance, which would show up as a new particle. Hence, the boson was named after him, much to the irritation of some of the other five theorists responsible for the theory.", "The LHC\u2019s discovery of the Higgs closed a chapter in the development of fundamental physics, placing the keystone into the great arch of the Standard Model.

It was created in 1969 by EMS ( Electronic Music Studios ), a company founded by Peter Zinovieff. The team at EMS used a combination of computer programming knowledge, advanced engineering and musical ambition to create a brand new instrument for all to use. The electronics were largely designed by David Cockrell and the machine\u2019s distinctive visual appearance was the work of electronic composer Tristram Cary.", "The VCS3 was notoriously difficult to program but, a year before the appearance of the Minimoog and ARP2600 , it brought synthesis within the reach of the public. It sold for \u00a3330 and became very popular in a short space of time. By the mid \u201970s, the VCS3 (and its little brother, the suitcase-bound model AKS ) had become something of a classic and was used by many famous bands like Pink Floyd, Yes, The Who and Roxy Music .", "This unique instrument allowed musicians to experiment with a range of new sounds never before available to them. Along with other early synthesisers it came to shape \u2018the sound of the future\u2019 in the \u201860s and \u201870s, and with further developments came the drum machines of the \u201880s setting the foundation for electronic dance music. Much of the music we take for granted today would not be possible without the pioneering work of groups like EMS and as long as there are developments in technology, there will always be people applying these innovations to music. Inventor Steve Mann has developed many interesting instruments such as the hydraulophone which uses pressurised water to make sounds, while artist and scientist Ariel Garten uses an electroencephalophone to turn brainwaves into music.", "What sort of instrument do you think will make the sound of our future?", "The VCS3 Synthesiser can be found in the Oramics to Electronica exhibition, on the second floor of the Science Museum."]},

On that day both Alexander Graham Bell and Elisha Gray filed\u00a0papers\u00a0with the US Patent Office\u00a0for a working telephone. Following a dispute Bell\u2019s patent was granted and published on the 7th of March 1876. Recently some historians have suggested that the dispute may have been resolved so quickly because Bell found a way to incorporate some of Gray\u2019s ideas into his patent applications \u2013 but what could have driven Bell to such\u00a0deception?", "Only three months earlier Bell had been forced to make a difficult decision; should he choose to marry the love of his life, or continue work\u00a0on his\u00a0telephone? Bell\u2019s day job was teaching deaf people to speak, and his interest in the production of sounds had stimulated an interest in electrical science. He had been researching a \u2018harmonic telegraph\u2019 and, since June 1875, investigating the telephone after an accidental discovery that enabled him to transmit and receive sounds. The father of Mabel Hubbard, one of Bell\u2019s students, became interested in Bell\u2019s harmonic telegraph and offered financial support which Bell accepted while also remaining committed to his teaching. Meanwhile, Bell was becoming aware that his feelings for Mabel were turning from a teacher and pupil relationship towards those of love for her.", "Bell\u2019s decision came in November 1875\u00a0when Mabel\u2019s father, Gardiner Hubbard, asked Bell to give up teaching and other researches and devote all his time to the telegraph. If he did so, Hubbard would provide his living expenses enabling Bell to marry. Bell\u00a0was too proud to accept\u00a0a handout and rejected the offer, writing:", "You are Mabel\u2019s father and I will not urge you to give \u2013 nor will I accept it if offered \u2013 any pecuniary assistance other than that we agreed upon before my affection for Mabel was known \u2026 I shall certainly not relinquish my profession until I find something more profitable (which shall be difficult) nor until I have qualified others to work in the same field.", "Fortunately for Bell the Hubbard family accepted the situation and allowed Mabel to make up her own mind.\u00a0Two days later she and Bell became engaged.", "Although Bell had not been prepared to accept Gardiner Hubbard\u2019s money, he took the hint and looked again at the harmonic telegraph. Alongside this work he also continued research into the telephone against Gardiner Hubbard\u2019s wishes, for he was convinced he could make it work. His work on the telephone gained some urgency when he became aware that he had a competitor in Elisha Gray, and furthermore because he still did not have enough money to marry Mabel. Bell\u2019s submission of his patent papers on the 14 February, the same day as Gray submitted his, shows how close the race was. If Bell\u00a0did indeed\u00a0make illicit additions to his papers, perhaps it is because he was driven by his desire to marry Mabel Hubbard, which he finally did in July 1877."]},

Who doesn\u2019t want to be smarter, faster at solving problems, more productive at work, or better at remembering names?", "Imagine if you could do all the above simply by playing a few games online, or on an app, for a few minutes a day. That is the promise of brain training games. Games that could help prevent age-related memory decline, like dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Games that could help you perform better at home, work, and school. Games that could increase your IQ and improve your mood.", "The promise of brain training relies on the scientific concept of neuroplasticity, the fact that the brain changes throughout life, not simply by growing more neurons but actually changing the way these neurons work. For example, London black cab drivers have a bigger hippocampus, the part of the brain that stores memories of places, and professional musicians have larger auditory cortices, the part of the brain that processes sound.", "The easiest way to understand neuroplasticity is by picturing the brain as a muscle.\u00a0The more you exercise that muscle, the stronger that muscle becomes. If you want to run a marathon, you need to start jogging, and you need to build up your fitness with consistent practice. Similarly, you can view brain training as neurobics, a workout for your neurons. Neurobics has become extremely popular (and big business) in little more than a decade, yet science still has a very hard time with answering the question \u2018Do these games work?\u2019", "Personally, I have tried some of the brain training games and apps out there, and I\u2019ll admit, they\u2019re fun and engaging. I\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t secretly pleased to see my scores go up every time, hoping this reflects my brain\u2019s health. Yet the scientist in me remains skeptical.", "Yes, playing a game that asks you to recall as many words that start with the letters \u2018BR\u2019 as possible for 5 minutes every day will make you quicker at coming up with words that start with \u2018BR\u2019 and will probably expand your vocabulary with many more words that start with those letters. But will it make you better at writing that essay for school or\u00a0 report for work? Will it prevent dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s?", "Well, probably not. In the same way that jogging for 10 minutes every day will not make you a better dancer or a football player. A point further determined by Professor Adrian Owen of The Brain and Mind Institute, Western University, Canada, who said: \u201cAs we showed in our Nature study in 2010 on 11,000 people who brain trained for a full six weeks, they got better at every single task they trained on. But amazingly, they didn\u2019t get better at any other tasks at all, including some that appeared to be very similar to the trained tasks.\u201d And it\u2019s this lack of generalisability of brain training games to the real and complex world that causes scientists to caution against neurobics .", "For me, it wasn\u2019t the lack of evidence that stopped me from continuing neurobics \u2013 I play plenty of games that have no scientific foundation of benefit what so ever (Candy Crush, I\u2019m looking at you). It was the fact that I\u2019d rather spend those 10 minutes a day being out in the world, interacting with people, learning new skills and doing physical exercise \u2013 all complex tasks that I know for certain use a myriad of brain functions at the same time, therefore exercising my brain without any conscious effort.", "Have you given brain training a try?

In order to avoid introducing a pollutant source ourselves, we take special care to select the materials we use in our collection storage and display areas.", "However, there is another source of pollutants we encounter in museums: the objects themselves. The Science Museum Group collection has a vast array of fascinating complex objects. Unfortunately, many of these objects are made from a combination of materials which, despite looking beautiful, are not the best suited to be in proximity with one another.", "Examples of these challenging combinations include elegant 18th century medical kits and scientific instruments, such as the syringe set above, that are stored in fabric lined wooden boxes. These kits usually contain metallic elements, which are likely to corrode due to sulphur gases. These gases are emitted by fabrics such as wool, a common choice for lining in these cases.", "The fabric itself is vulnerable to acids, including those which can be emitted from certain types of acidic woods like oak, a commonly used material for storage boxes. Moreover, wood\u2019s acidic emissions can also cause corrosion on the metallic elements.", "Plastics and rubber are other examples of materials that emit pollutants which can harm other elements within the objects. Good examples of these are objects from our prosthetics collection. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from degrading rubber can accelerate the deterioration of leather or metal elements in the object.", "In the Conservation and Collections Care team, one of our tasks is to mitigate the pollutants affecting our collection as much as possible, even when the objects themselves are the source.", "Maintaining suitable environmental conditions is key. High relative humidity can make some materials more susceptible to absorb pollutants, whilst high temperature can accelerate chemical reactions and exacerbate the damage they cause. It is also important to limit the amount of external air that comes into areas with collections and the use of air filtration units in stores with large amounts of objects that produce harmful emissions.", "This is just some of the work we do behind the scenes to ensure that we can continue to inspire our visitors with the objects in our collection.

Ancient peoples knew for example that when Orion started to appear more visible winter would soon arrive, or they would see the Summer Triangle and know that Spring and Summer were coming as well.

In our\u00a0exhibition Illuminating India: 5000 Years of Science and Innovation , you can find some coins depicting constellations, dating back to time of the Mughal Emperor Jahangir (1569-1627). Having constellations on coins was quite unusual as this accolade was typically saved for Gods and Goddesses, Kings and Conquerors, and thus shows us the importance that astronomy had under Jahangir\u2019s rule.", "It was only in 1922 that astronomers in the International Astronomical Union (IAU) agreed on a universal set of 88 official constellations, up until that point depending on where you were in the world the names and boundaries would vary widely. The official 88 constellations depict 42 animals, 29 inanimate objects and 17 humans or mythological characters.", "However various other unofficial patterns have existed alongside these, and are formally known as \u2018asterisms\u2019. This got us wondering about the difference in the night sky between the UK and India. The two countries sit at very different latitudes, with the UK in Northern Europe, and India bordering the equator, so we assumed that the constellations would look different, as the view you get is based on both the revolution of the Earth around the sun, and its rotation on its tilted axis, but we weren\u2019t entirely sure how they would look.", "It turns out they look pretty different\u2026", "It was fascinating comparing the two constellation maps and tracing the shapes in the stars, and it made us want to create our own, and so we came up with the Constellation Coasters workshop.", "At the workshop, your stars will be colourful pins that you can push through either side of a coaster, before using string to create your own constellation by joining the pins up.", "", "Constellation Coasters is just one of many activities we\u2019ve put together for visitors at the Illuminating India: Family Festival .

Along the way she has to make some difficult moral decisions in creating a hybrid creature to provide donor organs.", "Or, to be more precise, you will have to make some difficult decisions.", "", "The film is my reaction to Frankenstein . I have always been interested in the relationship between the audience and the creature; specifically how it changes over time. As a teenager I think most people identify with the creature \u2013 feeling uncomfortable in your body and alienated from everyone else. As you get older (and become a parent) I think you identify a lot more with the relationship Victor has with the creature. This relationship of parent and child and how it is mirrored in human/animal relationships is at the core of what I wanted to explore. In my research for the film I came up against some very interesting and difficult ideas. For example, certain organs are sold on the black market (the average price of a kidney is $5000) and this in effect stops the need for research into creating them in a lab \u2013 this is why, in Pandemic , hearts are affected. Similarly, I was surprised by how much ego and interpersonal relationships can affect decision making. This was really born out in the screenings \u2013 most audience members made decisions based on how they related to other characters rather than making the more logical choice.", "With Pandemic ,\u00a0I wanted to make the audience spend time with the creatures that they create. The idea that even though they will ultimately be sacrificed, you will need to care for them for a certain period of time; you will have to be physically near them to observe their lives while saving more distant and abstract lives. It is this living with your decisions that interested me in an interactive format \u2013 once you have made a decision, you will have to watch it play out. And it might not play out how you want it to. This is why I think Pandemic worked so well in an auditorium. While playing Pandemic at home, you may go backwards or take a glimpse at other possibilities, but in the auditorium the audience were locked in their decisions. We used a simple system of red and white cards to define the yes/no answers. What originally felt like quite a lo-fi piece of technology actually proved to be one of the most interesting facets of the film. I would say 90% of audience members looked to see how others were voting and 20% or so would change their decision based on this. In the film there is an early scene (no spoilers) where the Department of Health talks about the need for public consultation. A few audience members reflected on how they were swayed by what others thought rather than what they knew was \u2018right\u2019. This raises some interesting questions about how public engagement works \u2013 is it what people really believe or what they think they should believe?", "Pandemic has been an amazing project, from being able to talk to scientists at the cutting edge of their field to directing Jenny Agutter over Skype. The whole thing has been wonderful, weird and brilliant. To be able to make something that touches an audience and makes them think is a rare privilege indeed.", "For anyone interested in the workings behind the film \u2013 there are over 70 different videos in Pandemic , making up over an hour of distinct and different content. We shot for 7 days in Worcester and Kidderminster. At times putting this film together has felt like four-dimensional chess. I hope you enjoy it!", "", "Pandemic was created by John Bradburn in collaboration with the Science Museum.", "Warning: this film contains themes related to creating artificial life, moderate psychological threat and horror sequences that some people may find disturbing.

Cheaper to buy and ideal for travelling around busy streets, the new carriage became an instant success with middle-class and wealthy families.", "The carriage was designed to be cosy and intimate with space for two forward-facing passengers inside and room for a third next to the coachmen.

In our first, very quick and dirty playtest\u00a0we were howling with laughter\u00a0\u2013 it looked like\u00a0we were on to something.", "However, we were concerned that all we\u2019d done was shift a familiar game into a new environment and we wanted something a bit more novel. So suddenly it got a bit political. We would divide our players into two teams \u2013 the scientists and the politicians. The politicians want to stop funding research and the scientists have to convince them that they deserve the money, but they might be bluffing\u2026", "Basic concept sorted we headed out to start playtesting in earnest.

We took some pictures of crazy looking objects and asked people to write down their ideas. We then got the gamemaster to read them all out, along with the real answer. Again there were lots of problems. The gamemaster struggled to read out the descriptions in dodgy handwriting, and the real answers were really easy to spot.", "But then it came together. On our third go we decided that half the fun was picking the objects out in the first place, so after assigning teams an area of the gallery we asked them to go away and take photos on their mobiles. They had to select objects that would be fun to bluff about, or that had descriptions that were so outlandish that people might not believe them.", "Two or three teams take turns to describe an object and the others\u00a0ask probing questions to try to catch them out.

Can you say something about the shift in the focus of your practice, from bits and bytes and\u00a0online environments to \u2018(art) marketable products\u2019, perhaps starting with a brief outline of what net art is (or was)?", "Well net art was an avant-garde movement in the 90\u2019s;\u00a0that came to life after the emergence of the internet. I think net art was an ultimate modernism, an art practice that existed without institutional borders and was addressed to everyone (who had a computer and internet). I believe many of the net artists\u2019 inventions were later used in construction of \u201cweb 2.0\u201d which marries social networking and online shopping.", "I think net art had served its role in the development of\u00a0online capitalism and has become marginal around 2002-03. In the virtual world dominated by heavily controlled social/ commercial sites such as Facebook and eBay very little space is left for artistic exploration. That was one reason for me to search for the new. Another one was that by that time I was looking for new economical conditions of art production and making \u201ccommercial\u201d, art-market ready art appeared to be the best option. Especially considering the almost non-existent support of art by the state in Russia where I was living by then. I was lucky to meet Aristarkh Cernyshev then and we decided to make a project together, Super-I real Virtuality Goggles . It went really well and we decided to go on with a collaboration, formed Electroboutique, rented a studio together and started developing our unique style on the intersection of pop art, design and interactive electronics, something that has not existed yet in the market.", "What is the significance for you of this exhibition being in a Science Museum rather than an art gallery? How do you think the museum context and its very wide general audience might change the way the works will be experienced or received?", "Yes, the Science Museum is great for us! Firstly, as I have already said before, the Science Museum\u00a0shows at its best an unbreakable connection between history of capitalism, science, engineering, and design. With\u00a0the Science Museum\u00a0art programme we get all ingredients: we consider art an important institute of a capitalist society, one of its driving forces. This unity of art and capitalism is one of the focuses of our artistic exploration, which is why the Science Museum context works so well for us. And of course, being real modernists, we want to bring our art to the masses, to ordinary people, and not just to the snobbish art crowd. And where on earth we can find more diverse audience than in\u00a0the Science Museum.\u00a0We believe our works affect people on different levels. The first, entertaining one is addressed to all; but if you like to reflect a bit on the state of the world today \u2013 we offer this option too!", "Can you say something more about your appropriation of the language of corporate social responsibility in the work, or why it became important subject matter for you? It\u2019s not immediately the most obvious bedfellow for works which play so expertly with the outputs and aesthetics of mass media. But when one starts to think about the corporate world as a major driving force within new media and communication spaces, lots of questions start to arise. Is this in any way related to the political drivers that originally led you to practice as a net artist?", "Perhaps. You know, you start being an artist because you feel the world around you is unbearable, you don\u2019t see how you can participate in this circus. Then, you discover that art world is not any better, and you start looking for new frontiers. In the 90\u2019s the internet was such a frontier; then after few years it has become a part of a banal and rude reality. I think it\u2019s a kind of evil loop: you look for a new \u201ctemporary autonomous zone\u201d to quote Hakim Bey , and you start exploring it and then, after a while and thanks to your efforts\u00a0 it becomes eaten up by progressing capitalism.", "When working on our electronic gadgets/art objects we have discovered that our production is quite similar to that of a \u201creal\u201d electronics\u00a0company: same kind of chipboards, plastic, cameras. We work with contractors, we hire engineers and workers, we use a chinese labour force. We work on the market, we try to be innovative and offer new exciting products\u2026 Another world, our art production looks exactly like any other creative capitalist production. That\u2019s why we decided to go further and use the current corporate marketing strategies such as declaring social responsibility and sustainability. And it all is true \u2013 we do care about world around us and we do try to make it better!", "Your position also fluctuates quite irreverently between being sharply anticapitalist and a full-on creative entrepreneur luxuriating in the benefits of capitalism.

Being anti-capitalist is a luxury, it\u2019s a privilege of a first world citizen. You don\u2019t see any \u201cOccupy \u2026\u201d movements outside the Golden Billion countries. By sharpening the contradiction you are mentioning we want to emphasize the situation where critique of capitalism is in fact an essential part of the capitalist itself.", "How do you think your takes on corporate marketing speak actually critique rather than reiterate the ideologies you\u2019re commenting on?", "We think we do both. By our creative critique we point out the weak points of capitalism and offer patches for them. We believe that contemporary art, along with science, is an avant-garde institute of a capitalist society. And one of its most important missions is developing new aesthetics and communications techniques for future use in product design, advertising and politics. Look globally \u2013 what is called \u2018contemporary art\u2019 flourishes in the societies with innovative capitalism, and is rather marginal and derivative in the others.", "Many of the works in the exhibition either respond to, reflect or re-version viewers in real-time. How do the works create individualised experience for each audience member and how is it that these are a reflection of the audience themselves?", "Well the initial reason for us to start making works like that was our desire to please the viewers, everybody just loves to appear in an art work. Such a \u2018populist\u2019 approach was our deliberate choice when we were starting. Also, placing an audience in an artwork makes communication between the two much easier. Today, media personalities and celebrities appearing on screen are very popular and attractive social figures, so we are playing with people\u2019s desire to be one of them too.

Soldiers from all corners of the globe fought in battles that spanned the entire world, spreading the germs they picked up along the way. Those who survived the war went home in 1918, taking the influenza virus with them to their friends and family.", "As quickly as it appeared, the Spanish flu epidemic died out. It was suggested that its spread was controlled by quarantining patients, but it is more likely that this strain of influenza changed to become less severe.", "Though this sounds unusual, it is not that uncommon. Many strains of influenza become weaker as time goes on because stronger strains kill their hosts too quickly, limiting the time the virus has to spread and infect others.", "There were very few treatment options for patients with Spanish flu in 1918. Most medicines were aimed at making the patient as comfortable as possible by reducing fevers and alleviating pain.

Those who could get their head round it, however, knew that if his ideas were correct, a massive body like the Sun would bend any light passing near it. A way to test this would be to photograph the stars around the Sun during an eclipse and then photograph them again when the Sun was further away from them. Comparing the images would allow you to measure any displacement in the stars\u2019 apparent positions.", "According to Einstein\u2019s theories, the change should be 1.75 arcseconds, twice the value predicted by Newtonian physics. To put that figure in context, it\u2019s like trying to measure the width of a penny from a mile away. But that was exactly what two teams of British astronomers hoped to do in 1919. To add to the challenge, they had to transport their equipment to Sobral in northern Brazil, and the island of Pr\u00edncipe, off the west coast of Africa.", "One of the architects of the plan was Arthur Stanley Eddington , professor of astronomy at Cambridge and an active promoter of Einstein\u2019s theories (he was one of the few people who understood them). As a Quaker and pacifist, he also welcomed the opportunity to promote international cooperation after global war. Eddington went to Pr\u00edncipe with clockmaker Edwin Cottingham, while Charles Davidson and Andrew Crommelin of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich , went to Brazil.", "Each team took a large telescope, used to capture the image fed into it from a coelostat, a clockwork-driven mirror that counteracted Earth\u2019s rotation during long exposures of up to half a minute. The Sobral team also took a second, smaller telescope as backup.", "Transporting the delicate equipment was understandably daunting in a world still under wartime restrictions. Helped by colleagues in Portugal and Brazil, the teams arrived at their observing sites well ahead of the eclipse, giving them time to rehearse for the five minutes of totality and overcome any problems. Eddington worried about cloud, rain and mischievous monkeys on Pr\u00edncipe. Strong winds damaged the observing hut at Sobral, but rain washed away the dust clogging the coelostats. The heat made the photographic plates unstable, so developing had to be done at night.", "Despite the careful preparations, the day of the eclipse was tense as cloud threatened to ruin the observations on both sides of the Atlantic. Eddington saw little of the eclipse itself and was \u2018conscious only of the weird half-light of the landscape and the hush of nature, broken by the calls of the observers, and the beat of the metronome ticking out the 302 seconds of totality\u2019.", "The two teams took over 40 photographs, but concerns mounted as they began developing images. Clouds had obscured the stars on many of the Pr\u00edncipe images; only two could be used for the crucial measurements. The photographs from the larger Sobral telescope were no better: the coelostat mirror had distorted in the hot sun. Luckily, the smaller telescope\u2019s images looked promising. But comparison photographs still had to be taken, followed weeks of painstaking measurement and calculation.", "It was only in November 1919 that the results were announced at a meeting in London. When they were, it was the photographs from the smaller telescope at Sobral that proved decisive and were then distributed to astronomers worldwide. Some recent authors have suggested that there was a bit of cherry-picking here since the figures from the larger Sobral telescope\u2019s images were closer to the Newtonian value. But it is clear from the careful preparations at Sobral and on Pr\u00edncipe that the astronomers understood how their instruments had performed and how far they could trust the results from each.

The country must also continue to improve flood resilience: in the past 10 months, 8000 properties in England and Wales flooded but 200,000 were protected by defences built over the prior 30 years.", "Finally, he said that the nation needs to get more adept at planning for uncertainty.", "Chaired by Ian Blatchford, Director of the Science Museum, five key themes emerged from the round table discussion:", "1) Our relationship with water has altered. Long term environmental trends that result from climate change mean that although average annual rainfall is roughly the same, the intensity and variability have increased. There are other pressures on the water supply, caused by the continued reliance on Victorian sewers, demographic trends and the resulting impact of construction, such as covering tracts of land with paving.", "2) Science is critical. We require cutting edge science to understand issues ranging from climate change to the behaviour of surface water, which recently leapfrogged rivers as the primary flooding threat, when most warning systems are calibrated by river behaviour. However, much of this science is hedged in uncertainties \u2013 such as the limitations of medium range forecasting \u2013 and there are huge challenges in conveying them to the public.", "3) Collaboration. To deal with the change in Britain\u2019s water, collaborations need to come in different domains: between industry and universities in centres of excellence; multi-agency partnerships of the kind already working successfully between the Environment Agency and Met Office in flood warning; and between the water industry and local communities and councils on local solutions, such as reliance on wetland areas to absorb floodwaters. This relationship has to be a partnership, not paternalistic. These collaborations will not always need to bring about innovation but simply bring things together better. There are also issues finding funding support for applied science. Research councils tend to focus on strategic science and water companies tend to focus on practical research. Examples of collaborations between water industry leaders and universities are emerging, though more are desirable. The UK could also learn from the experience of countries such as Australia, where there is expertise in drought management.", "4) Communication. Water is crucial for existence and yet, paradoxically, the consumer needs a better understanding of the role it plays in everyday life, through a more obvious link between the cost, value and uses of water. One challenge is encouraging a community take action in advance of a drought, in preemptive measures that can delay the need for draconian measures, rather than in reactive measures when supplies run short. There are technologies, such as telemetry, which can provide more rapid warning to communities of flood risks, and smart meters, which are more engaging. Another communication issue is to both understand the way consumers respond, whether to warnings or tariffs, and to find the best way for institutions to earn their trust. Finally, the UK is a world leader in many areas and, rather than continuing to do brilliant work modestly, it should be bolder in conveying its successes to the public and globally, since water resources are a planetary issue.", "5) Skills. Understanding of the behaviour of local water has moved away from local authorities and, as emphasised in point 3) this has to be re-established in new collaborations, which are more focused on catchment areas than political boundaries. Another issue is maintaining the experience of \u2018flood veterans\u2019 who have dealt with earlier emergencies, such as the 2007 floods that triggered Sir Michael Pitt\u2019s review.", "Roger Highfield is the Director of External Affairs at the Science Museum Group."]},

A portable handheld telephone.\u201d", "These words, spoken by Martin Cooper \u2013 a senior engineer at Motorola, to Joel Engel \u2013 a competing developer at the company Bell Labs, began the first ever conversation to be had on a mobile telephone.", "It was 40 years ago that Martin Cooper, who has since become known as the father of the mobile telephone, made that call on a Motorola DynaTAC \u2013 a device 9 inches tall, 5 inches deep and weighing 28 ounces \u2013 truly a \u2018brick\u2019. However, it was still not until what has become known as the \u2018digital decade\u2019 between 1993 and 2003 that the mobile phones really took off commercially.", "Since then the mobile phone has advanced significantly \u2013 not least of all in size and design. Using mobile telephones as a means of calling your friends seems to have become inconsequential with the use of mobile internet, maps, text messaging, music and access to various other applications on-the-go. Which leaves me wondering \u2013 where next? How can mobile phone technology developer even further in the next forty years?", "Several communication companies, such as Telstra are currently trialling the use of mobile phones alongside health monitors, for example heart rate monitors attached discreetly to elderly patients, to transmit real-time health data to your GP enabling them to respond quickly to any abnormal activity. This technology would also have the potential to screen for major illness every time it takes a reading. Can you imagine how many lives could be saved rather than waiting five years between health screenings? Not to mention the time and money saved from reduced face-to-face check-ups and appointments.", "But let\u2019s take a step back for a moment \u2013 is this all good news? Mobile phone companies already have access to a lot of your personal information \u2013 most call and text message records are retained for at least a year and GPS services allow mobile networks to trace where your phone is used. Do you want mobile phone companies to have access to our health data too? Or do you think the potential health benefits outweigh the possible privacy risks?", "With so much progress being made since that first telephone call in 1973, the future of mobile phone technology seems limitless. What do you think the future holds?"]},

As a child, he had been gripped by Marooned , a 1969 American film directed by John Sturges and starring Gregory Peck, Richard Crenna, David Janssen, James Franciscus, and Gene Hackman about three astronauts who become stranded in space and subsequent rescue by the Soviets. \u2018It was very well researched and they really took seriously the realistic approach\u2026it is a blast.\u2019", "The relentless daisy-chain of action in Gravity was inspired by another script \u2013 Desierto \u2013 written by\u00a0Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s son and fellow scriptwriter Jon\u00e1s , which will be released as a film this year.", "The first draft of their script only had one character, Dr. Stone. The father and son team wanted to make her journey during this chain reaction of challenges \u2018work metaphorically\u2019, focusing on the idea of her rebirth in the hostile environment of space.", "Earlier that night I took Cuar\u00f3n around the Cosmonauts exhibition and he pointed out how the astronauts sit in custom-moulded seats to adopt the fetal position within a descent module such as a Soyuz , which can be regarded like a womb, while spacewalkers were tethered by a glorified umbilical cord as they floated in the void.", "But relying on a single lead character \u2018proved to be a bit self-conscious\u2019, contrived, even tedious, he admitted. That is when he and his son started to develop the role of a companion, the veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski, played by George Clooney .", "The audience was held rapt by the four clips introduced by Samira Ahmed, starting with an accident with a Russian satellite that triggers the Kessler syndrome , named after Donald Kessler, formerly at Nasa\u2019s Johnson Space Center in Houston. With a colleague, Kessler proposed that collisions between man-made objects in orbit could spawn swarms of junk, sparking a chain reaction that would swiftly ring the Earth with the debris from thousands of satellites. It is already \u2018full of trash up there,\u2019 said Cuar\u00f3n.", "Even though \u2018the whole story is quite impossible (we\u2019re not stupid)\u2019 he told the audience, he said he still wanted it to feel authentic, based on circumstances faced in real space exploration. He spent time talking to Nasa. \u2018I asked astronauts what can go wrong. They said: \u2018everything\u2019\u2019.", "Although some carped about details in the film, the Apollo 13 commander Jim Lovell told me that Gravity is \u201ca marvellous creation of cinematography\u201d. And Cuar\u00f3n was careful to explain that sometimes, paradoxically, the real thing looked too unreal for Hollywood. In the case of the spacesuits , for example, they chose an older \u2018last season\u2019 design because the latest versions looked too \u2018science fiction.\u2019", "Kowalski also gossiped much more than real-life astronauts to contrast with Bullock\u2019s \u2018shut up\u2019 character. He added that he felt obliged to let George natter because \u2018he\u2019s so charming.\u2019", "In making the film, Cuar\u00f3n had to overcome many technical challenges. Only at the last moment did he tell Bullock, who was not keen on flying, that she did not have to film in a so-called \u2018vomit comet\u2019 (a specially fitted plane that climbs and dips to simulate weightlessness, often with unfortunate effects). In this way, he hoped that she would be more receptive to endure the pain of being suspended on 12 wires like a glorified marionette to simulate microgravity. It was like something out of \u2019Fifty Shades of Grey\u2019 he joked.", "Bullock had to work out for four months and practiced with professional puppeteers, from the play War Horse, to be fit enough to film the fire sequence scene. \u2018Took us forever to figure out how to do it,\u2019 explained Cuar\u00f3n, explaining that it took robots, a specially built rig and simulating the complex movements of belts and tethers. The end result shows her floating and twirling through the space station during the sequence, filmed in a single fluid shot.", "Not all effects were high tech. For the final, lengthy re-entry sequence, Bullock was jolted and shaken around in a capsule that sat atop of pneumatic tyres as the film crew jumped up and down. In this way, the movie recreated her thundering passage through the atmosphere back to Earth, which Cuar\u00f3n likened to riding a \u2018rodeo bull\u2019. To help build the emotional climax of Gravity, he added music, sans percussion.", "He also admitted to Samira Ahmed that the movie cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki was \u2018so upset with me\u2019 when he edited out his favourite moment. On the cutting room floor lies a scene in which Kowalski and Stone see a Soyuz approaching them and think, wrongly, that it was a rescue mission. As they gazed at each other \u2018helmet to helmet\u2019 bathed in sunlight, they \u2018lose it for a moment\u2019. \u2018It was a good scene, I love it,\u2019 said Cuaron. But to maintain the emotional momentum, and prevent the movie from becoming repetitive, it had to go.", "The stunning cinematography was brought to life with the help of British visual effects company\u00a0Framestore, and was informed by discussions with scientists, for instance about how flames appear in space (spherical and \u2018quite beautiful,\u2019 he said) and earlier real-life incidents, notably on the Mir space station. Bullock would even ring up Nasa astronaut Catherine Coleman as she orbited in the International Space Station for advice and insights.", "The studio attempted to persuade Cuar\u00f3n to end Gravity with a dramatic helicopter rescue of Bullock\u2019s character, or even with Dr. Stone rekindling love interest with an individual in mission control. He rejected the overblown and cheesy in favour of a simple shot of \u2018a little house in the distance.\u2019", "The event was the latest in a series to celebrate Cosmonauts , the most significant exhibition of Soviet and Russian space artefacts ever staged outside Russia. Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n told the IMAX audience the exhibition is \u2018amazing\u2026the Soviet space programme has been very, very underrated. It is so great that it is finally celebrated.\u2019", "As he left the auditorium, the audience watched a video of the cosmonaut who deserves to be the original inspiration for Dr Stone: the great Valentina Tereshkova . Tereshkova was the first woman in space, the first civilian and remains the only woman to have flown solo in space.", "Roger Highfield is Director of External Affairs at the Science Museum."]},

Each side had to learn about the other\u2019s spacecraft; how Soyuz and Apollo worked, how they could be joined together in space and what new techniques and systems would need to be developed to do this. And there was the language problem; how to accommodate two teams that spoke different languages. In the early days it had not been easy:", "American Translator: Good evening! Soviet Party: Hello!

Stafford, veteran commander of the Apollo 10 mission around the Moon, put his newly acquired command of Russian to good use one July 4 evening at the cosmonaut training facility near Moscow. He and his astronaut colleagues had been letting off fireworks and crackers that \u201csounded like a machine gun\u201d. To a suspicious policeman that approached he said \u201cDobryy vecher. Kak dela? Eto den?\u2019 Nashey revolyutsii!\u201d (Good evening. How are you? It is the day of our revolution!).", "Leonov and Stafford\u2019s handshake in orbit was transmitted around the world \u2013 the first time that Soviet citizens had seen live TV pictures of cosmonauts in space. Previous Soviet space missions had been reported mostly by radio and the newspapers \u2013 and then only once successfully underway or completed, or stitched together into films shown later at the cinema. While Soviet and American engineers and managers laboured over the technologies of joining two spacecraft in orbit the respective media teams had had to conduct long and protracted negotiations to ensure each side reported the mission to their own satisfaction.", "Forty years on it may seem as though Apollo-Soyuz has become a footnote in space history, a one-off event that struggles against the dazzling space race of the 1960s. And yet, the mission demonstrated that two fundamentally different cultures could work together through a common language of space exploration. Twenty years later the US Space Shuttle docked for the first time with the Soviet\u2019s Mir space station. And today the International Space Station continues to host astronauts and cosmonauts from around the world. The vital agreement between the Russian and US space agencies for its operation has now been extended to run until 2024 , despite political differences between the two nations.", "Alexei Leonov recently visited the Science Museum as part of the launching ceremony for Cosmonauts: Birth of the Space Age .

But this fascinating object can teach a lot about how scientific knowledge was developed and spread in the 1600s.", "This object was very likely made in Augsburg , a city in modern-day Germany, which was Europe\u2019s unofficial home for luxury furniture making in the 1600s. Craftsmen (unfortunately they were all men as far as we know) from Augsburg made elaborate items like cabinets, boxes, and writing desks for aristocratic customers.", "In a time before trains or motor vehicles, it may seem curious that a small landlocked city in Germany became a manufacturing hub for goods crafted from imported materials.", "But Augsburg was home to wealthy families who got into the business of overseas trade when shipping to Asia and South America became more affordable in the 16 th century.", "One of the most notorious Augsburg merchants was Konrad Rott, who held monopoly contracts on certain goods imported from Asia, most notably pepper.", "Like other Augsburg merchants, he imported goods via Portugal, and half of everything he imported was given to the Portuguese crown in exchange for their cooperation.", "When he ultimately went bankrupt due to a fluctuation in pepper prices that his business could not withstand, Rott faked his own death and fled Augsburg to live under a different name in Portugal.", "All of the imported materials that make up this object \u2013 ivory, ebony, and rosewood \u2013 would have been imported by merchants like Rott.", "The novelty of materials shipped from far-away places and their relative scarcity in Europe made these imports extremely expensive at the time when this box was made.", "Ivory has often been called \u201cwhite gold\u201d and used to be purchased by the ounce like silver or gold.", "Ebony wood, used in the parquetry patterns on the inside of the box\u2019s lids, was so expensive in Europe in the 1600s that it was sometimes imitated with dyed, blackened pear wood to fool buyers.", "Rosewood, also used in the parquetry interior, was not commonly imported from South America to Europe until the 17th century. Rosewood can be distilled into oil, and in this form it is a popular scent used in cosmetics.", "High demand for rosewood in the 1900s eventually led to global scarcity. International law now prevents the growth of the rosewood market and restricts rosewood trade.", "The explosion of imports of expensive materials like rosewood and ebony at the time when this box was created corresponded with significant improvements in trade infrastructure. The expansion of European trade networks also corresponded with an increased ability to gain and share knowledge about other parts of the world.", "This box was made in Europe, yet some of the plants and animals painted on its exterior would have never been seen alive in Europe at the time. Assuming that whoever painted this box was European, they would have had to reference the drawings and paintings that others had made of these animals.", "In the late 1500s, printed botanical and zoological books with drawings or woodcuts of animals were gaining popularity, but they were still expensive, and only owned by the wealthy or well-connected.", "The most famous of these books was a series of six volumes by the Swiss physician Conrad Gessner, who published his Historia Animalium between 1551 and 1558.", "Gessner was the first European to describe and depict many plants and animals originating outside of Europe , including the tulip and the bird of paradise.", "As soon as one artist created an image of a previously unseen animal , others would copy it into their own books and artwork.", "This reliance on other artists\u2019 images in order to depict animals which many people had never actually seen in person meant the perpetuation of many mistakes in how these animals or plants were pictured.", "Gessner\u2019s well-known and widely copied drawing of bird of paradise was based on a dead specimen that had been shipped to Europe from its native New Guinea. Birds of paradise often had their limbs removed in local rituals and for preservation as specimens before they were transported to Europe.", "As a consequence, Gessner\u2019s drawing (which was widely published as a print in his book), was of a bird lacking wings or legs \u2013 as were the drawings by many European artists who came after him.", "It was said at the time that these birds must have floated magically in the breeze, only landing when they died, which explained why the skins didn\u2019t appear to have wings or legs. But in reality, the lack of limbs in many drawings may have simply stemmed from the fact that the artists didn\u2019t know what the limbs would have looked like on a live bird.", "Systematic mistakes were also made in flower drawings in the 16 th and 17 th centuries. It was thought at the time that the purpose of flowers was to protect the developing fruit. So, the reproductive organs of flowers were occasionally mis-drawn or omitted, even though we now know that these are the very reason for flowers\u2019 existence. Some of the lilies on this box are painted with visible stamens and pistils, but others are painted without these critical pollen-and ovule-producing features.", "Of course, it is not unusual for artists to make art that is not meant to perfectly mirror nature. But these errors are particularly interesting because the artists who created paintings of plants and animals at the time were also some of the first botanists and zoologists.", "By systematically indexing and classifying a wide variety of organisms, comparing them, and documenting their characteristics in their books of drawings or paintings, these artists created a new field of scientific inquiry.", "At the time, these makers of books about plants and animals were creating and sharing new knowledge\u2014but there was no need to define that knowledge as a discipline, to categorize it as an art or a science, nor to classify the people involved as artists or botanists or zoologists.", "Unfortunately, even a wealth of knowledge about the societal and scientific context in which this object was created does not solve the mystery of how, and why, this box came to be.", "There are two crests on the top of the box, which are likely the crests of the former owners, but these have been attributed to multiple possible families over time.", "The presence of two coats of arms means that it may have been made to celebrate a marriage. The current attribution of one of the crests is to the Dukes of Pommern-Stettin, or Pomerania (which is in modern-day Northern Germany and Poland), and the other is that of the Schleswig-Holstein family.", "But there were multiples marriages between these families in the 1600s, so it is difficult to say who it belonged to. And as the owners are unknown , so too are the makers. To add to the mystery, the double-lidded design and decision to paint the box are not terribly common, so what the box was made for is also uncertain.", "Curiously, this box documents a variety of knowledge that Europeans held about the wider world in the 1600s when it was created. Yet, this fascinating object will not yield its own secrets easily.", "The Courtauld Gallery \u2019s painted ivory marriage casket is on display at the Science Museum (on Level 2) until early 2020 as part of the Illuminating Objects project.

From today, there\u2019s a small display on the transit at the rear of our Exploring Space gallery, featuring one of the astronomical quadrants made for the Royal Society\u2019s 1769 expeditions.

We do know that one of the clocks made for timing the transits, now on display in our Making the Modern World gallery, accompanied Cook on his third South Sea voyage in 1776.", "Although less celebrated today, the two 19th century transits (1874 and 1882) also saw major expeditions , and were widely reported in the public sphere.

With this in mind, Boghosian, Coveney and Wang investigated the implications of the limited range of numbers used by digital computers.", "First, digital computers only use a subset of the rational numbers, when there are infinitely more so-called irrational numbers.", "Secondly, digital computers handle four billion rational numbers that range from plus to minus infinity, the so-called \u2018single-precision IEEE floating-point numbers\u2019, which refers to a technical standard for floating-point arithmetic established by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in the 1950s.", "Moreover, these four billion numbers are exponentially distributed as decreasing powers of 2, so there are as many between 0.125 and 0.25, as there are between 0.25 and 0.5, as there are between 0.5 and 1. \u2018It\u2019s incredible that these floating-point numbers are capable of capturing as much of reality as they do since they are highly non-uniformly distributed,\u2019 says Prof Coveney.", "The richness of the real world is entrained with irrational numbers which cannot be represented on any digital computer (\u2018and will not be representable on a quantum computer either\u2019, he adds).\u00a0\u2018For Lorenz, it was a very small change in the last few decimal places in the numbers used to start a simulation that caused his diverging results,\u2019 he says. \u2018What neither he nor others realised, and is highlighted in our new work, is that any such finite (rational) initial condition describes a behaviour which may be statistically highly unrepresentative\u2019.", "To investigate, Prof Coveney and his colleagues used a simple mathematical recipe for chaos, called the generalised Bernoulli map, where real numbers between zero and 1 are multiplied repeatedly by a constant number greater than one at each iteration, with the catch that if they exceed the value of 1, the remainder (modulo 1) is used in the next iteration.", "Apparently random locations crop up between 0 and 1, despite the simplicity of the recipe, which is the hallmark of chaos.

These genetic quirks, sometimes interpreted as clever adaptations to better cope with other environmental or medical conditions, have meant that strictly medical approaches to research and treatment have sometimes been complicated by cultural and societal issues.", "Genetic superpower?", "One theory that has developed to explain the high prevalence of thalassemias in people with Southern European, Middle Eastern and South Asian descent is that (once again similarly to sickle-cell) the mutation that causes thalassemia is thought to offer a degree of protection against malaria. This adaptation could account for the ability of people to survive in historically malaria-ridden environments, where others would not be able to cope.

Their aim is to raise awareness and engagement with specific inequalities and issues faced by those living with the condition and their families.", "Both these activist groups have had close ties and worked together, partly due to the similarities between Sickle Cell and Thalassemia, but also due to the specific challenges of cutting through prejudice that exists even in a discipline that should not discriminate. In 2013, following the death of Sickle-Cell patient Sarah Mulenga, chief executive of the Sickle-Cell Society John James spoke out about pervasive stereotypes , lack of public education and how they combine to leave medical professionals ill-equipped to treat patients who are in crisis.

This shocking lack of awareness, in part due to public health messaging about the condition being neglected at a national level, led to the creation of publications specifically aimed at the British-Asian community that drew on community networks and narratives to get the message across.", "The NHS has also taken on board the urgency of building trust with marginalised communities, with specific campaigns designed to encourage BAME communities to donate blood .", "In the Science Museum\u2019s new Medicine Galleries , a display features a molecular model of a red blood cell showing abnormalities associated with Sickle Cell.

This made it even more important for me and my team to provide professional photographs of the painting, especially as it had not been seen by the public for more than thirty years.", "To add another layer of complexity to our task we knew we needed to try and produce a replication that was high-resolution enough to do the painting justice and allow viewers to zoom in and explore Cuneo\u2019s work in as much detail as possible.", "As no conventional camera could provide the resolution we were after it was clear that the only way to achieve this was by photographing the painting in sections and then combining all the individual files into one final image.", "There are two different methods to carry out this kind of photography. The first one is to keep the camera chip parallel to the painting\u2019s surface at all times and move the camera from side to side and up and down keeping the same distance between painting and camera.", "This is best achieved using a specialist rigging system as this method allows for very little margin for error. On the plus side it minimises image distortion and a fall-off in sharpness at the edges delivering a high-quality result.", "The second method is to keep the camera in a fixed position in front of the painting. Then while remaining in this position at all times the camera is tilted and swivelled at different angles to capture the different sections.", "After careful consideration of resources and pros and cons of both methods we opted for the second option. Our colleagues in the conservation department were a great help, facilitating access to the painting and operating the narrow aisle truck. We only had a day to complete our task and needed to get going as soon as possible.", "With one photographer on the ground and one photographer moving upwards in the truck\u2019s cabin we started with a reference image capturing the painting in a single photograph.", "For this we needed to find a position that allowed us to have the camera as central to the middle of the painting and as far away from it as possible in order to minimise vertical and lateral lens distortion.", "Luckily the storage shelves split right in front of the painting and the space was wide enough to allow us to drive back into the aisle giving us a prime focal length.", "Once we had found the correct position and height we experimented with different exposures and most importantly made sure we had the correct white balance setting.", "When we had meticulously prepared our shot it was time to raise the stakes and start photographing the painting in several sections.", "We started with only six sections and an overlap of 50%. To make sure each image would align correctly, and to identify any issues the photographer on the ground started to post-produce the images straight away to allow us to adjust our capturing method if necessary.", "For the final file we captured 36 images and carefully put them through post-production making sure we were staying as true to the reference image as possible.", "The results exceeded our expectations as the largest stitched photograph was more than 14 times larger than the reference image thus allowing the viewer to experience Terence Cuneo\u2019s painting in as much rich detail as possible.", "Take a look at the final image on our collections page here .", ""]},

Embryos are implanted in the mother on day six, but it had not been possible to study this process, the \u2018black box of development,\u2019 until the Cambridge team found the right conditions.", "However, their feat has also triggered intense debate because international guidelines and UK legislation forbid human embryos being grown beyond 14 days, based on the fact that only at this point in development does the embryo have a glimmer of a body axis. This is also the latest stage at which the embryo can split to form twins.", "The Cambridge work promises to provide vivid new insights into the details of human development. Among them, Dr Shahbazi reflected on how human embryos appear to have an \u2018intrinsic capability\u2019 for self-organisation, at least until day 13, without the help of the mother. Using their new methods, they could also open the black box of development, revealing processes during the all-important stage of implantation. \u2018Around 30 to 70 per cent of pregnancies fail at implantation,\u2019 she said.", "Using brightly-coloured fluorescent labels, the Cambridge team can chart the details of the breath-taking feats of self-organization that lie behind the development of a single fertilized egg into that vast, sentient community of interacting and different cells that we call a human being.", "Moving closer to the clinic, Dr Fogarty presented pioneering gene editing research performed at the Francis Crick Institute in London. She and her colleagues are using genetic surgery (genome editing, with the formal title CRISPR/Cas9) to turn off genes in human development to study molecular mechanisms of development before implantation. \u2018Before we had done this study, we did not know if this technique would work in the human embryo,\u2019 she said.", "Her team at the Crick studied the development in a plastic dish of an edited human embryo, which had been donated by parents undergoing IVF, with their informed consent.", "Genes are the recipes to make the body\u2019s building blocks, proteins, and her lab focused on one particular protein, OCT4, which they revealed was at work in the embryo\u2019s cells by using a chemical label that glowed green.", "Using gene editing, they turned off OCT4 and compared the consequences with an unedited control embryo in time-lapse videos. Both embryos cleaved as they developed but when it came to the formation of a cavity, when the embryo is at the stage of implantation and called a blastocyst, the edited embryos were unstable and collapsed.", "Without OCT4 the embryos were \u2018messed up\u2019, said Dr Fogarty, and did not make the right proteins in the right cell types, particularly in the 20 or so of the 200 cells in the early embryo that go on to form the baby (the rest form the placenta). The conclusion, she said, was that OCT4 is fundamental to the proper development of human blastocysts. This proof of principle experiment is a small but important step in beginning to understand what genes are absolutely required for embryo development.", "The profound impact of these technologies on parents became clear when Professor Turnbull described his efforts in Newcastle over more than a decade to offer a treatment to families who are blighted by disorders in mitochondria \u2013 the cell\u2019s power packs (around one in 5000 of the population).", "His team has developed a way to have unaffected children by the creation of what are called \u2018three parent babies\u2019, with a second \u2018mother\u2019 providing normal mitochondria. Their proposal was radical because scientists have agonised for decades over what is called \u201cgerm-line\u201d gene therapy \u2013 genetic changes passed down in eggs and sperm. However, what the Newcastle team proposed was not like conventional germ-line therapy, since it would only affect future generations if used to free a baby girl of the disease (mitochondria are only passed from mother to child.)", "After a long and exhaustive period of consultation, the Newcastle Fertility Centre was granted the first UK licence in March of this year \u2013 in fact first of its kind anywhere \u2013 to offer mitochondrial donation by pronuclear transfer, a way to take the parent\u2019s DNA and combine it with mitochondria from an egg donor.", "\u2018We probably have the best regulation anywhere in the world\u2019, he said, referring to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act. When a child is eventually born with another woman\u2019s mitochondria, which is likely in the next year or two, their long-term development will be monitored in what is not an IVF technique but \u2018a pathway of care\u2019.", "After each of the presentations we discussed a wide range of issues with each other and the audience, from larger questions of when personhood begins to the development of artificial embryos , referring to remarkable research by Prof Zernicka-Goetz in Cambridge which has yielded the first artificial mouse embryos, created without the need for eggs or sperm.", "All agreed that the legacy of Louise Brown\u2019s birth is immense, from the boost that the pioneering work by Patrick Steptoe and, in particular, Robert Edwards, gave to basic reproductive science, prompting the introduction of a robust way to regulate these technologies (however, though the speakers agreed with the need for regulation, they also agreed there\u2019s too much red tape).", "In the wake of the birth of Louise Brown, scientists have revealed new details of human development, and why it goes awry, for instance in miscarriage and this research continues to give hope to vast numbers of couples who are unable to have a child.", "You can listen to the conversion full here:"]},

The romance of this mathematical story, \u2018captivated me\u2019, he said. \u2018Fermat wrote down this problem in a copy of a book of Greek mathematics. It was only found after his death by his son.\u2019", "Last year, in recognition of his towering achievement, Sir Andrew was awarded the Abel Prize, the mathematics\u2019 equivalent of the Nobel Prize, and today the Royal Society Research Professor of Mathematics at Oxford\u2019s Mathematical Institute continues to explore new horizons in mathematics that have been opened up by his work on Fermat.", "After a brief lecture, Sir Andrew was joined by mathematician and broadcaster Dr Hannah Fry of University College London, a familiar face in the Science Museum, having this year presented Britain\u2019s Greatest Invention from the museum\u2019s storage facility near Swindon, and been one of the faces associated with the museum\u2019s Tomorrow\u2019s World partnership with the BBC, Royal Society, Open University and Wellcome.", "Despite his years of struggle, and the scepticism of his peers, did he always believe it was possible to prove Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem? \u2018Oh yes,\u2019 said Sir Andrew. \u201cI am always quite encouraged when people say something like: \u201cYou can\u2019t do it that way.\u201d\u2019", "Did Fermat himself really have a proof? Based on the mathematics of his day, \u2018the probability is almost zero,\u2019 though he added: \u2018it is just conceivable.\u2019", "Sir Andrew realised early on in his attempt on the problem that conventional mathematical approaches had been exhausted but became intrigued once again in 1986 when he realised a new route to crack the problem had opened up in mainstream mathematics, through the study of what are called elliptic curves.", "During years of intense study, he placed his faith in the \u2018three Bs\u2019: Bus, bath and bed. In other words, the power of the subconscious, when his mind could relax and was given rein to wander. Sir Andrew is a specialist in number theory, a branch of mathematics dedicated to the study of integers. So, asked Dr Fry, are there other areas of pure mathematics that he wished he had more time to study? \u2018I confess that I was addicted to number theory from the time I was ten years old,\u2019 he said.\u2019 I have never found anything else in mathematics that appealed quite as much.\u2019", "Dr Fry pointed out that the implication was, of course, that there were other fields of undergraduate mathematics where the Abel prize winner felt he was weaker. \u2018Definitely true\u2019, he said.", "Even so, he found a way to sate his addiction as a student. \u2018There was not much number theory in undergraduate mathematics\u2019 so he would \u2018sneak off to the library to try and read Fermat. \u2018But Fermat had this really irritating habit of writing in Latin,\u2019 said Sir Andrew. Even today, his grasp of Latin remains \u2018minimal\u2019.", "Terms such as \u2018elegance\u2019 and \u2018beauty\u2019 are bandied around by many mathematicians. What do they mean? They are hard to explain but Sir Andrew likened the mathematical equivalent of experiencing the rapture of beauty to walking down a path to explore a garden by the great landscape architect Capability Brown, when a breathtaking vista suddenly beckons. In other words, elegance in mathematics \u2018is this surprise element of suddenly see everything clarified and beautiful.\u2019", "But you should \u2018not stare at it non-stop\u2019, he warned, else the majesty will fade, as is also the case with great paintings and music.", "Today he is still walking through the great garden of mathematics, \u2018the language of science,\u2019 he said. Another way Sir Andrew described his lifelong passion to the rapt audience was as a \u2018beautiful edifice\u2026the most permanent thing there is.\u2019", "Industry and government realise that mathematicians are the lifeblood of a modern economy but are concerned by the lack of uptake of maths. Most young people \u2018do have a real appetite for mathematics\u2019, said Sir Andrew, but they are put off because, he believes, their teachers are not viscerally interested in the subject.", "It is in primary schools that teachers need to kindle sparks of interest in the subject but many of them aren\u2019t actually mathematicians because so many maths graduates end up in better paid careers.", "Young people need to learn from someone who truly enjoys the subject, and shows their enjoyment, he said. When the teachers don\u2019t truly care about mathematics, \u2018that gets passed on.\u2019 One solution to attracting better teachers, he added, is to \u2018pay them more\u2019. His comment was greeted with warm applause.", "Is skill at mathematics more a matter of nature than nurture? Sir Andrew disagrees with the depiction of mathematicians in the movie Good Will Hunting, which suggests success means being born with an aptitude for mathematics so that \u2018it is easy.\u2019", "He told the audience that there are some things you are born with that might make it easier but, he stressed, \u2018it\u2019s never easy.\u2019", "\u2018Mathematicians struggle with mathematics even more than the general public does,\u2019 said Sir Andrew. \u2018We really struggle. It\u2019s hard.\u2019", "But, he added, \u2018we learn how to adapt to that struggle.\u2019 Intriguingly, he said that some young, bright PhD mathematicians might find it hard to adapt to a life with less instant gratification from solving problems, and \u2018can\u2019t cope with being stuck for more than 24 hours\u2019.", "To be a great research mathematician, it takes character more than just technical skill. \u2018You need a particular kind of personality that will struggle with things, will focus, won\u2019t give up.\u2019", "Paradoxically, he suggested that those who are not so good at mathematics are able to cope better with research and the frustration of being stuck.", "What is the next great challenge in mathematics? Sir Andrew referred to the Millennium Prize Problems, seven problems in mathematics that were highlighted by the Clay Mathematics Institute in 2000, each with a $1 million prize.", "One, the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture, was solved in 2003. The most famous of the remaining six, and the one that he would bet on to be cracked next, is the Riemann hypothesis, a great unsolved problem identified in 1900 by the highly influential German mathematician David Hilbert. \u2018It says something about the way prime numbers are distributed,\u2019 he said.", "He encouraged young mathematicians to attempt these \u2018impossible problems\u2019 while they are teens or undergraduates, to give them a taste for research, but to set them to one side when starting a career \u2018to be responsible.\u2019", "The special event was introduced by Martin Bridson, Whitehead Professor of Pure Mathematics, Head of the Mathematical Institute, and by Dame Mary Archer, Chair of the Science Museum Group, who listed various mathematics initiatives in the museum.", "Dame Mary pointed out that the museum\u2019s Wonderlab interactive gallery has launched a new mathematics show for young visitors, called Primetime, to celebrate the remarkable impact of mathematics on everyday life.", "Thanks to the help of Prof Marcus du Sautoy of Oxford, also one of the museum\u2019s advisors, the Bodleian commissioned a carbon dating project of the \u2018Bakhshali manuscript\u2019, part of which is on display in the museum, which revealed the first written record of zero, a highly-influential number, dates back four centuries further than most scholars had thought.", "Since it opened last December, Mathematics: the Winton Gallery , has welcomed 1.2 million visitors and won two awards. In the audience was David Harding, who with his wife Claudia donated \u00a35m to fund the gallery, designed by the late Dame Zaha Hadid, to inspire future generations of mathematicians.", "Also in the packed IMAX theatre was the TV presenter Dara O\u2019Briain, William Shawcross, Chairman of the Charity Commission for England and Wales, Ilyas Khan of Cambridge Quantum Computing, school teachers and many young mathematicians \u2013 perhaps even a future Abel prize-winner or Fields medalist.", ""]},

It was made in the early 1670s by none other than Sir Isaac Newton and used mirrors to gather light, rather than lenses as found in refracting telescopes. In fact, Newton is often credited with inventing the reflecting telescope \u2013 but it\u2019s worth remembering that contemporaries like James Gregory were experimenting with similar designs at this time.", "Newton\u2019s reflecting telescope mirrors were made from an alloy called speculum metal. Essentially a type of bronze, speculum metal has an unusually high tin content \u2013 typically about 30% \u2013 to give mirrors a suitably silvery, reflective surface.", "It was a notoriously difficult material for astronomers to work with , being both brittle and prone to tarnishing quickly. But despite the inconvenience of having to frequently remove and repolish the mirrors, speculum metal remained the material of choice for reflecting telescopes well into the 19 th century in the absence of suitable alternatives.", "Astronomers experimented with different recipes for speculum metal over the centuries, but the two main ingredients were copper and tin. Newton added small amounts of arsenic to his, arguing that it made the metal whiter and more reflective. He did at least take some basic precautionary measures when melting this poisonous substance to make his alloy, \u2018bewaring in the mean time, not to draw in breath near the pernicious fumes\u2019 ( Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society , vol. 7 (1672)).", "We had a go at making speculum metal telescope mirrors \u2013 arsenic NOT included \u2013 as part of a \u201chow-it\u2019s-made\u201d film for the Science City gallery. We wanted to showcase some of the extraordinary craft skills needed to produce many of the historical scientific instruments in our collection.", "Making a historically sympathetic telescope mirror involves two key processes: first, the metal is cast in the shape of a disc; then, the surface of the disc is ground and polished to a smooth, accurate mirror finish. Speculum metal is now virtually obsolete as a material, but thanks to the virtuoso skills and tireless efforts of some truly talented contemporary artists, we were able to meet this somewhat unpredictable challenge head-on.", "Artists Necole Schmitz , Stephen Coles and Katie Surridge took on the casting processes, melting the specially alloyed speculum metal in a chimney furnace at over 1000 degrees Celsius before pouring it into disc-shaped moulds.", "Speculum metal might look light and fluid when it\u2019s molten, but it\u2019s actually very heavy: our resulting mirror disc \u2013 a modest 6 inches in diameter \u2013 weighed about 4kg! Still, that\u2019s peanuts compared to the 6-foot speculum metal mirror from the Great Rosse Telescope in our collection, which weighs in at over 4 tonnes\u2026", "Our mirror was cast with an almost imperceptibly shallow concave face \u2013 only about a millimetre deep in the centre. But that gentle curve is vital; millions of wavelengths of light hitting the mirror from myriad angles are then all reflected back to converge perfectly at a single point, producing a focused, blur-free image.", "The mirror disc\u2019s concave surface then had to be ground against another metal disc with an equally matching convex surface. This grinds out imperfections from the casting process to make the mirror smoother and more reflective and helps to grind a more accurate curve into the mirror.", "Artist Terry Kubecki Pearce , an expert in hand-grinding telescope mirrors, was the man for the job. Nowadays telescope mirrors are made from glass which is ground into shape before receiving a reflective coating, but the hand-grinding techniques are similar to those that would have been used for speculum metal mirrors. In fact, metal mirror grinding itself developed out of the materials, tools and techniques used for grinding spectacle lenses and other forms of glass.", "Terry ground the mirror against the convex disc using ever finer pastes of water mixed with sand, from coarse, gritty grades right down to ground pumice stone as smooth as flour. He then polished it to a high shine on a bed of slightly softened set pitch, or tar, with polishing powder. This is exactly what earlier astronomers did: William Herschel ground his speculum metal mirrors with coarse emery and water; Newton polished his on a bed of pitch while John Hadley similarly used pitch-soaked silk.", "It may sound straightforward enough, but grinding and polishing a speculum metal mirror is not for the faint-hearted. Caroline Herschel , sister of William and herself an accomplished astronomer who went on to discover eight comets, wrote of her \u2018attendance on my Brother when polishing, that by way of keeping him alife I was even obliged to feed him by putting the Vitals by bits into his mouth \u2013 this was once the case when at the finishing of a 7 foot mirror, he had not left his hands from it for 16 hours together\u2019 (Michael Hoskin (ed.), Caroline Herschel\u2019s Autobiographies (Cambridge, 2003) p. 55).", "It took Terry over 20 hours of grinding and polishing to produce our mirror \u2013 and no, thankfully, he didn\u2019t do it non-stop!", "Our speculum metal mirror is about the same size as that for the reflecting telescope with which William Herschel discovered the planet Uranus in 1781 \u2013 the first planet to be discovered with a telescope.

Inventions such as curling tongs feel relatively modern but they have actually been around for centuries.", "We only have to look at paintings and carvings from the ancient world to see that having curls was a fashion that crossed many cultures. Babylonian and Assyrian men dyed their hair and square beards black, then crimped and curled them with basic curling irons. Persian and Greek nobles also used rods of iron or bronze heated over a fire to produce impressive hairstyles which would highlight their wealth and beauty. Egyptian nobles often cropped their hair close or shaved their heads but on ceremonial occasions, for protection from the sun, they wore wigs. The wigs would be long and full of curls or braids, which were styled with tools like this one.", "These bronze curling tongs are combined with a hair trimmer and would have been heated up on a fire before pieces of hair were curled around them.", "In the 1890s tonging became very popular as hair was elaborately styled on top of the head often with loose curls or ringlets around the face. Books and articles with instructions were written about the arrangement of hair to emphasise a woman\u2019s beauty, and upper-class women were expected to follow these guidelines.", "The fashion wasn\u2019t just for the very wealthy anymore though as the emerging middle-classes tried to emulate the style.

He is perhaps most widely known today for his wartime codebreaking exploits at Bletchley Park , where he devised processes and technologies to crack German \u2018 Enigma \u2019 messages on an industrial scale. The intelligence uncovered at Bletchley was central to Britain\u2019s war effort and may have shortened the conflict by up to two years. Winston Churchill described the site\u2019s cryptanalysts as his \u2018 golden geese that never cackled \u2019.", "Turing\u2019s first major contribution to science had been a paper written in 1936, when he was just 24, on an abstruse theoretical problem in the philosophy of mathematics. \u2018On computable numbers, with an application to the Entscheidungsproblem\u2019 attacked German mathematician David Hilbert\u2019s so-called \u2018decision problem\u2019, which sought a formal underpinning of mathematics. Turing\u2019s paper was a philosophical bombshell which destroyed the consistency of the subject.", "This work brought Turing to the attention of a small group of mathematicians and philosophers, but it was its theoretical description of a \u2018universal computing machine\u2019, capable of carrying out any computable task, which was later seen as the conceptual basis of today\u2019s stored-program computers. For Turing, his 1936 universal machines were simply thought experiments, but for others they signalled the future of computing. Turing himself wrote one of the first practical designs for a stored-program computer, later realised as the \u2018 Pilot ACE \u2019, on display in the exhibition.", "Alongside his work in cryptanalysis and computing, Turing is also widely remembered for his work on machine intelligence after he left wartime Bletchley Park. The \u2018 Turing test \u2019, sketched out in his seminal 1950 paper \u2018Computing machinery and intelligence\u2019, has become a popular trope in artificial intelligence. It was Turing\u2019s response to a philosophical stumbling block. First he asked, \u2018Can machines think?\u2019 He then proposed that this, itself, could never be known. Instead, if a machine could appear to be intelligent in a guessing game, then it could be assumed to be intelligent.", "The relationship between thought and matter was a common theme throughout Turing\u2019s life. As a teenager at Sherborne School, Dorset, he became closely attracted to a fellow student, Christopher Morcom, who was a year older. Morcom was, if anything, even brighter than Turing, and more devoted to mathematics and science. The pair became close friends, although Turing\u2019s love of Morcom was unrequited.", "Meeting Morcom was a watershed in Turing\u2019s life, acting as an emotional catalyst that converted the previously ill-focused, undisciplined but undoubtedly clever boy into a young man constantly attempting to improve himself. Morcom died, aged 18, from tuberculosis, and the rest of Turing\u2019s life seemed to be an attempt to keep Morcom alive and make him proud.", "If Morcom\u2019s friendship and death was material in Turing\u2019s intellectual development, it can also be seen as a focus for the complex ideas about intelligence and the mind that Turing developed towards the end of his own life. Writing to Morcom\u2019s mother soon after her bereavement, Turing said, \u2018when the body dies the \u201cmechanism\u201d of the body holding the spirit is gone and the spirit finds a new body\u2019. Even in his 1950 paper on machine intelligence Turing showed great interest in paranormal phenomena such as telepathy and psychokinesis that were at the fringes of scientific respectability even then.", "Turing\u2019s science remained resolutely off the mainstream. Having broken codes for the nation and conceived new paradigms in mathematics, computing and intelligence, he produced final work that was so avant-garde that it was virtually abandoned after his death in 1954, only to be picked up again relatively recently. Morphogenesis \u2013 the development of pattern and form in living things \u2013 occupied his thoughts for the last four years of his life as he ran computer simulations of the mathematics and chemistry of life itself.", "At Cambridge University , where he studied in the 1930s, and at wartime Bletchley Park, Turing\u2019s homosexuality was relatively tolerated. But in post-war Britain a new morality was rapidly emerging. Britain\u2019s future rested on repopulating the country with young men to replace the millions slaughtered at war. Homosexual people \u2013 men and women \u2013 were increasingly characterised as deviant and harmful to the fitness of the race, and their presence in society became a matter of national concern.", "The Cold War intensified these concerns, as gay people were assumed to be at risk of blackmail, endangering the security of the nation. Turing held some of the nation\u2019s most secret knowledge in his head.", "In 1952, following an unlawful sexual relationship, Turing was tried and convicted of \u2018gross indecency\u2019 under the anti-homosexuality legislation of the day. He was stripped of his security clearance and his post-war consultancy to Bletchley Park\u2019s successor, the Government Communications Headquarters ( GCHQ ), ended. He was offered a choice of imprisonment or a one-year course of hormone treatment to suppress his libido, and he took the latter. It was chemical castration.", "Turing appeared to recover well from the sentence after its effects subsided, but by then he was under police surveillance and it is likely that his actions had become of grave concern to the security services. On 7 June 1954 he ingested a large amount of cyanide solution at his home in Wilmslow, Cheshire and was found dead the next day by his housekeeper. The coroner recorded a verdict of suicide, opining that Turing\u2019s \u2018mind had become unbalanced\u2019.

This shattering event propelled the great Turing through a remarkable career .", "Morcom was Turing\u2019s first love, a fellow, older pupil at Sherborne School, Dorset, who shared Turing\u2019s passion for mathematics. Though Turing\u2019s crush was not reciprocated, he was profoundly affected by the death of his friend. In a contribution towards an anthology for Morcom\u2019s grieving mother, which is on display in the exhibition, Turing admitted that he \u2018worshipped the ground he trod on\u2019.", "Morcom\u2019s death cast a long shadow. Turing turned away from his Christian faith towards materialism, and began a lifelong quest to understand the tragedy. As he struggled to make sense of his loss, Turing pondered the nature of the human mind and whether Christopher\u2019s was part of his dead body or somehow lived on.", "Alan Turing is often portrayed as an isolated genius, even a borderline Asperger\u2019s loner. This traditional depiction is, perhaps, a weak reflection of homophobia of recent decades. But read about his feelings for Morcom, his letters and the correspondence of those close to him and you obtain a more complete portrait. Far from being the insular genius of popular belief, Turing could be warm and gregarious, though he did not suffer fools gladly and had an original take on the way he lived his life as much as he conducted his science.", "The October after the loss of his friend, Turing went up to Cambridge, where he studied mathematics. Our exhibition includes an essay, entitled \u201cNature of Spirit\u201d that Turing wrote the next year, in 1932, in which he talked of his belief in the survival of the spirit after death, which appealed to the relatively recent field of quantum mechanics and reflected his yearning for his dear friend.", "Around that time he encountered the Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics by the American computer pioneer, John von Neumann , and the work of Bertrand Russell on mathematical logic. These streams of thought would fuse when Turing imagined a machine that would be capable of any form of computation. Today the result \u2013 known as a universal Turing machine \u2013 still dominates our conception of computing.", "Turing\u2019s struggle to solve the codes of thought paved the way to his interest in cryptanalysis, the study of how to crack ciphers. Around the time of the Munich agreement in 1938 Turing began to help the UK government with the problem of deciphering German communication and this interest would culminate in an extraordinary effort during the Second World War when he worked for the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park.", "There Turing would break the codes of society too. In 1941, Turing had proposed marriage to Joan Clarke, a fellow cryptanalyst, but decided he could not go through with the marriage after admitting his homosexuality to his fianc\u00e9e, who was reportedly \u201cunfazed\u201d by the revelation.", "Turing\u2019s greatest challenge at Bletchley was the German enciphering machine, Enigma, three of which are on show in our exhibition (including one kindly lent by Sir Mick Jagger). He took particular responsibility for reading U-boat communications and led a team that designed the great \u2018bombe\u2019, a calculating machine that successfully decoded Germany\u2019s wartime messages. Eventually, over 200 were built, each weighing a ton, that made the noise of a \u2018thousand knitting needles\u2019 when in full flight.", "The breaking of the Enigma was vital, partly because it meant that the Allies could intercept messages to the U-boats that were attacking convoys, sinking merchant ships and threatening to isolate Britain. It\u2019s even been claimed that, without Bletchley Park\u2019s contribution, the war might otherwise have been lost.", "At that time a \u2018computer\u2019 was not a machine but a person, often female, who did calculations by hand. Machines were used too, but only for defined jobs, such as aiming bombs or solving differential equations. Combining his ideas from mathematical logic, his experience in cryptology, and the remarkable code cracking machinery of Bletchley, Turing\u2019s ambition was to create a computer in the modern, electronic, flexible sense.", "He joined the National Physical Laboratory , NPL, in Teddington in 1945 where his detailed \u2013 and world-beating \u2013 plan for an electronic computer was accepted in March 1946. But by then his remarkable wartime achievements were a state secret and he was not taken as seriously as he deserved. Frustrated, Turing resigned in 1948 though eventually, in 1950, his ideas came to life at NPL in the form of the Pilot ACE computer , which is the star of the Museum\u2019s Turing exhibition.", "The machine was the fastest in its day. This remarkable testament to Turing\u2019s inventive capabilities was in huge demand. Within the exhibition we show two vivid examples of how this pioneering machine was used: to reveal how metal fatigue caused the loss of BOAC Flight 781, a de Havilland Comet jet airliner; and the Nobel prize winning work by Dorothy Hodgkin to use X rays to unravel the molecular structure of Vitamin B12.", "On Midsummer Day 1948, the first prototype general-purpose computer, a true universal Turing machine, went into action at Manchester. And it was at Manchester University, when Turing was Deputy Director of the computing laboratory, that he wrote his highly influential 1950 paper, \u201cComputing Machinery and Intelligence.\u201d", "Turing had pondered how intelligence could arise in a machine, from operations which were themselves routine and, in a way, mindless. Perhaps it was possible to construct an artificial consciousness from blocks of cold mathematical logic.", "He had a practical suggestion: if a computer could fool people into thinking that they were interacting with another person, rather than a machine, then it could be classified as possessing artificial intelligence. This simple idea has proved hugely influential. Since 1991, an annual competition based on the \u2018Turing test\u2019 has been held by the American inventor Hugh Loebner .", "Turing was still haunted by the loss of Morcom. In his 1950 paper, he referred to research, perhaps by Samuel Soal in the UK, that there was \u2018overwhelming\u2019 statistical evidence of telepathy and remarked: \u201cOnce one has accepted them it does not seem a very big step to believe in ghosts.\u201d", "The next year Turing became interested in breaking the codes of life, furnishing a chemical basis for the means by which shape, structure and function arise in living things. It is known in biology as morphogenesis and had seemed so mysterious to some that it had fostered belief in vitalism, the idea that there was an \u00e9lan vital that was distinct from physical or chemical forces.", "Turing posed a basic question. How does an organism marshal a chemical soup into a biological structure or turn a spherical (symmetrical) bundle of identical cells into an (asymmetrical) organism? And why are there Fibonacci numbers (where each number is the sum of the previous two) in the leaf patterns of plants such as the close-packed spirals of sunflower heads? (our sister museum, the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester , has carried out a mass experiment to investigate). Turing\u2019s ideas have since led to some impressive descriptions of pattern formation in Nature, from snail shells to snake skins.", "With the help of Age UK, the Science Museum has consulted lesbian and gay people who were alive in the 1950s to understand the moral climate. What became clear was that Turing was remarkably open about his homosexuality, despite the repressive attitudes of the day. Perhaps his logic and his honesty made him feel that his orientation could never be seen as a crime. After the sheltered, liberal environments of Cambridge and Bletchley, he was in for a shock.", "Homosexuality was a criminal offence at the time and in February 1952 Turing was arrested for having a sexual relationship with a man, then tried and convicted of \u201cgross indecency\u201d. To avoid prison, he accepted treatment with the female sex hormone oestrogen: \u2018chemical castration\u2019 intended to neutralise his libido. In 2009 Gordon Brown, the then Prime Minister, issued a public apology for his treatment.", "In that era, homosexual people were considered a security risk, being open to blackmail. Turing\u2019s security clearance was withdrawn, so that he could no longer work for GCHQ, the post-war successor to Bletchley Park. He died soon after.", "The precise circumstances leading to his demise on 7 June 1954, at home in Wilmslow, Cheshire, can never be known. But Turing had himself spoken of suicide and this was the conclusion of the coroner, following an inquest.", "Next to Turing\u2019s body was an apple, partly eaten. Years before, as some biographers have pointed out, Turing had gone to see Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the pioneering Disney film, in Cambridge, and was particularly taken with the scene where the Wicked Witch dangled an apple into a boiling cauldron: \u201cDip the apple in the brew. Let the Sleeping Death seep through\u201d. One said that Turing had decided \u201cto invest his departure from a world that had treated him shabbily with some of the gothic, eerie, colourful brilliance of a Disney film.\u201d", "The pathologist\u2019s post-mortem report, reproduced in our new exhibition, suggests that the reality was more prosaic. The autopsy revealed that Turing\u2019s stomach contained four ounces of fluid that smelt of bitter almonds: a solution of a cyanide salt. His death was not accidental: there was enough poison to fill a wine glass. Turing, thought the pathologist, had taken bites from the apple to make his last drink more palatable.", "More than two decades earlier, when Turing was 17, he had had a vivid premonition of Morcom\u2019s death, at the very instant that his first love was taken ill. Turing felt that this was an omen, one that lay beyond what science was able to explain.", "Throughout his life he pursued the question of mind and body, believing that Morcom\u2019s spirit lived on. Perhaps his suicide was one last experiment. On that cold, wet Whit Monday, did Turing take his own life in the hope that they would be together once more?", "David Rooney is a Curator and Roger Highfield a Director at the Science Museum Group.", "Codebreaker: Alan Turing\u2019s Life and Legacy , opened at the Science Museum on the 21 June 2012 and ran until 31 July 2013."]},
