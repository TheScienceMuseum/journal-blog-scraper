","Collections and Objects,Science in the news","design,history of medicine,medicine galleries","As expected, the year 2020 has presented the opportunity for attention-grabbing puns relating to vision. The term ’20-20 vision’ is used in ophthalmological circles to express visual acuity, a person with perfect vision can read an eye-test chart from a distance of 20 feet.,However, metaphorically, the phrase has come to mean having focus and clarity but this meaning is often regarded as offensive and “ableist” to people with visual impairment.,It was this, the recently renewed gratitude for the NHS and the anniversary of its creation that led me to reflect on how my historical research on NHS glasses has inspired my current mission to support innovation in disability-related design.,I have always believed in the power of objects to convey meaning and to elicit memory and this happened at a talk I gave to the Costume Society back in 2017. After discussing how the reputation of NHS glasses had evolved from a much-despised medical appliance to a retro fashion accessory a lady shared a personal anecdote with me. She had worn NHS glasses as a child but her mother had insisted she removed her spectacles before leaving the house so that the neighbours did not see. The style of the frames was so recognisable as state-supplied spectacles that they had evolved into so-called ‘
badges of poverty
‘.,A factor that contributed to this social stigma was there were only a few styles available and those hadn’t been updated in forty years. This meant that individuals had little to no choice and therefore little opportunity to express their identity and personal style. For those who could not afford an alternative, this stigma had a lasting effect.,In 1985, when the ophthalmic industry changed as an NHS voucher system was introduced, there was an opportunity for choice, and this relationship certainly changed. Now, younger generations wear vintage NHS frames as a way of expressing their style.,In disability-related design, glasses are cited as an example to be aspired to.
Spectacles have evolved from a stigmatised corrective appliance that is dispensed in a clinical setting into a trendy fashion statement, with frames sold in retail stores and boutiques.,Other devices such as walking aids, orthotics, and prosthetics, can learn from this when thinking about design. As we’ve learnt from the past, design is hugely important and can have an impact far beyond its practicality, function, and aesthetic appearance.,So, to join the cliché I mentioned earlier, my vision for 2020 has certainly been re-framed from simply documenting the history of eyewear to exploring how to use the lessons learnt to support innovation in inclusive design.,Once the Science Museum has re-opened you can see more pairs of NHS glasses on display in
Medicine: The Wellcome Galleries
but in the meantime, we encourage you to explore our
online collection."
https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/science-city-meets-the-media/,Amrita Pal,Science City Meets the Media,Amrita Pal describes the latest annual encounter between scientists and journalists as a major new gallery was announced this week at the Science Museum.,At the Museum,science city,"Plans for an ambitious new gallery that describes how London turned into a global hub for science were announced this week at the annual Scientists Meet the Media event.,In September, the Science Museum will open
Science City 1550-1800: The Linbury Gallery
to show how the capital grew into global hub for trade, commerce and scientific enquiry over two and a half centuries, drawing on three internationally-important collections: our own, the King George III collection of King’s College and from the Royal Society, said Roger Highfield, Science Director.,The exhibition is curated by Alex Rose and Jane Desborough and supported by the Linbury Trust, National Lottery Heritage Fund, DCMS/Wolfson Museums and Galleries Improvement Fund and other generous supporters.,Highfield gestured at the panoramic view from the museum’s 5th floor
Illuminate
space to refer to a distant precursor of the annual Scientists Meet the Media event, at the original Gresham College, what is today Tower 42 – the NatWest Tower.,During the 1660s architect-mathematician Christopher Wren, chemist Robert Boyle and diarist Samuel Pepys met there and formed the Royal Society, which declared the Tudor philosopher Francis Bacon their spiritual father and championed a new and controversial method: experiment.,Highfield also wrote
an article in this week’s Evening Standard
that argued that this long history shows that London is well placed to weather current political uncertainty.,Professors, authors and editors aplenty attended the annual Scientists Meet the Media event, marking the 27th anniversary of the very first gathering in the Museum to foster mutual understanding between the inhabitants of Fleet Street, broadcasters and Britain’s laboratories.,The annual event is organised with the Royal Society, supported by Wired UK, and sponsored by
Johnson & Johnson Innovation
.,Julie Maxton, Executive Director of the Royal Society, said that London had for centuries been international, ‘outward looking and integral to the network of science.’,‘The threat of Brexit still hangs over us,’ she said. ‘None of us thinks that science hasn’t been affected…we, as the science community, that we must keep doing what we have done for centuries, and use science as a tool for international collaboration and good.’,Greg Williams
, Editor-in-chief, Wired, congratulated the winners of the annual ‘Oscars for science journalism’, organised by the
Association of British Science Writers
, ABSW, judged by Highfield among others, and presented by science author Gaia Vince and Emma Kohring from the awards sponsors Johnson & Johnson Innovation.,Williams talked of the importance of the media for science, in ‘convening communities of curious minds,’ and challenging the
untruths that propagate on the internet
.,Emma Kohring called the night a ‘wonderful evening of brilliant minds connecting!’ She then said, ‘Johnson & Johnson Innovation are proud to again be sponsoring both the ABSW awards and the SMTM.’,Kohring added: ‘Championing scientist and the people who tell these important science stories is critical to our vision to improve the lives of everyone, everywhere.’,Among the distinguished figures present were: Sir William Stewart, former Government chief scientist; Emma Kohring of Johnson & Johnson Innovation; Jason Chin of the Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge; Kayisha Payne, founder of Black British in STEM; Jess Wade of Imperial College London; Suhair Khan of Google Arts and Culture; Charlie Parsons, TV mogul; Margaret Gilmore, Deputy Chair of the HFEA; Prof Elizabeth Tanner, Queen Mary, University of London; Sir Phil Campbell, Editor-in-Chief of the publishing company Springer Nature; Prof Matthew Freeman, head of the Dunn School, University of Oxford; TV presenter Johnny Ball; Lesley Miles, Chief Strategy Officer, Royal Society; Steve Crabtree, Editor at BBC Horizon.,In reflection of the long running
science book prize
organised by the Royal Society, many leading authors were present including: Gaia Vince, author of Adventures in the Anthropocene; Adam Rutherford, author of The Book of Humans; Andrew Cohen of BBC Studios, author of The Planets with Prof Brian Cox; Oliver Morton, author of The Moon, and Geoff Carr, author of Genesis, both of the Economist; David Robson, author of the Intelligence Trap; Jo Marchant, author of Cure; Mark Miodownik, author of Liquid and Shannon Leone Fowler, author of Travelling with Ghosts.,Past Scientists Meet the Media events:"
https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/architecture-of-the-invisible/,Roger Highfield,ARCHITECTURE OF THE INVISIBLE,Science Director Roger Highfield describes an event with the distinguished chemist Sir John Meurig Thomas to celebrate the UK’s pioneering role in using X-rays to understand the molecular machinery of living things.,"At the Museum,Collections and Objects,Exhibitions and Galleries",,"When physics – in the form of X-ray diffraction – collided with biology in the middle of the last century, scientists were given an intimate glimpse of the vast, complex molecules that perform the fundamental processes of life.,To mark the publication of a new book about the British pioneers of the field, the Science Museum hosted an event this week with Sir John Meurig Thomas, a wizard when it comes to harnessing matter in the form of catalysts to eliminate the solvents and manufacturing steps of industrial processes, making them greener.,,Sir John’s distinguished career has seen him earn 23 Honorary Doctorates notably for his work on catalysts, such as zeolites and clays, where important chemical reactions could be speeded up inside their molecule-sized pores, chambers and cavities.,Interviewing Sir John was Science Museum Group’s Chair, Dame Mary Archer. Both are chemists; both overlapped at the University of Cambridge, when John was the Head of the Department of Physical Chemistry in the late 1970s-80s, and both have links to the Royal Institution, where Dame Mary did postdoctoral research and Sir John was later Director.,That is one of the reasons why, in 1991, Sir John was knighted “for services to chemistry and the popularisation of science”.,Sir John’s new book,
Architects of Structural Biology
, published by Oxford University Press, celebrates the 20th century fusion of chemistry and physics, which furnished a way to reveal the atomic structure of complex molecules with X-rays, using a method called X-ray diffraction.,In his book he focuses on four individuals – all of whom Sir John knew personally – who cleared the way for the routine use of X-ray diffraction, transforming medicine and the biosciences.,There was Lawrence Bragg (1890–1971), who first developed X-ray diffraction, where the scattering of X-rays (which can’t be focused) by a crystal are interpreted in terms of its atomic symmetries and structure. To do this, he devised an instrument that could take photographs of the spotty patterns made by scattered X-rays, called an
X-ray spectrometer
and the original (1910-1926) can be seen on display in the Science Museum’s
Making the Modern World Gallery
.,The other three pioneers in his book — Max Perutz (1914-2002), John Kendrew (1917-1997), and Dorothy Hodgkin (née Crowfoot, 1910-1994) – put this technique to work in biology.,In our collections, you can see Hodgkin’s molecular models of
penicillin
and
insulin
, while on display in
Medicine: The Wellcome Galleries
, stands Kendrew’s model of the muscle
protein myoglobin
, where the supporting rods are easier to see than the model itself, and nearby is Francis Crick and
James Watson
‘s
molecular model of the DNA
double helix, which revealed how heredity is passed down the generations. All these structures were determined by X-ray crystallography.,With these molecular models came understanding of how they worked. Take the example of haemoglobin, the red pigment in blood. In 1959, Max Perutz determined its
molecular structure
by X-ray crystallography, revealing it contains four atoms of iron, each held at the heart of an array of organic rings called a porphyrin, responsible for the red colour. That arrangement allows oxygen to ‘look but not touch’ and bind reversibly, so rust does not result.,Once you know the structure, you can understand how a genetic mutation in the gene for haemoglobin causes sickle cell disease, or why carbon monoxide is lethal.,Dame Mary and Sir John also discussed how the technique of X-ray diffraction has in part been overtaken by an extension of electron microscopy, called cryo-EM, which is
now reaching atomic resolution
, though Sir John believes there will still be heavy demand for conventional X-ray diffraction from pharmaceutical companies.,Cryo-EM was pioneered by Richard Henderson at the MRC’s
Laboratory of Molecular Biology
, LMB, in Cambridge, an institution that has garnered
many Nobel prizes
for uncovering the chemical structures of life, including one for Henderson himself.,In their discussion, Dame Mary and Sir John ranged from Dorothy Hodgkin’s
inspirational story
and the creative culture of the LMB to his unease about the effects of Brexit on international collaborations, such as work on synchrotrons, intense sources of X-rays, and at the Institut Laue-Langevin, a research reactor in Grenoble that is used as a powerful source of neutrons.,They also touched on Sir John’s extraordinary career which had unpromising beginnings near Llanelli, South Wales, where his father and brother were miners.,The options at that time were ‘to become a preacher, teacher or work underground,’ Sir John recalled.  His brother was 12 years his senior, and he reflected that if their births had been reversed, ‘I would have ended up a coal miner and he a professor. He was a very intelligent man, as was my father.’,Sir John’s interest in science was kindled as a teenager by his physics teacher at Gwendraeth Grammar School. ‘She was astonishingly good, talking about the great scientists such as Newton and Rutherford and at length about Michael Faraday. I was enthralled when I heard her describe how this man who had left school at the age of 13 with little knowledge, other than arithmetic, became a bookbinder’s assistant and then ended up being one of the greatest scientists of all time. I was in awe of Faraday from that moment onward.’,Later in life, Sir John would become the Fullerian Professor of Chemistry at the Royal Institution, London and then the Director, positions held by his hero. Sir John lived in the same living quarters that Faraday and his wife once occupied in the Royal Institution’s building on Albemarle Street.,During his inaugural lecture, sitting before him was Irene James, the brilliant and well-read schoolmistress who had first fired up his interest in science. ‘It was a great moment.’,Sir John earned his BSc in 1954 and doctorate a few years later from the University of Wales, Swansea, doing ‘quite well.’,After spending a year working at the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority as scientific officer, where he ‘rubbed shoulders with metallurgists who spoke a language I did not understand’, when it came to defects, dislocations and imperfections, and that inspired him to take an interest in their consequences for chemistry rather than the strength of materials.,He joined the Department of Chemistry at the University of Wales, Bangor where he rose through the ranks from Assistant Lecturer to Reader, and did research to reveal the profound influence that structural imperfections such as dislocations have on the chemical properties of solids.,While there he pioneered the use of electron microscopy – what he describes as his ‘single best’ decision in his scientific research. ‘I realise that if I wanted to study the chemistry of defects and imperfections in solids, and catalytic and reactivity, I needed an electron microscope.’,In 1959, Sir John married Margaret Edwards with whom he later had two daughters, Lisa and Naomi.,In 1969 he became Professor and Head of Chemistry at the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, where he broadened his interests in solid-state chemistry to create ‘ one of the finest Departments of solid state chemistry in Europe. That’s where I did a good deal of mineralogy also. And that is where my work on defects attracted the attention of Cambridge.’,It also caught the attention of the prestigious Royal Society. In 1977 he was elected a Fellow and, the following year, he joined the University of Cambridge as Head of the Department of Physical Chemistry, where he overlapped with Dame Mary in the late 70s/80s and continued working on new techniques such as neutron scattering (
on which I did my own research
) along with nuclear magnetic resonance, to study zeolites.,In 1986, BP used one of his patented acid catalysts to make hundreds of thousands of tons of ethyl acetate – in a single step – within the biggest plant of its kind in the world.,The same year, he was invited to succeed Nobelist Sir George Porter as Director of the Royal Institution.  At this time, Sir John began using synchrotron radiation and devised techniques which combine X-ray spectroscopy and high-resolution X-ray diffraction to determine the atomic structure of the active sites of solid catalysts as they worked.,He also devised new mesoporous, microporous, and molecular sieve catalysts, and ‘single site’ heterogeneous catalysts, which have uniform sites where the catalysis takes place.,In 1987, the BBC televised his
Royal Institution Christmas Lectures on crystals, with David Phillips
, continuing the tradition of lectures for children started by Faraday in 1826.,Sir John resigned as Director in 1991, due to his wife’s poor health, but remained associated with the Davy Faraday Research Laboratory of the Royal Institution until 2006. In 1991 he published the book Michael Faraday and the Royal Institution: The Genius of Man and Place.,After a time as Deputy Pro-Chancellor of the University of Wales (1991–1994), Sir John returned to Cambridge in 1993 as Master of Peterhouse, the university’s oldest college, until 2002, the year his wife, Margaret, died. In April 2010 Sir John married Jehane Ragai of the American University in Cairo.,Sir John is the author of around 30 patents, holds honorary positions in several universities, is the recipient of 23 honorary degrees, has been elected to honorary membership in over 15 foreign academies, and has garnered a range of awards. Of all those, ‘one of the nicest’ came in 1995, when Sir John became the first British scientist in 80 years to be awarded the Willard Gibbs Award by the American Chemical Society.,The mineral meurigite is named after him and when Sir John celebrated his 75th birthday with a series of events at Cambridge, they were attended by Nobel laureates and none other than the world’s best-known quantum chemist, Angela Merkel, whom he knew through her husband, computational chemist Joachim Sauer, with whom he had worked while at the Royal Institution.,Among the audience was Lord Rees, Astronomer Royal, and Sir Venki Ramakrishnan, Nobel laureate and President of the Royal Society In the foreword to Sir John’s book, Sir Venki writes that the term ‘molecular biology’ has now been co-opted to mean the study of information and control in living systems, and that Sir John’s book restores the term to its original meaning: ‘After all, the remarkable advances in our understanding of genetics and control would not have been possible without the structure of DNA, which, in turn, would not have been possible without decades of study of the structure of molecules using X-­ray diffraction.’"

Jack Kerouac
capturing post-war America on the page, or images of secretaries fiercely typing away, the typewriter has been indoctrinated into our historical and cultural heritage.,The place which marked the end of UK typewriter production was Ruabon, at the

diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime
and perhaps it is no wonder that the winner of the prestigious annual Max Perutz science writing award focused on research to defeat the disease which, as people live for longer, has affected ever more people.,Cancer is linked to ageing
and marked by a breakdown of cooperation between cells in the body, when one of the body’s
many hundreds of cell types
develops mutations – spelling mistakes in their
DNA
– that put the cell’s own interests above the greater good, so they multiply out of control.,Because cancer cells are distorted versions of normal cells in the body, they are hard to distinguish, and then difficult to destroy without causing damaging side effects to normal cells.,While chemotherapy, like surgery, can be effective at initially shrinking tumours,
cancer evolves
so that tumour cells that survive a treatment go on to multiply, passing on the protective traits that give them that survival edge so they can evolve to resist drugs, or grow faster, for example.,The winning entry to the
Medical Research Council Max Perutz Science Writing Award
,
published last weekend in the Observer
, was by Sarah Taylor from the MRC Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine at the University of Edinburgh, who looked at ‘teaching an old drug new tricks to fight ovarian cancer.’,In her research, Sarah focused on patients whose cancers are much more sensitive to chemotherapy treatment. One reason is that their DNA repair proteins, which are often defective in tumours, allow them to adapt and grow rapidly.,Her hope is to test drugs that block this protein from carrying out DNA damage repair, leaving the cancer powerless, unable to repair the damage inflicted by chemotherapy.,In
Medicine: The Wellcome Galleries
, you can see
pioneering research in this area
from The Institute of Cancer Research, London, that led to the development of olaparib, which has transformed the lives of thousands of women with breast and ovarian cancers.,Institute researchers found that targeting a DNA repair protein, called PARP, was a potential way to kill cancer cells, which led to the development of olaparib, and other so-called PARP inhibitors.,As if to underline the importance of cancer research, carried out by the MRC and charities such as Cancer Research UK, two of the
ten shortlisted entries
also wrote about cancer, breast cancer, the deadliest cancer in women worldwide, with more than two million cases diagnosed globally each year.,Kirsty Balachandran of Imperial College London, is studying the role of the hormone progesterone in breast cancer, which has long been debated.,To provide deeper insights, she treated breast cancer cells with drugs including oestrogen, progesterone and combinations, then studied the genes that go into action in these cells using a method called RNA sequencing. In the process, she generated over four terabytes of data to analyse – the equivalent of 2000 hours of high definition Netflix – to gain deeper understanding of the hormone.,The power of modern genetics to provide new insights into tumours was also underlined by the entry from Isabella Goldsbrough of Imperial College London, who focused on tailoring treatments based on the genetic mutations within a patient’s cancer.,Because cancer is marked by its rapid growth doctors have traditionally used drugs that are toxic to dividing cells but they affect all dividing cells in the body, causing side effects such as hair loss, nausea and so on.,In the long term, treatments based on deeper understanding of cancer genetics – precision medicines, such as olaparib – will increasingly offer an alternative to existing blunderbuss therapies such as chemotherapy.,Runner up for the prize was Julia Wcislo of the University of Dundee, who described her efforts to hunt the hiding places in the body of
Trypanosoma cruzi
, the parasite that causes
Chagas disease
.,For her work she tagged the parasites with a fluorescent protein, so they emit a bright green light when bathed in UV-blue light, and could reveal their hiding places using a method to make organs transparent, called tissue clearing.,Three shortlisted entries were commended:,Miranda Buckle, MRC Doctoral Training Partnership, University of Oxford, who described how EEG was being used to detect the brain activity of babies to tell if they were in pain.,Maria Stavrou, of the University of Edinburgh, who is growing healthy cells from the central nervous system – called astrocytes – with human motor neurons to compare them when grown with astrocytes from patients with motor neuron disease.,Fernanda Subtil of the Francis Crick Institute in London was commended for her article which focused on TB and the quest to find the mechanisms of resistance, so as to develop more effective antibiotics. This subject is explored in Superbugs, a Science Museum exhibition which has been

He talks about his work treating trachoma in the remote Turkana region of northern Kenya.,At the Museum,medicine,"In people’s homes, under trees, in classrooms – these are some of the more unusual places where I have performed the simple operation needed to treat advanced
trachoma
, the world’s leading infectious cause of blindness.,Trachoma is a bacterial infection transmitted through personal contact and a particular species of fly. If caught early enough, it can be treated with antibiotics but if it progresses, it can – very painfully – turn the eyelashes inwards causing scarring. Surgery is the only solution to restore some sight before the damage becomes permanent.,10 years ago when I became the first eye surgeon to treat local people with trachoma, the public health need was clear. Trachoma affects over 30 per cent of people living in arid and semi-arid areas of Kenya, and around the world, trachoma is responsible for blindness or visual impairment of around 1.9 million people.,I worked in this rural community with my small team, treating people in the early stages of trachoma with antibiotics, and carrying out surgery on the most severe cases – those with what is called trachomatous trichiasis (TT). Mostly, we do surgery wherever the patients are – with the right preparations made, it can be done anywhere using a mobile theatre.,We also started doing outreach work, finding new cases, and educating people in how to avoid the disease. Today this includes incorporating the
World Health Organization
’s
SAFE
strategy (Surgery for trichiasis trachoma, Antibiotics, Facial cleanliness, and Environmental improvement). We have made good progress with SAFE; all the areas it encompasses are important because in many rural communities, food and water are scarce and living conditions can be unhygienic, allowing the flies — which carry the disease — to multiply.,As the ophthalmic services co-ordinator in Turkana, I also work hard to ensure we make good progress towards training staff with the skills they need, building up the local infrastructure and monitoring cases with the use of a
digital app
.,The Kenya trachoma elimination programme started in 2012, and two years ago in 2018, we managed to clear a backlog of 11,000 people needing surgery in Turkana region. I have now performed eye surgery on more than 3,500 trachoma patients.,Many people struggle to get the surgery they need, either because they do not know that help is available or because the journey to hospital is long and treacherous. So, I have also travelled to mountainous and remote areas in other regions of Kenya, Uganda, and South Sudan to find people in need of such care.,I was trained to be a TT surgeon by the international charity,
Sightsavers
and one of its partners,
The Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Trust
. Sightsavers works to protect sight and fight for disability rights in more than 30 countries and continues to train trachoma surgeons to carry out this very important work.,Replicas of surgical instruments used by Samson are on display in
Medicine: The Wellcome Galleries
at the Science Museum. The museum
reopens to the public
on 19 August 2020.,This project was supported by The Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Trust, a time-limited charitable foundation established in 2012 to mark and celebrate Her Majesty The Queen’s Diamond Jubilee. In January 2020, the Trust successfully completed its programmes and ceased operating as a grant-making organisation having achieved a significant, sustainable reduction in avoidable blindness across the Commonwealth and created and developed a cadre of remarkable young leaders in honour of Her Majesty The Queen."

Guardian Live: Robot Surgery
. Medicine Gallery Curator Selina Hurley looks at the incredible machine that will be performing the procedure, the da Vinci Classic robotic surgery system.,,Lord Ara Darzi and his team used this system in 2000 to perform the first surgical procedure using a da Vinci machine in the UK. Guardian Live: Robot Surgery, will be hosted by Professor Roger Kneebone, a long-time friend of the Science Museum and well known for his
surgical simulations
. Lord Ara Darzi, Shirley Martin, Robotics Specialist Nurse and Helgi Johannsson, Anaesthetist will come together to re-enact the first surgical case, a gallbladder removal.,For medical robotics fans, (it can’t just be me), the da Vinci needs no introduction. Da Vinci has almost become synonymous with robotic surgery, being a market leader in the last 20 years. Since the da Vinci system launched in 1999, there have been constant improvements with the newest system, the Xi, launching in 2014. As of 30 September 2016, there were 3,803 da Vincis installed worldwide.,The system takes its name from the artist,
Leonardo da Vinci
, inspired by his study of human anatomy and his development of automatons and robots.,While operating, surgeons sit at the console, in another part of the operating theatre. Looking through two eyeholes the surgeon sees a 3D image of the inside of the body, provided by an endoscopic camera on one of the arms of the patient cart. The console reminds me of a gaming station with hand shaped joysticks and foot pedals. The pedals operate energy supplied to the instruments and move the endoscopic camera in or out bringing the surgical image closer or further away.,The surgeon’s hand movements at a console are translated into smaller, precise movements of tiny instruments, attached to the arms of the patient cart. Each of the specially designed instruments has seven degrees of movement – your wrist has just three. The system also helps reduce the impact of the natural tremor of a surgeon’s hand.,Watching such a massive machine produce such delicate and almost balletic movements is truly a remarkable sight.,Sparked by visits to robotic surgery centres, a da Vinci system has been on my curatorial wish list for quite some time.  The challenge is acquiring these systems due to their high costs. Happily, an opportunity presented itself while I was researching possible futures of surgery for the new
Medicine Galleries
in 2019. Lord Darzi kindly offered to donate the system to the Science Museum last summer, and since then it has been residing in our object stores. After its clinical life was over, this da Vinci, became a research tool at the Surgical Innovation Centre in St Mary’s.,Both the US and UK have strong traditions in the application of robotics to surgery. The idea for a robotic assisted keyhole surgery developed out of an attempt to bring surgery ever closer to the front line of battle and to astronauts in space. While this has not yet been realised, its application in the civilian sphere is ever growing.,That’s not to say that surgeons are not performing surgery at a distance. Using a Zeus robot, the first transatlantic surgery was performed on 7 September 2001. Known as “
Operation Lindbergh
” the surgeons in New York performed a gallbladder removal on a person in Strasbourg.,Personally and professionally, the Guardian Live: Robot Surgery, will be a highlight, hearing about a recent historical event first hand, with the actual robot in the room. This will be the da Vinci’s first outing event since its acquisition. The event on 10 March would not be possible without the kind support of Lord Darzi and Professor Kneebone and their teams at Imperial College and Intuitive Surgical.,See the da Vinci Surgical System in action at

The fuel – 800 kg of it – would be used by the spacecraft to help steer it on its seven-month journey to Mars and then to position it in a stable orbit of the red planet upon arrival.,Suhail had never worked with a fully fueled spacecraft before. The fueling was carried out just a few days ago and Suhail took time out from his busy schedule to talk about some of the other activities he and his team will be performing before and during the mission flight.,Suhail has been in Japan, where the mission will be launched from, since April. The spacecraft itself arrived separately by a mighty transport plane and a day before launch Suhail and colleagues will be monitoring its move to the launch pad.,With fingers crossed for a safe launch into a parking orbit of the Earth, not to mention good weather to allow the launch in the first place, Suhail will then be turning to a check out all of the spacecraft’s on-board systems.,Once all is passed ok the spacecraft is instructed to leave Earth orbit on its multi-million-kilometer journey to Mars.,Before Hope, Suhail worked on Dubai-Sat-1, an Earth Observation satellite.,Suhail explained how working on Hope has been entirely different. For a start, once an Earth satellite is in orbit there is relatively little the ground controllers need to do to keep it working – just the occasional instruction beamed up to adjust its orientation slightly.,But an interplanetary spacecraft like Hope, travelling from Earth to a different planet, requires careful monitoring by Suhail and his colleagues using different communication systems; one that is used when the spacecraft is near Earth and a more powerful one for bridging the enormous distances when it is approaching Mars.,Even so, it will take about 20 minutes for Suhail’s instructions to reach Hope at Mars and another 20 minutes for him to receive the spacecraft’s response!,This communication will also involve further collaboration with the team’s colleagues in the United States, this time with those teams receiving signals from Hope when that part of Earth is facing Mars.,It is this teamwork, in UAE, the United States and in Japan, that Suhail highlights as the most enjoyable part of his job.,As a boy he became interested in science and engineering and when an opportunity to work on space systems presented itself he said yes without a moment’s thought. It’s hard work, Suhail says, and the more of a challenge it is the better.,But he also knows how to relax, and he particularly enjoys science fiction stories like
The Martian
and, to stretch the imagination a little further,
Interstellar
.,But to budding space engineers of the future his advice is … just go for it.,The Hope mission successfully launched on its journey to Mars on 19 July 2020."
https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/powerful-amulets/,Annie  Thwaite,Powerful Amulets,Historian of medicine Annie Thwaite explores the rich and complex history of amulets and their connection to medicine. ,"At the Museum,Collections and Objects","history of medicine,medicine,medicine galleries","Which objects pop into your mind when you hear the word ‘amulet’? A four-leafed clover, an evil eye you got on holiday, or a lucky pair of pants?,Whether you have your own personal amulet or not, it might come as a surprise to you that the Science Museum Group has thousands of them in its
collection
. Amulets even have their own section in
Medicine: The Wellcome Galleries
, which opened last November. But what do they have to do with health and illness?,To many people these days, amulets might be something you carry with you because you’re a little superstitious, or,  maybe they make you feel safer. Yet, a few hundred years ago, amulets were a legitimate part of medicine. Indeed, in the early modern period (around 1500-1750) amulets were objects used to heal or protect a body or home. They could be made from a huge range of materials be that natural or humanmade, and often worked in ways that were not fully understood.,The amulets on display in
Medicine
, help show us just how diverse healing used to be. Today, we mainly focus on curing illnesses once we’re sick but hundreds of years ago in England, medicine was much more about preventing illness and misfortune, as well as restoring health. Amulets played a significant part in this maintenance of a healthy body and mind.,A great example of this is that Samuel Pepys, the Member of Parliament and early modern diarist famous for recording his account of the Great Fire of London in 1666, carried with him an object we may immediately recognise as an amulet – a hare’s foot. But contrary to popular belief, Pepys didn’t see his hare’s foot as a lucky object, or as something that might ward off illness. Rather, a colleague at Westminster recommended the method of carrying a hare’s foot as a means to cure Pepys’s painful colic.,Have you woken up in the middle of the night, unable to move a muscle? Well, four hundred years ago, the ‘nightmare’ was a well-known concept that we might refer to today as sleep paralysis, and, like us, people in the past wanted to prevent this terrifying experience. To do so, they would hang up naturally-holed stones beside their beds. As a result of their rarity and uniqueness, these objects were seen as a powerful facet of nature that would drive the nightmares from their beds.,Objects like these, which were well-known and widely used in early modern English medicine, are often labelled as amulets in museum collections today. Their connection with what we recognise as healing might not be immediately obvious, because over time, amulets became disassociated from medicine, and were often linked with good fortune and averting evil.,But researching amulets can reveal a wealth of information about health and illness in the past. They show us that medicine has a rich, complex and ever-evolving history, one in which these objects played a real, potent part.,So, next time you’re clearing out your drawers, have a look at the objects you’ve kept and think about what they signify to you. While you may not think they can truly protect you from danger or heal your ailments, amulets will always have the power to tell us more about the human experience.,For further explanation, see Annie Thwaite ‘

","At the Museum,Collections and Objects","art,discover the collection,flight,History of science,science city,Science City 1550-1800: The Linbury Gallery,women in science","Meet
Letitia Ann Sage
: an actress who, on this day in 1785, became the first English woman ever to take to the skies, in a hot air balloon. Although not the first woman in England to do so – the French sisters
Rosine and Leonora Simonet
had already made separate ascents with the balloonist
Jean-Pierre Blanchard
the month before – Sage was still among the pioneers. Indeed, the world’s first crewed, free-flying balloon flight had occurred less than two years earlier on 21 November 1783, when a balloon designed by the
French Montgolfier brothers
was launched in Paris.,Sage wrote (and later published) a remarkable account the day after her own exploit:
A Letter, Addressed to a Female Friend. By Mrs. Sage, The First English Female Aerial Traveller
. It makes for a highly entertaining read about the pleasures and indeed the perils faced by early balloonists.,Sage herself was very much aware of the ‘melancholy fate of poor Pilatre de Rozier’, who had become the first ballooning fatality only a fortnight earlier when his balloon caught fire and crashed. Still, Sage was not to be deterred, declaring that ‘I never had, since I first took up the idea, the least apprehension of danger’.,The launch site was St George’s Fields in Southwark, on the south side of London’s River Thames. A rotunda had been constructed around a stage and gantry from which the balloon was to ascend. The “pilot” was to be
Vincenzo Lunardi
, an Italian aeronaut who had already
flown a balloon in September 1784
– with a cat, dog and pigeon for company!,Sage and Lunardi were also to be joined by one Colonel Hastings, another unidentified lady, and Lunardi’s assistant
George Biggin
armed not only with meteorological instruments but also a ‘manly and becoming fortitude’.,Unfortunately, the balloon was unable to launch with so many passengers – even after the unidentified lady had already disembarked. Sage’s own rather buxom figure may not have helped matters; tactfully describing herself as ‘
en-bon-point
’, she later referred more explicitly to her ‘
two hundred
pounds of
human weight
’.,Lunardi, perhaps forgetting that he was chiefly responsible for flying the balloon, gave up his own place for Colonel Hastings ‘with a polite liberality that did him credit’. In the end, though, it was only to be
Sage and Biggin who took to the air
, at about 13:25 with the crowd looking up ‘in fixed and extatic [sic] attention’.,After a shaky start during which, Sage tells us, the balloon actually started to descend rapidly towards the crowd, they ascended. She and Biggin were carried westward more-or-less above the Thames, taking in the views of Westminster Bridge, St James’ Park and Piccadilly, and ‘the beautiful appearance of Battersea Bridge’.,They even sat down to enjoy some ham, chicken, and a glass of Florence wine (evidently these “essentials” hadn’t been jettisoned in the efforts to lighten the balloon prior to launch), before tossing the bottle overboard.,Sage included meteorological readings in her account, periodically throwing pieces of paper into the air to help establish the direction of travel. Biggin also had a thermometer and
hygrometer
to measure temperature and humidity respectively. He would have had a barometer, too, had Sage not accidentally broken it earlier in the flight.,Still, there were other observations to make: he rang a small bell to see if there was any difference in sound (there wasn’t), and used an electrical conductor to investigate the electrical properties of a passing cloud. At one point they flew directly through cloud – Sage reporting that she ‘was very cold for above five minutes, and felt a little difficulty in respiration; but it was not an unpleasant sensation’ – and even through snow.,About an hour into the flight, the balloon turned north-north-west and eventually landed in a field near Harrow-on-the-Hill, well beyond London’s outskirts at the time. The landing was anything but smooth: such was the force of the wind that Sage struck and injured her foot against a piece of iron, and a man on the ground attempting to help proved ‘of no service, as he was laid flat on his face’. It took several more onlookers to help bring the balloon to a stop, but not before most of them had been dragged along behind it for a distance.,Even then, the excitement was not over. The master of the fields, whom Sage described as ‘one of those beings, who, though they bear the
external
marks of humanity, have very little of the real character in their soul’, became ‘abusive, and savage to a great degree’ when he saw the apparently ‘
trifling
injury done to his property’.,Thanks in large part to the arrival on the scene of the pupils and master of nearby Harrow School, the tension was diffused, and the balloon thus saved from destruction. Sage and Biggin then enjoyed an evening of local hospitality, ‘many flattering attentions’ and ‘rustic compliments’, before returning to London – this time, by land.,Early hot air ballooning certainly divided opinion. While some argued for its merits as a feat of aeronautical engineering and a tool for making scientific observations, others dismissed it as a frivolous pursuit ripe for satire in the press. The craze for “Balloonomania”, though, was tangible: flights were commemorated in paintings, prints, and medals, on fans, items of clothing, snuffboxes and tableware.,For herself, Letitia Ann Sage felt ‘more happy, and infinitely better pleased with my excursion, than I ever was at any former event of my life’. Evidently, her neighbours were equally captivated: ‘The door is never quiet a single instant’.,You can find out more about early ballooning ephemera by exploring the Science Museum’s

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/a-flushing-story/,Kerry Grist,A flushing story,"Flushing toilets are a staple of our modern lives, but what we now take for granted is still a relatively new technological innovation. Assistant Curator Kerry Grist explores their fascinating history. ","At the Museum,Collections and Objects","discover the collection,engineering,Science Museum,technology","The problem of waste disposal is as old as time. Evidence of early waste disposal systems have been uncovered in archaeological sites across the world, including an approximately 5000-year-old drainage system found in the Scottish Orkney islands.,Despite this early evidence, simple
chamber pots
and cesspits continued to be the most common choice of waste depository until the late 1800s. So doing your business wasn’t the most private or comfortable experience until relatively recently.,Although if you could afford it you could have a very detailed design on
your personal chamber pot
– and maybe even somebody else to empty it for you!,It might surprise you to know that the first flushing loo in Britain dates back to the 1590s.,In 1596 Sir John Harington – Godson of Queen Elizabeth I – published ‘The Metamorphosis of Ajax’ where he
described a flushing device
which required 7.5 gallons of water to pump waste into the street or water source. He even claimed that it could be used by up to 20 people before flushing!,Harington had one installed at his home in Bath and later installed a working model for the Queen in Richmond Palace, but it clearly didn’t catch on. This could be due to such a huge water requirement in a time before plumbing, as well as the lack of sewers.,It took almost 200 years for Harington’s design to be successfully improved upon.,In 1775, Alexander Cumming – inventor and maker of
this stunning clock
on display in the museum – was granted the first English patent for a flushing loo.,His innovative addition of a built-in ‘S-pipe’ reduced odours by sealing off the toilet bowl and trapping water in the pipe to prevent any returning smells.,However, the flushing loo still had a long way to go. Whilst Cumming’s S-pipe helped reduce smells, the valves that released water to push out waste still fell short.,One of the most influential improvements was made by inventor and locksmith Joseph Bramah. His design, patented in 1778, improved upon Cumming’s by adding a
hinged valve
. It became one of the leading designs for the next century.,Until the 1850s, London’s waste removal mainly consisted of cesspits beneath houses or ditches that led waste into the Thames. Many communities outside of London had their own independent drainage systems.,Flushing toilets remained a luxury well into the 20
th
century, with non-flushing options such as outdoor ‘Earth closets’ especially popular in more rural areas.,This type of toilet
was patented in 1860 by Reverend Henry Moule, specifically to provide a more sanitary option for households without indoor piping. It releases clay to cover the waste and is similar to ‘composting’ public toilets often found at festivals and public events today.,Homeowners had been responsible for dealing with their own waste since a ruling of Henry VIII’s in the late 1500s. The British Government’s Public Health Act of 1848 transferred this responsibility into the care of local health boards, enacting that all new homes (and re-builds) should be equipped with a ‘means of drainage’.,This was the beginning of a commitment to centralise responsibility for public sanitation and the first stage in the creation of the
sewer systems
we so heavily rely on today.,However, the ‘means of drainage’ continued to empty waste into water sources, many of which were used for washing and drinking. This created issues, especially in the increasingly densely populated London, which were compounded with the rising popularity of flushing toilets.,The ‘Great Stink’ of 1858, when the smell got so bad that Parliament closed, and increasing outbreaks of water-borne diseases such as
Cholera
, forced the British government to act.,A 16-year sanitation project began very quickly that same year, with railway engineer
Joseph Bazalgette
at the helm. Over a thousand miles of drainage pipes were installed under the streets of London, feeding into 82 miles of sewers that led to 4 pumping stations across London via 6 ‘interceptor’ sewers.,This huge engineering feat that funnelled waste 8 miles downstream of the city, into the water source of less populated areas. Bazalgette’s brick lined sewers remain the foundation of today’s sewer system.,Right in the midst of this sanitary revolution, J.G. Jennings installed the first flushing public loos – or as he named them, ‘Monkey closets’ at the Great Exhibition. Known as a pioneer of sanitary science, Jennings also contributed to improving the flushing lavatory, patenting improvements to Bramah’s design in 1852 with a
wash-out design
that remained one of the most popular toilets throughout the century.,By the 1870s, the sanitary business was booming. There were multiple popular toilet designs made by a number of companies across the UK, but they all had limitations.,The wash-out toilet had complaints of noise, an insufficient, often failing flush and a tendency to splatter. Its popularity has been put down to the abundance of patented add-ons and improvements.,In 1870, Stevens Hellyer created the
Optimus
in an attempt to improve upon some of these complaints by improving the flushing mechanism.,Another innovator of the flushing bog was Thomas Twyford.,Twyford had been in the sanitaryware business since 1849, and his company still exists today as
Twyford Bathrooms
. During his career he also made improvements to Bramah’s design, as well as created a number of wash-out models, starting with the National in 1871.,In 1883 Twyford made a move away from metal and wood designs towards porcelain with the first one-piece porcelain loo, the Unitas. This design meant that the unit could be kept entirely clean. It also had the selling point of a hinged seat, so it could also function as a male urinal.,Before this, the toilet bowl had been entirely separate and a wooden enclosure was required to provide a seat. This was a direct improvement on Jennings’ wash-out closet, and Twyford continued to refine it throughout his life.,At this point, you may be wondering where Thomas Crapper comes into our story.,He clearly didn’t invent the toilet and this misconception may be due to his questionable advertising practices, which implied the invention of the Syphonic flush was his own. In fact, this significant contribution to the toilet was invented in the early 1800s (and patented in 1819) by the little known Albert Giblin.,Crapper took this design more than half a century later and popularised it, succeeding in taking the credit for its invention too. His royally warranted sanitary equipment company was the largest in the UK, and the first to utilise a showroom for mass-produced toiletry wares in 1870, further popularising in-house sanitation and toilet installation.,Crapper did invent several toilet add-ons, most notably adapting Cummings’ ‘S-pipe’ into the modern day ‘U-bend’. He held 9 patents, including the revolutionary ballcock and the unsuccessful ‘self-rising seat’.,His connection with the phrase ‘crapper’ was coincidental, as ‘crap’ had been used in relation to waste long before his lifetime. However, it is likely that the connection to toilets and excrement was strengthened and popularised with the size and success of his company, and ‘crapper’ branding emblazoned across all his products.,Toilets have even been adapted to work in under the low gravity conditions found when orbiting planet Earth. This
space toilet
design was used onboard Russian Soyuz spacecraft.,Astronaut Clayton C. Anderson
shared his experience
of using this type of toilet onboard a Soyuz spacecraft in 2007. Anderson is one of a small number of astronauts to have used a space toilet onboard four different spacecraft (a Soyuz, the International Space Station and Space Shuttles Atlantis and Discovery).,Like many inventions, the toilet was developed by numerous additions and adjustments over time, with no single ‘inventor’ who could claim the title. It is up for debate which designs were most significant and influential.,There are many historic innovations we’ve not included here, as well as endless modern innovations such as Japan’s hi-tech loos (some which even play music!) and
waterless toilets
(which you can see on display in
Medicine: The Wellcome Galleries
).,Sadly flushing toilets continue to be a luxury in many parts of the world. Around 2 billion people worldwide are still
without access to basic sanitation
such as a toilet. There is much more to be done to meet the UN’s Sustainable Development Goal of
providing adequate and equitable sanitation for all
.,To see some of the key innovations in the history of toilets (and find out what happens when you flush), visit

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/habitation-in-a-new-home/,Jack Monaghan ,Habitation in a new home,Today we installed a sculpture called Habitation in the museum. Jack Monaghan explains more in this blog post.,At the Museum,"art,technology","The sculpture was made 60 years ago by the French artist César, who welded together over 100 pieces of junk metal. It is on loan from
The Courtauld
, and is the second object from there to be displayed in the museum as part of the
McQueens Illuminating Objects series
.,The original date for installation was 26 March, the same week the COVID-19 lockdown began in the UK. The Science Museum had already closed to visitors, and we knew it would be quite some time before it could reopen. So today’s delayed installation feels particularly special.,My work as the McQueens Illuminating Objects Intern began in November 2019. Each intern selects an object from the
Courtauld’s collection
for display, and I already had
César’s sculpture
in my sights.,Habitation
had been the first object I mentioned in my interview for the post, when asked what kind of item I might like to explore. And, though I saw many beautiful and fascinating objects in the days I spent looking through the Courtauld’s treasure trove, no other artwork captured my imagination like this surprising and mysterious welded panoply of steel.,Once I’d chosen my object, the content development stage began. I had not counted on just how many people are involved in the creation of an exhibition. I met with the acquisitions teams at both institutions to draft the official loan letter; the web design team, social media team, and image copyright team at the Courtauld to create
the online content
; and the installation team and visual design teams at the Science Museum to decide on what the final display would look like.,And that was all for a single object from a single institution!,Next came the research. This for me was the most exciting part of my internship. Much of the research was done either in the
Dana Research Centre and Library
at the Science Museum, Imperial College Engineering library, or the archives at the Courtauld Institute – where I found some fascinating catalogues from
César’s early exhibitions
.,My favourite part of this research process was the chances I had to meet with experts. The first of these was Ben Russell, curator of mechanical engineering at the Science Museum. His passion for all things iron was infectious, and he really helped to bring the mysteries of this ubiquitous substance vividly to life.,I also met with Dr Shaun Crofton of Imperial College, London. Dr Crofton is a welding expert and explained this particularly technical skill to me with great humour, wit and an astonishing breadth of knowledge. My project is heavily indebted to both these brilliant minds.,After my meetings with the experts, my internship was focused on weaving the stories they’d told me, and those that the archives had revealed, into a engaging label and
webpage
.,After this process, the placing of this heavy and ungainly sculpture into its case in the Science Museum seemed the easiest part of the puzzle.,I have been unable to see
Habitation
for many months, with the closure of the Science Museum and Courtauld Gallery Archives due to COVID-19. After spending so much time looking at photos, it was a special moment to be able to stand back and admire the real thing.,I hope that museum visitors are as surprised by it as I was when I first saw it.,And I hope those visitors find, as I did, that

Stephanie Millard explores the stories behind the heroines.,Exhibitions and Galleries,"medicine,war,women in science,wounded","At the start of the First World War many people harboured the view that war was ‘man’s business’. Front-line roles had, after all, always been undertaken by men.,Between 1914 and 1918 opinion changed when women – invigorated by years of struggle for female emancipation – stepped out from their traditional roles and placed themselves at the heart of the action.,Taking on key medical roles, they emerged from the conflict with newfound respect and observers heralded the war as ‘a revelation of woman’.,Trained nurses had been part of the military establishment since the 19th century. Thousands of untrained women now stepped forward to help support the care of the wounded.,Within the
Wounded
exhibition
we hear the voice of Sophie Hoerner, who was stationed at No. 1 Canadian general hospital near Étaples. She paints a vivid picture of the scale and severity of the task faced by nurses as they cared for the wounded at the Western Front.,In a letter home she wrote:,‘No one could imagine the horrors of a war like this unless they are here and could see for themselves. I have never seen such awful wounds.’,The job of the war nurse was both varied and hectic. Some administered pain relief and redressed wounds. Others assisted the surgical teams in the operating theatres of casualty clearing stations, acting as anaesthetists or carrying out minor procedures when surgeons were rushed off their feet.,Female surgeons
found it far harder to offer their services. The army was initially reluctant to make use of their skills, telling them ‘to go home and sit still’.,Undeterred, they set up voluntary hospitals on the Western and Eastern fronts – many staffed exclusively by women. One such volunteer was Dr Phoebe Chapple, who became one of the first at the front line and the first to be awarded a medal for gallantry.,On 29 May 1918, while she was visiting the Queen Mary’s Army Auxiliary Corps near Abbeville, the camp came under enemy attack. One bomb hit a trench where 40 staff had taken cover. In near darkness and with further risk of attack, Chapple worked her way along the trench, tending to the wounded.,Women also provided a vital link between the battlefield and medical units. The
First Aid Nursing Yeomanry
(FANY) ran field hospitals and drove ambulances, often in extremely dangerous conditions.,Pat Waddell, an accomplished violinist, acted as an ambulance driver from 1916 onwards, having learned to drive in London by cajoling taxi drivers to let her take control of their vehicles. The FANYs challenged the traditional view of women drivers. One sergeant wrote:,‘When the cars are full of wounded no-one could be more patient, gentle or considerate, but when the cars are empty they drive like bats out of hell.’,Mairi Chisholm and Elsie Knocker travelled to Belgium as part of the Munro Ambulance Corps designed to support the Belgian Red Cross and transport the injured to hospitals away from the battlefield. They quickly decided that they could be of greater help to the wounded by treating them closer to the front line.,They set up their own dressing station in Pervyse near Ypres – only 90 metres from the action. Earning 17 medals for their bravery they became celebrated in the press as the ‘Angels’ of Pervyse, having saved hundreds of soldiers’ lives.,Perhaps the most famous woman to work at the front line was
Marie Curie
. By the time war broke out she was already a double Nobel prizewinner –
one for physics
(the
first Nobel Prize to be awarded to a women
), the
other for chemistry
.,Curie was shocked to see how soldiers’ lives were being lost because they had to be transported long distances for examination.,So she set about bringing diagnostic equipment to the battlefield.,Twenty vehicles were fitted out with X-ray units, darkrooms and technical personnel. Curie learned to drive so she could operate one of the mobile cars herself.,She also set up 200 stationary X-ray stations, helping train 150 women as radiology technicians to help run them.,Over 1 million wounded soldiers were examined thanks to her efforts, with Curie herself declaring:,‘The use of X-rays during the war saved the lives of many wounded men and saved many more from long suffering and lasting infirmity.’,Women’s front-line activity did not end there.,They acted in many other important roles, from telegraphist and cook to war correspondent and spy. Added to the vital work being carried out by female workers back at home, these varied roles show that the First World War was not just a conflict that made heroes, but many heroines as well."

remarkable story is “heart-breaking and shocking, but important to tell” said
Morten Tyldum
, Director of The Imitation Game, at a special preview screening at the Science Museum`s IMAX theatre.,Turing was “a puzzle and a mystery to explore” continued Tyldum when asked about his inspiration for making the film. He “wasn’t just a mathematician, he was a philosopher. It’s a tragedy he couldn’t stay with us longer” he added during a conversation with Dave Calhoun, Global Film Editor of Time Out about the making of the film, to a packed audience.,The conversation touched on the importance of authenticity – by finding locations (Turing’s old school and
Bletchley Park
) that worked best to tell the story, and praised the efforts of the actors for their emotional performances.,Roger Highfield, Director of External Affairs, began proceedings by welcoming guests and thanking Studio Canal for choosing the Science Museum as the venue for the screening. He declared that “the making of this film represents yet another welcome sign that Turing is at long last getting the recognition that he so richly deserves.”,He spoke of the growing public recognition of Turing’s incredible achievements, demonstrated by a recent public poll, in which over 50,000 people voted, in which Turing’s Universal machine emerged as the most important innovation in science and technology in the past century. The vote demonstrated that “even arcane mathematics can garner popular support”, which the Museum is keen to exploit in the forthcoming
Mathematics gallery
opening in 2016.,He then moved onto
Benedict Cumberbatch’s
visit to the Museum’s  award-winning Turing exhibition to help his preparation for the role of Turing and the
Pilot ACE computer
, now one of the star objects in the new Information Age gallery, before giving a warm welcome to Tyldum.,At an earlier drinks reception in the
Information Age
gallery, an Enigma machine, brought out specially for the event, attracted crowds as Tyldum was joined by members of Turing’s family to pose for photographs.,The reception provided VIP guests including
Sir Paul Nurse

atmosphere
, a gallery exploring climate science. Three years on and the Museum is a partner in a
commercial venture
to build the UK’s largest solar farm on a disused airfield it owns near Swindon. The project will eventually generate 40mw of electricity, enough for 12,000 homes.,Here in microcosm is what is taking place in countries around the world as our understanding of the threat of climate change deepens and slowly prompts action to transform the energy infrastructure on which we rely. Are the many piecemeal actions of this kind enough to leave us feeling confident?,The
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
has recently confirmed the likely consequences of continuing to pump greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere. As a global community, we are about as well informed on climate science as we might hope to be. But the uncertainties that surround climate change still leave us guessing where things are likely to come out.,There are three big uncertainties. The first is how fast humanity will cut carbon emissions. For the moment, we are on track to double atmospheric carbon dioxide by some point in the second half of the century. The second is how the climate will respond. A widely used indicator is the change in global average surface temperature when carbon dioxide concentration doubles. The best estimate is in the range 1.5 to 4.5 degrees centigrade. The third uncertainty is the impact of such a change on future human wellbeing and the material damages it might cause.,In the absence of stronger action than is currently evident there is a finite risk that we could hit 4 degrees of warming in the second half of the century, with the possibility of amplifying feedbacks locking in further temperature increasing processes over which we would have no control. The resulting climate changes would play out over centuries and millennia, producing permanent climate instabilities and shifts not experienced over human history.,Risk could be reduced by policy changes among the principal emitters. By far the simplest action would be an agreed price for carbon emissions to accelerate the piecemeal transformation of energy infrastructure already underway. We might also get lucky if it turns out that the response of the climate to emissions lies at the lower end of the range. We should know where we stand in the next few decades. Meanwhile we might reasonably spend a moment on the implications of a 4 degree world.,Here we are again beset with uncertainty. We don’t know with precision how fast polar ice sheets will disintegrate and sea level will rise. Nor do we know how climatic zones may shift or how higher average temperatures and rainfall will combine with more frequent weather extremes and changing weather patterns to disrupt water supplies and agriculture.,The pattern of cereal production could be significantly affected. Cereal demand may double by 2050 in response to population increases and changes in food preferences. This demand might be met by improved technology and waste elimination. Weather extremes and instability at 4 degrees may cut crop yields significantly, creating a further gap to be filled, perhaps by genetically improved robustness and the cultivation of newly productive northern lands.,Geo-engineering might provide a temporary window of opportunity for a crash programme to decarbonise economies and sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide, although with a substantial risk of unintended and unwelcome consequences. On the other hand we might have to cope with disruption triggered by populations seeking to move from areas rendered inhospitable by inundations, floods, drought, extreme temperatures, fires and local shortages of food and water.,How all of this will play out is clearly impossible to say. Optimists believe that with luck, free markets and technological ingenuity we could rise to a 4 degree challenge if we can’t avoid it altogether. Pessimists argue that 4 degrees is beyond adaptation and may lead to a period of dislocation. Either way our lives are likely to be transformed in the next few decades as we thoughtfully re-engineer food and energy production and relocate climate migrants or rather more chaotically seek to respond to the multiple pressures of population growth, energy needs and climate disruption.,The UK is relatively small, open and unprotected and may not do well in the face of climate disruption. On the other hand it is highly creative and nurtures much scientific and technological talent. Its leading universities are rich in individuals and teams who understand the technologies of a low carbon future. It has an opportunity to lead an industrial revolution that is poised to happen. The case for maximising long-term value and reducing risk by seizing this opportunity is powerful.,Preventing dangerous climate change is principally a matter for the world’s largest emitters. The UK, however, has set an example by adopting tough emissions targets and by using its international influence and scientific strength for the good. It should continue to advance policies that spur a new industrial revolution from which it could benefit greatly, while heading off a climate transition that it may struggle to cope with.,The Science Museum is one of the world’s finest institutions in which to explore the history of science and technology. It is greatly to its credit that it is not only informing its visitors about the
climate challenges
ahead but also playing its part in dealing with them.,Howard Covington is a trustee of the Science Museum.

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/enola-holmes/,Dr Elizabeth Bruton,The true stories behind the tech in Enola Holmes,"Curator Liz Bruton reveals the true stories behind the Victorian technologies of bicycles, steam trains, and cipher wheels depicted in the 2020 Netflix film Enola Holmes.",Collections and Objects,,"[Curator Liz Bruton looks straight to camera]: Now where to begin?,The first thing you need to know is that
Enola Holmes
, a Netflix film released in September 2020, depicts the social, political and technological developments of Victorian Britain – a world on the brink of change in the mid-1880s.  Here, we meet Enola Holmes, the sixteen-year old younger sister of Sherlock and Mycroft Holmes played charmingly by Millie Bobby Brown.,,Enola has been brought up a “wild child” (at least according to her brothers) or rather a curious and intelligent young woman, broadly educated by her mother Eudoria in
astronomy
,
beekeeping
,
reading
,
scientific experimentation
, sports including
Ju-jitsu
, and mental exercises such as word games and
chess
– all subjects widely represented within the Science Museum Group collections.,Which leads me onto the second thing you need to know: on the day of her sixteenth birthday, Enola awakes to find her mother Eudoria has left their countryside home and has gone missing.  Enola calls in her older brothers, the famous young detective Sherlock Holmes and Mycroft Holmes, to help find her mother but soon realises it is up to her to solve the mystery herself.,This leads (spoilers ahead!) to her ditching her brothers and heading to London to search for her missing mother and becomes involved in the case of the missing Viscount wrapped within the wider political context of feminism, suffragettes, and the
Third Reform Act
, a law to extend male suffrage or the right to vote.,Alongside the politics of 1880s Britain,
Enola Holmes
demonstrates various Victorians technologies available – if not always affordable – to the masses, in particular bicycles, steam trains, and cipher wheels.  But what are the true stories behind their dramatic version?  The game is afoot…,Enola Holmes
opens dramatically with our central character pedalling furiously on her safety bicycle, noting when she comes a cropper that “bicycles are not my core strength”.  Enola speeding along on her bicycle echoes the front cover of
The Case of the Missing Marquess
, the first novel in the young adult fiction series
The Enola Holmes Mysteries
by Nancy Springer – Enola Holmes did not appear in the original Sherlock Holmes series by
Arthur Conan Doyle
.,The modern bicycle has its origins in developments in cycling in the late 1800s, including developments such as pedal drives, tyres, and frame design.  In the 1860s,
the ‘boneshaker’ bicycle
was developed in France and became widely around the world including in Britain.,It was the first bicycle with a pedal drive so the bicycle’s motion was powered by pedal motion rather than feet along the ground.  However, ‘boneshaker’ bicycles had two different sized wheels and was an uncomfortable ride.,Another bicycle with uneven wheels was the
penny farthing or ‘ordinary’ bicycle
, popular from the 1870s onwards.  With a large front wheel, these bicycles could go further with each turn of the pedals – but riding so high up was awkward, unstable, and dangerous.,Lastly, the modern bicycle reached fruition with the
Rover ‘safety bicycle’
designed by British inventor John Kemp Starley and introduced in 1885.  It had all the basic features of standard modern bicycles, including a diamond frame, chain drive to the back wheel, and equal-sized wheels.  These features meant the bicycle became an easier and safer ride, leading to cycling becoming enormously popular, among both men and women.,Women became involved in cycling for transport, leisure and
racing
by the late 1890s and for some it was a form of social mobility and feminism.  Enola Holmes’ cycling as an expression of her independence, feminism and rapid transport reflects the wider experiences of women and cycling in the late 1800s although her bicycle in 1884 would have been more likely to have been a ‘boneshaker’ or penny farthing rather than the ‘safety bicycle’, which was only available from 1885 onwards.,In “phase 2” of her plan to find her missing mother, Enola escapes her brothers and meets Viscount Tewkesbury on a passenger steam train travelling to London.  In reality, this is Great Western Railway (GWR)
steam locomotive 2857 and vintage carriages
belonging to the
Severn Valley Railway
, a full-size standard-gauge railway line, running regular, mainly steam-hauled, passenger trains between Kidderminster in Worcestershire and Bridgnorth in Shropshire.  The
steam locomotive GWR 2857
was completed in April 1918 and was designed to haul goods rather than passengers.,Rail travel in Britain has originated with
Robert Stephenson’s
Rocket
and the Liverpool & Manchester Railway (L&MR) railway locomotion trails at Rainhill in October 1829.  The outcome of the trails was to determine which design for a self-propelled steam locomotive could be used for the efficient transport of goods and passengers as Britain’s Industrial Revolution thundered ahead.  This was a story of
innovation, ingenuity and personal rivalry
which led to a world-changing transport revolution.,Between 1829 and the early 1900s, Britain pioneered the more revolutionary development of railways, delivering significant economic and social benefits and transforming the transport of goods and passengers.  A train used in 1884 would have looked more like
NER 0-6-0 ‘1001’ class steam locomotive and tender, No 1275, 1874
, in use from 1874 to 1923 and now on display in the Great Hall at the National Railway Museum.,Trains like this would have transported passengers and goods throughout Britain from the mid-1800s onwards. However, corridors connecting compartments and carriages were not introduced until around 1900 which would have made for a much shorter chase scene and so a far less exciting and life-threatening journey as that experienced by Enola Holmes and Viscount Tewkesbury in
Enola Holmes
!,Codes and cipher disks form a central part of the mystery of the disappearance of Enola’s mother Eudoria.  After eventually arriving in London, Enola places a series of encrypted messages in different London newspapers in the hope that her mother will read and decipher them and reply in turn.  We learn that word play was a favourite hobby of Eudoria’s and that she had taught Enola how to use codes and ciphers to send and receive secret messages.,Enola eventually receives a reply, allegedly from her mother, and uses the cipher disk or cipher wheel left behind by her mother to decipher the message to reveal the original message of the newspaper advertisement.  This is true to Victorian newspaper advertisements which did sometimes feature
secret messages left in the personal or advertisement columns
of newspapers.,Cipher wheels were developed from the mid-1800s to automate encryption. They took each letter of a message and moved it down the alphabet a fixed number of places to produce the encrypted message.  Telegraph pioneer Charles Wheatstone developed the
Cryptograph cipher wheel
around 1870. It could encrypt telegraph messages quickly and easily but was also insecure as the cipher could be easily broken.,Enola Holmes
depicts a world on the brink of political, social and technological change – from bicycles bringing independent transport and mobility to the masses, including women, through to trains transporting goods and people at speed across the land and increasing the urbanisation of Britain.  These technologies created new networks of communications and transport and with increased communication came the need to send secure messages, enabled by cipher wheels and other means of encryption.,Although this Netflix film depicts specific examples of bicycles and trains not yet available in the time setting of 1884, more broadly the film has much to teach us about the late Victorian technologies of trains, bicycles and cipher wheels transforming people’s lives – especially women’s lives – and the world in the 1880s.,Sources and further reading,Enola Holmes (2020):

will be cosmonaut-flown spacecraft, pioneering rocket engines, space suits and other life support systems. There will also be examples of the personal and poignant – memorabilia belonging to some of the biggest names in spaceflight.,The director of the Science Museum, Ian Blatchford, said such an exhibition, the equivalent in impact of the British Museum’s landmark Tutankhamen exhibition, had been a dream of Deputy Keeper, Doug Millard, for more than two decades.,‘Russia’s Space Quest’
, which is being led by curators Doug Millard and Natalia Sidlina, represents a major collaboration between the
Moscow State Memorial Museum of Cosmonautics
and the Federal Space Agency,
Roscosmos
, and draws on the support of many institutions and individuals in the UK and Russia.,Mr Blatchford said that it was important to have this exhibition to capture the excitement of the early years, while scientists, engineers and technicians from the Russian quest were still alive: “It is imperative that we do this exhibition now, before their stories are lost – as that would be a terrible blow.”,‘Russia’s Space Quest’ will also explore the science and technology of Russian space travel in its cultural and spiritual context, revealing a deep rooted national yearning for space that was shaped by the turbulent early decades of the twentieth century.,The dream of the
Cosmists
became a reality between October and November 1957, when
Sputnik
and then Laika the space dog were launched, and 1961 when the rest of the world watched in astonishment as  a Russian man became the first human to look down on our fragile blue world.,This week
Intandem Films
and Russia’s Kremlin Films joined the Russian Embassy to host a special screening in the Museum’s IMAX of the $10 million budgeted biopic Gagarin: First in Space.,The movie, directed by Pavel Parkhomenko, is produced by Oleg Kapanets and Igor Tolstunov and stars Yaroslav Zhalnin, Mikhail Pilippov and Viktor Proskurin.,The film dramatizes the story of how Yuri Gagarin was selected from over 3,000 fighter pilots across the USSR to take part in his country’s space program, that culminated in him blasting off in a Vostok rocket on April 12, 1961, after several failed unmanned launches.,The screening at the museum was hosted by the Russian Ambassador Alexander V Yakovenko, who praised Russia’s Space Quest as one of the  most important cultural events staged and supported by the U.K. and his country, and attended by Culture Minister Maria Miller.,The biopic was introduced by Yuri Gagarin’s daughter, Elena Gagarin, who said the world changed forever after her father made the first manned flight into space."

Early Birds
.,A few times a year we open the museum from 08.30 in the morning for Early Birds, a free event for children who have an Autistic Spectrum Condition (ASC) and their families. This gives families a chance to look around our galleries and take part in fun activities before the Museum opens at 10am. We even keep some galleries closed a little longer, just for our
Early Birds
visitors.,For people with an autistic spectrum condition, it can be difficult to be in a busy environment or even waiting in a queue. They can be particularly sensitive to light or sound which can make being near some of our interactive exhibits unpleasant. All of these factors can make it difficult for children who are on the autistic spectrum to visit the museum during our usual opening hours.,For Early Birds, we wanted to create an environment where families would feel safe, happy and could still enjoy visiting the museum. This might mean turning off the sound on some of our louder exhibits or simply creating a nice sensory space where families can go and chill out if they want a break. We also created a
Visual Story
for families to help prepare for what they might see in the museum.,We have already run a few Early Birds sessions (one family has written about their experience

Information Age
, a new gallery exploring communication technologies.,Radio operators on board ship used to be nicknamed ‘Sparks’ – and with good reason. In the earliest days of ‘wireless telegraphy’ the radio waves were created by a continuous train of high-voltage sparks. The phenomenon can be observed whenever you switch a light on or off if a radio set is switched on nearby. At the moment the switch connects or breaks the mains circuit, sparks are created which send out pulses of radio waves which will be heard as a momentary crackle through the set’s loudspeaker.,On board ship, generating equipment continuously charged up capacitors which spontaneously discharged at high voltage across a spark gap. The radio operator used a morse key (a simple on/off switch) to interrupt the sparks in the form of morse code. The resulting coded radio wave ‘oscillations’ could be heard by other ships within a radius of a hundred miles or so. This was the method of transmission in use at the time of the
Titanic
disaster in April 1912. Jack Phillips and Harold Bride, the operators on the
Titanic
, sent out their distress signals in this way which were picked up through the headphones of operators on board other ships with range.,In the 1920s the use of spark transmission was phased out as more efficient transmitters using thermionic valves or ‘tubes’ were introduced. These could be tuned to a much more precise frequency so were less wasteful of the radio-frequency spectrum than spark transmitters. Today almost nobody will have
heard
the sound of a radio message sent by spark.,Consequently when we decided to feature the
Titanic
disaster in our new
Information Age
gallery, we felt we should re-create some of the morse distress messages so they could be heard by visitors much as they had been in 1912.,In order to do so we had to find a specialist radio historian with a suitable spark transmitter. One such individual is Dr Tony Constable, the founding Chairman of the British Vintage Wireless Society. Recently I visited his home in west London.,He had set up a suitable induction coil, Hertz-type spark gap and morse key in his living room, set to work at the lowest possible power so as to avoid, as far as possible, interference on neighbours’ radios.,Together we worked out a couple of messages, adapted from the original transcripts. This from the
Titanic
:,SOS SOS SOS CQD CQD CQD TITANIC STRUCK ICEBERG,and this from the rescue ship
Carpathia
:,TITANIC CALLS CQD HIS SIGNALS BLURRED AND END ABRUPTLY,CQD was the original morse distress signal. It had been replaced by SOS before 1912 but at that time both were still used by some operators.,Tony placed an vintage Bush transistor radio on the other side of the same room and de-tuned it on medium wave away from any programmes so that it just gave out a hiss. The morse signals were clearly audible as a harsh buzzing, incidentally demonstrating the un-tuned nature of spark transmission.,As you can
hear
, the recordings were very successful. A word of warning, though. The equipment, though simple, uses very high voltages and must be handled with extreme care. We don’t recommend you try this particular experiment yourself.,Discover more about the history of communication technologies in our new

JJ Thomson
, was an incredible treat, and an experience I will never forget.,I had read lots about Thomson’s famous experiments on the electron – the first subatomic particle to be discovered – but to actually see and touch his apparatus myself, to notice the blackened glass and the tube’s minute features that are omitted in books, brought the object to life. History suddenly seemed tangible.,Using more than one cathode-ray tube in 1897 for his experiments, Thomson managed to identify a particle 1,000 times smaller than the then known smallest piece of matter: a hydrogen atom. Cambridge’s
Cavendish Laboratory
, where Thomson spent his scientific career, also has an original tube in its collection.,Each tube was custom-made by Thomson’s talented assistant, Ebenezer Everett, a self-taught glassblower. Everett made all of Thomson’s apparatus, and was responsible for operating it – in fact, he generally forbade Thomson from touching anything delicate on the grounds that he was “exceptionally helpless with his hands”.,The quality of Everett’s glassblowing was absolutely crucial for the experiments to work.,Cathode-rays are produced when an electric current is passed through a vacuum tube. Only when almost all the air has been removed to create a high vacuum – a state that would shatter ordinary glass vessels – can the rays travel the full length of the tube without bumping into air molecules.,Thomson was able to apply electric and magnetic fields to manipulate the rays, which eventually convinced the physics world that they were composed of tiny particles, electrons, opposed to waves in the now-rejected ether.,Find out more about Thomson and the story of the first subatomic particle

Though we’ve done maths before. We won a BAFTA for our psychedelic preschool maths show ‘
Quiff and Boot
’. Yes, that’s right, psychedelic maths. We also once explained Calculus using zombies. We’ve also done a bit of biology – dinosaurs to be precise – which was fun. We had to summarise 165 million years in 3 minutes. That’s efficiency for you.,Was it a challenge to cram so much particle physics into a two-minute animation?,Well, the challenge is where the fun lies. We were lucky that
Harry Cliff
at the Science Museum provided us with a wonderful visual explanation. Since we understood it, and we’re definitely not physicists, we knew that others would too. It was a great starting place from where we could then construct the backbone of the narrative. The next thing was what kind of a story did we want to tell, and what kind of characters would be in it.,How did you find physics compared with other topics you have worked with?,I think physics is one of those subjects that does both frighten and fascinate people. Everyone seems to have a drop off point, a point where you go ‘yes I understand that, yes I understand that’ and then ‘no I have no idea what you just said’. It’s such a fundamental science and some of it seems so deep and complex that on the face of it almost seems like magic, especially when you start talking about time moving at different rates and space being curved. On the other hand, it’s all about stars and forces and time and looking to beyond and imagining what’s out there and how it all works, so it’s a beautiful science too.,Where did the names Max and Tangle come from?,Well we wanted to take some characters from the world of physics so the cat is supposed to be
Schrödinger’s Cat
. Schrödinger coined the term entanglement, and Tangle sounded like a good name for a cat. We just needed a second character and
Maxwell’s Demon
was mentioned to us, and hey presto we had Max.,How did you decide on what the personalities of Max and Tangle would be like?,A lot of it came out of the question, ‘why would someone explain in a conversation all this information about particle physics?’ It seemed logical that one was clued up and clever and the other not as smart. Then it seemed like this could be a game of one-upmanship. So the less smart one needed their own advantage to balance things out, for Max that had to be his slyness and gung-ho approach to experiments. Once you start writing the script and getting them talking to each other they really start to show their personalities to you. When the voices come and later the animation, then they become even more distinct.,Do you have a favourite between Max and Tangle?,Max is great because he’s up to no good and it’s fun to have a character like that. They create chaos. But if you were asking me who I’d rather have over to lunch, I think I’d go with Tangle to avoid Max’s life-threatening experiments.,Discover more about protons, quarks and particle physics in our

visited the Science Museum
just before Christmas to share some of the extraordinary stories from his new book,
An Astronaut’s Guide to Life on Earth
.,First selected as an astronaut in 1992, Chris has since served as CAPCOM for 25 Shuttle launches, Director of NASA Operations in Star City, Russia and as Chief of ISS Operations. Chris first flew into space in 1995, before returning in 2001 to help install Canadarm2 on the ISS. His final mission as an astronaut began in December 2012, culminating with his role as Commander of ISS Expedition 35.,During a tour of the
Exploring Space
gallery with Curator Doug Millard I asked what it felt like being an astronaut on board the ISS, ‘You are a representative of so many people’s hopes and dreams,’ Chris told me. ‘To be on board the ISS for five months is a gift of time.’,After pausing for photographs in front of the original
Apollo 10 Command Module
– which carried Tom Stafford, John Young and
Gene Cernan
back from the Moon in 1969 –
the conversation
turned to the future of space exploration. ‘The International Space Station currently is an extension of our self-awareness beyond Earth. One small step away from our own planet. The next logical step is to go the Moon. I am really hoping that within my lifetime we will start living on the Moon,’ explained Hadfield.,Arriving at the IMAX theatre, Chris shared stories from his new book and answered questions from the 400-strong audience about life as an astronaut, ‘My son sent me an email saying Mount Etna was erupting, so just like a dad on vacation I took a picture of Mount Etna.’,Some questions needed only a short answer, ‘Did I have a party when I can back to earth? Yes, several’ joked Chris. But others, such as describing a space walk, needed more explanation.,‘There’s a textured depth of darkness like you’ve never seen.  You are assaulted by the visual onslaught of this new place. I was stunned by the unexpected power of what was pouring in through my eyeballs’ explained Chris. ‘It would have been rude not to stop and look.’,Chris went on to describe how it felt with such a huge visual impact but no sound, ‘It’s like standing next to a waterfall and it being deadly silent.’,‘A spacewalk is one of the most powerful reminders of how alone you are. You are truly alone in the universe.’,Questions turned to what you do on the ISS in your spare time, ‘I wrote a whole album while up in space,’ answered Chris. He went on to discuss the human need to understand life through art, – from cave paintings in France to his own experiences recording the now famous
Space Oddity
video.,Many questions focused on our fascination with space and exploration. Chris said, ‘Space travel is nothing new. It’s a pattern we have been following for the last 70,000 years. There is a human necessity to leave home. That’s how we have spread across the whole planet. Each generation wants to see what’s beyond the horizon.’,The afternoon ended with questions about life as an astronaut. ‘Most of my time as an astronaut has been living on earth,’ explained Chris. ‘What you do in space may be entertaining, but it’s really not what matters. It’s life on earth that’s important.’,Did you join us for the book signing? Tell us more in the comments below."

It was found in the grave of a Peruvian child, and is thought to date from 1590-1610. Rubber balls were invented by the Ancient Mesoamericans who used them in what was probably the first ever ball sport, a game similar to racquetball called the
Mesoamerican Ballgame
. This game was invented around 1600 BC, but could be even older. In some places, instead of a rubber ball, they would use a human head!,Today we think of rubber balls as toys, but this one was most likely used as a funeral offering as a symbolic gesture towards the afterlife or perhaps even evidence of a human sacrifice to the gods.,Although this ball is only around 400 years old, it highlights just how long rubber has been used by humans. Incredibly, humans have been creating rubber for over 3500 years.,The first use of rubber was by the
Olmec
people (Rubber People) of South America. They would boil natural latex, a milky sap-like substance, which they ‘tapped’ from the rubber tree
Hevea Brasiliensis
, and mixed with the juice of a ‘morning glory’ vine. This created a very stretchy and extremely waterproof material. The Olmec’s used it to create items such as rubber balls, galoshes and waterproof cloaks.,Rubber wasn’t used greatly in the West until 1770 when an Englishman called
Joseph Priestly
, noticed that the material was very good at rubbing away pencil marks, hence the name ‘rubber’. Charles Mackintosh began using rubber to create his famous waterproof jackets in 1824. However, they were far from perfect as they melted in hot weather and smelled very bad!,Charles Goodyear and Thomas Hancock are responsible for producing the rubber we know today. In the 1840s they heated it in combination with sulphur to produce vulcanised rubber, strengthening it greatly. Thanks to the invention of the bicycle and motor car, rubber consumption soared as it was the perfect material for tyres, with its very durable and shock absorbent qualities.,The rubber ball can be found in

first launched
and demonstrated by Steve Jobs 30 years ago, on January 24 1984, in front of expectant audience of 3000 people. The Macintosh (there’s one from our collection pictured below) bears little resemble to those that are used today. A beige upright case housed a 9-inch black and white screen and had an in-built handle to easily transport its 7.5kg weight.,The Apple Macintosh was not the first of the Macintosh computers, but it was the first that was commercially successful. In comparison to previous models, it was considered to be relatively affordable at £1,840 and sold 70,000 in the first 5 months of sale. Prior to this, the Apple Lisa, targeted more at business users, was less affordable at £6,000 resulting in only around 6,500 being sold worldwide.,But it was not just the price that made this computer so popular. Firstly, it came complete with a
mouse
, which may seem an obvious counterpart to desktop computers we use today, but prior to this most computers had to rely on the keyboard entirely. In addition there was also 3.5” floppy disk drive which could manage 25% more data than discs used previously.,The biggest improvement came with the graphical user interface (GUI) which used square pixels instead of rectangular ones making the graphics much clearer and sharper. It also included icons of real-life items such as a ‘documents’ image and a ‘trash’ image instead of abstract text commands used previously.,These developments made the Macintosh an ideal personal computer for the majority of those that had no previous experience of computing, or as the advertising famously stated,

It was great to work with Heather at Riverside too, I learnt so much relating to Glasgow Museums’ collection. Overall it was an amazing experience, getting to know people from all over the UK and being able to visit the Science Museum.”
Elena,
Riverside Museum, Glasgow
.,“The most surprising thing I learned from the telegram collecting project was that about 100 years ago people used telegrams as we do use Email today: to let people know if they will be late, to order things, to make sure you get picked up from a train etc. It’s amazing how special and dear the telegrams are to the people who own them today, be it that they wrote or received them or inherited them, telegrams are a little treasure to the owners. I really enjoyed engaging in the people’s stories and lives, getting more curious and pulled into the story behind the telegram was my favourite part of the work on the project.”
Maja, Science Museum, London.,“The highs have been the excitement of the discoveries through the sheer colour and design of telegrams, the discoveries of stories which have touched the heart and which have international, national and local historical impacts. This has been an incredible journey. It has been a privilege to share in the life stories of others and be part of that sharing of these with a wider audience. I have taken away from this project the pleasure and privilege of being part of a Team. The project has given me the opportunity to develop my research skills and has reinforced for me the advantages gained from networking and collaborative work.”

last blog
post I’ve looked further into the box of papers on wireless I described in my first blog to find out about experimenter Hugh Ryan who was active from the early 1920s.,Hugh Ryan’s morse code test, essential to obtain a licence at the time, was arranged in August 1922.  He apparently passed because in November 1922 he demonstrated music and speech transmission, with reception at a church hall in Southfields.  “The use of such apparatus for amusement is irregular” wrote a GPO official, even though the demonstration was permitted.,In 1923 Hugh Ryan was perhaps pushing boundaries and as a consequence received a letter in July 1923 asking him to strictly observe the terms of the permit issued to his mother.,On 17 December 1923 he was granted special authority to take part in trans-atlantic tests and transmission was allowed for a maximum of 15 minutes a night.,However ahead of the trans-atlantic tests Hugh Ryan claimed to be the first amateur to make radio contact with the USA after he exchanged calls with 8AJW, on 2 Dec 1923 according to several cards in the box.,Ryan was editor of publication
EW&WE
(Experimental Wireless and Wireless Engineer) and in that capacity received postal reception reports ( also known as DX reports) from experimenters.  Many reception reports were addressed to Hugh Ryan by his callsign 5BV, which was expressed internationally as British 5BV or G5BV.  The reports came from experimenters in many countries and included technical details and speculation with evidence on factors affecting radio propagation such as time of day, moon phase, barometric pressure, weather conditions, aerial type and even polar lights.  A source of echo was speculated as signals taking two paths round the earth.  These reports read as examples of citizen science.  One experimenter reported on experiments with low power.,To quote a few examples from the reception reports.  An experimenter in a letter dated 3 April 1926 mentions “…we are getting some useful data on conditions as we transmit at various times of the day and night and it does seem that on sunny days the fading is a lot worse than any other time…”.  In a letter of 3 Feb 1926 from Copenhagen in the context of transmissions from boat SS Island the writer reports “one night where polar lights completely caused the signals [from SS Island to Copenhagen] to fade out”.  A letter of July 1925 reports a record, the first reception in England of a South African station.,One experimenter mentions conducting reports into fading for the Radio Research Board, perhaps this was an example of citizen science overlapping with official research.  What became of
EW&WE
is not recorded in the papers in the box, but Hugh Ryan kept up his enthusiasm for radio and was still licensed as a radio amateur as late as 1965.,Geoff Chapman is a Science Museum volunteer who catalogued a box of amateur radio materials for our exciting new gallery

The crucial advantage humans had over Neanderthals was sewing,Human needles made from bone have been unearthed but never a Neanderthal needle.

Slime moulds have 13 sexes,No one knows why. But, then, nobody is sure why there is sex. The best bet, however, is that it evolved to outsmart parasites. Parents, by shuffling together their genes, continually create novel offspring to which parasites are not adapted.,4.
You age more quickly on the top floor of a building than the ground floor,This is an effect of Einstein’s theory of gravity, which predicts that time flows more slowly in strong gravity. On the ground floor of a building, you are closer to the mass of the Earth so gravity is marginally stronger and time flows marginally more slowly (If you want to live longer – move to a bungalow!),5.
J. J. Thomson
got the Nobel prize for showing that an electron is a particle. His son got it for showing that
it isn’t,,The ultimate building blocks of matter – atoms, electrons and so on – have a strange dual nature, behaving simultaneously like tiny, localised billiard balls and spread-out waves. The truth is they are neither particles nor waves but something for which we have no word in our vocabulary and no analogy in the familiar, everyday world.,6.
You are 95% alien,That’s right. 95% of the cells in your body do not belong to you. They are microorganisms hitching a ride. Many are essential like the gut bacteria that help you digest your food. You get all the alien microorganism only after you are born – from your mother’s milk and the environment. You are born 100% human but die 95% alien!,7.
Brains are so energy hungry most organisms on Earth do without them,The best illustration of this comes from the juvenile sea squirt. It swims through the ocean looking for a rock to cling to and make its home. When it finds one, it no longer needs its brain so it… eats it!,8.
Babies are powered by rocket fuel,Rockets combine liquid oxygen with liquid hydrogen to make water. This liberates just about the most energy, pound for pound, of any common chemical reaction. Babies – and in fact all of us – do the same. We combine oxygen from the air with hydrogen stripped from our food. The energy liberated drives all the biological processes in our bodies.,9.
There was no improvement in the design of stone hand axes for 1.4 million years,Palaeoanthropologists call it the ‘1.4 million years of boredom’. It could be of course that our ancestors made tools from wood, which decayed, or from bone, which are impossible to distinguish from natural bones. And, just because tools did not change, does not mean nothing was happening. All kinds of things that left no record may have been going on such as the taming of fire and the invention of language.,10.
98% of the Universe is invisible,Only 4 per cent of the mass of the Universe is made of atoms – the kind of stuff, you, me, the stars and planets are made of – and we have seen only half of that with our telescopes. 23% of the Universe is invisible, or “dark”, matter, whose existence we know of because it tugs with its gravity on the visible stuff. And 73% is dark energy, which is invisible, fills all of space and has repulsive gravity which is speeding up the expansion of the Universe. If you can find out what the dark matter or dark energy is, there is a Nobel prize waiting for you!,Find out more at this month’s

Information Age
,
which celebrates the history of information and communication technologies, is due to open at the Science Museum.,The gallery will include some truly fascinating objects such as the 2LO transmitter, part of the Enfield telephone Exchange and the impressive Rugby Tuning Coil. As well as these large scale objects, the exhibition will house smaller objects such as a Baudot Keyboard, a Crystal Radio Set, and a Morse Tapper.,Information Age
will also contain a host of digital technology and interactive displays where visitors will be able to explore the stories behind the objects and the themes of the exhibition in more detail.,This is where we come in.,As Audience Researchers, it is our job to make sure that visitors can use and engage with the digital displays in this gallery whilst also ensuring that they don’t draw attention away from the objects and the stories they tell.,We do this by testing prototypes of the interactive exhibits, games, web resources and apps with visitors both in the museum and through focus groups. There are three stages in the prototyping process. We begin by showing people a ‘mock up’ of a resource so that we can get feedback on our initial ideas. This can be very basic, for example we have been testing for
Information Age
with storyboards on paper, handmade models (which have sometimes fallen apart during the testing process!) and computers.,We invite visitors to try these prototypes while we observe and make notes and then we interview them afterwards. This helps us to understand what people think about our ideas, whether people find the resources usable and whether the stories we want to tell are being conveyed effectively. We then discuss our findings with the Exhibition team who are then able to further develop their ideas. The resources are tested a second and third time using the same process to ensure that the final experience is interesting, fun and engaging.,As well as testing these resources in a special prototyping room we also test some of the experiences in the
museum galleries
to see how visitors react to them in a more realistic setting.,Recently we have been prototyping electro-mechanical interactive models of some of the smaller objects that will be on display in
Information Age
. These exhibits intend to give visitors an insight into what it would have been like to use these objects whilst explaining the scientific processes behind how they work.,We will be testing different digital experiences until September, so you may see us in the prototyping room or the galleries. If you see us feel free to say hello and ask us any questions.,Experience these interactive models for yourself in the new

blogs on interviewing Peter Higgs for the
new series of
The Life Scientific
on BBC Radio 4. Discover more about the LHC, particle physics and the search for the Higgs boson in our
Collider exhibition
.,I love name dropping about some of the science superstars I’ve interviewed on
The Life Scientific
. “
Richard Dawkins was quite charming on the programme
, you know”, or “
James Lovelock
is as sharp as ever”, and so on. So imagine my excitement when I heard I would be interviewing the ultimate science celebrity
Peter Higgs
.,When I discovered we had secured him for the first programme in the new 2014 series, I knew I had to get something more out of him than to simply regurgitate the
popular account of the man as shy, modest and unassuming
, and still awkward about having a fundamental particle named after him; or how
the Nobel committee were unable to get hold of him on the day of the announcement
because he had obliviously wandered off to have lunch with friends.,This was an opportunity for two theoretical physicists – OK, one who has a Nobel Prize to his name and
one who doesn’t
, but let’s not split hairs here – to chat about the thrill of discovery and to peek into the workings of nature, whilst the outside world listened in.,You can
listen to the programme from 18 February
, but here are a few extracts to whet your appetite.,Can you explain the Higgs mechanism in 30 seconds?,At some point in the programme, inevitably, I had to ask Peter to explain the
Higgs mechanism
and
Higgs field
(both more fundamental concepts than the
Higgs boson
). He gave a beautifully articulate and clear explanation, but I then thought I should ask him to give the ‘idiot’s guide to the Higgs’, just to cover all bases. Here’s how that went:,,‘The Boson that Bears my Name’,Working alone in Edinburgh in the sixties, Peter Higgs was considered ‘a bit of a crank’. “No-one wanted to work with me”, he says. In 1964, he predicted the possible existence of a new kind of boson, but at the time there was little interest in this now much-celebrated insight. And in the years that followed, Peter Higgs himself failed to realise the full significance of his theory, which would later transform particle physics.,,In July 2012, scientists at the
Large Hadron Collider at CERN
confirmed that the Higgs boson had indeed been found and Peter Higgs shot to fame. This ephemeral speck of elusive energy is now the subject of car adverts, countless jokes,
museum exhibitions
and even a
song by Nick Cave called the Higgs Boson Blues
. But Higgs has always called it the scalar boson or, jokingly, ‘the boson that bears my name’ and remains genuinely embarrassed that it is named after him alone.,In fact, three different research groups, working independently, published very similar papers in 1964 describing what’s now known as the Higgs mechanism. And Higgs told me he’s surprised that another British physicist,
Tom Kibble
from Imperial College, London didn’t share the 2013 Nobel Prize for Physics, along with him and
Belgian physicist, Francois Englert
.,On fame
When the 2013 Nobel Prize winners were announced, Peter was famously elusive (much to the frustration of the world’s media). Most people romanticised that he was blissfully unaware of all the fuss or just not that interested. These days, he’s constantly being stopped in the street and asked for autographs, so I asked him whether he enjoyed being famous:,,Physics post-Higgs
With the discovery of the Higgs finally ticked off our to-do list, attention is turning to the next challenge: to find a new family of particles predicted by our current front-runner theory, called supersymmetry. Higgs would ‘like this theory to be right’ because it is the only way theorists have at the moment of incorporating the force of gravity into the grand scheme of things.,But what if the Large Hadron Collider doesn’t reveal any new particles? Will we have to build an even bigger machine that smashes subatomic particles together with ever-greater energy? In fact, Peter Higgs believes that the next big breakthrough may well come from a different direction altogether, for example by studying the
behaviour of neutrinos
, the elusive particles believed the be the most common in the Universe, which, as Higgs admits, “is not the sort of thing the Large Hadron Collider is good for”.,When it started up in 2008, physicists would not have dreamt of asking for anything bigger than the Large Hadron Colider. But today one hears serious talk of designing a machine that might one day succeed it. One candidate is the somewhat unimaginatively named Very Large Hadron Collider. Such a machine would dwarf the Large Hadron Collider. It would collide protons at seven times higher energy than the maximum the Large Hadron Collider is able to reach. And it would require a tunnel 100 km in circumference. Of course this is not the only proposal on the table and there are plenty of other ideas floating about – none of which come cheap, naturally.,There are certainly plenty more deep mysteries to solve, from the nature of
dark matter
and dark energy to
where all the antimatter has gone
, and we will undoubtedly find the answers (oh, the delicious arrogance of science). Let’s just hope we don’t have to wait as long as Peter Higgs did.,Keen to discover more? You can listen to Peter Higgs on BBC Radio 4’s

Information Age
gallery.,As a Collections Assistant working on the new
Information Age
gallery my role means I work with the objects through each stage of their journey – from storage to display. At the moment I spend my day working in the stores, where each object must be checked for any potential hazards (such as lead or mercury), handled, and moved for conservation. With so many objects to keep track of a lot of time is spent planning conservation and logistics schedules, and making sure every object is accurately documented and well cared for in storage.,With over 800 objects to conserve, pack, transport and install, this is certainly no mean feat. The team is divided across two sites, with three Conservators based at our store for large objects in Wroughton and three Conservators, two Collections Assistants and one Conservation Student based at
Blythe House
in West London.,Blythe House, formerly the headquarters of the Post Office Savings Bank and built between 1899 and 1903, is now a museum storage facility and home to the Science Museum’s incredible collection of small to medium sized objects. There are over 203,000 objects stored over 90 rooms at Blythe House, with extensive and diverse collections ranging from the History of Medicine to Telecommunications.,The Conservators work meticulously on each object in our Conservation Laboratory, carrying out research and treatments, and documenting every object in great detail. The Conservators also advise on the best way to display the objects, ensuring the objects will be safe, secure and stable when in the gallery and that they are protected for the future.,While each Information Age object will go through the same thorough process, every day is different for the team at Blythe House. Whether it is co-ordinating the move of larger and more challenging objects, taking part in public events, providing tours, couriering loans, or planning for the arrival of new acquisitions, there is never a dull moment in the stores.,With the opening of the
Information Age
gallery planned for later this year, we will soon be reaching the final stages of object conservation. Before long we’ll be packing and transporting the objects to the
Science Museum
where we will all be on hand to install the objects in the new gallery."

, a
Research Assistant working at the Centre of Human and Aerospace Physiological Sciences (
CHAPS
), talks about her career in space science for our
Beyond Earth
festival this weekend.,My name is Julia Attias and I’m a space physiologist. What does that mean? “Physiology” generally refers to the functions and processes of the human body. Space physiology involves the understanding of how the body functions in
space
, and particularly in an environment that has far less gravity than on Earth. It’s important to know how low gravity environments affect people taking part in space missions.,I became a space physiologist through completing a Masters degree in Space Physiology and Health at Kings College London in September 2012. The course is designed to help us understand the challenges that an
astronaut’s body
faces both in space and on return to Earth, such as muscle and bone loss, weakening of the cardiovascular system and visual disturbances.,During my masters dissertation, I started to research the “Gravity-Loading Countermeasure Skinsuit” (GLCS), funded by the European Space Agency (
ESA
). The Skinsuit was designed by a group of aerospace engineers at MIT, with the aim to recreate the same force that the body experiences through Earth’s natural gravitational pull. This way, if the Skinsuit is worn in environments of zero-gravity, the body should be protected from some of the issues mentioned above.,I’ve been studying the Skinsuit to see if it really does produce a gravity load similar to Earth’s, and if it could be used in the future alongside exercise activities to keep astronauts fit and keep their heart, muscles and bones strong in space.,Space travel is becoming of increasing interest in the UK, primarily owing to British astronaut
Tim Peake
, who will be flying to the
International Space Station
in 2015! During the next year, there will be many discussions about how to keep him healthy while in space.,I’ll be starting a PhD in October 2014 which will involve continuing my research with the Skinsuit to see how it might help tackle issues such as back pain and spinal elongation. This research will combine with other work conducted all over the globe to help keep astronauts like Tim Peake as free of physiological burden as possible for their return to Earth.,Unfortunately I won’t be at the
Beyond Earth
festival this weekend, because I’ll be testing the Skinsuit with ESA astronaut Thomas Pesquet!  We’ll be testing the Skinsuit in a weightless environment (not in space unfortunately!) through a parabolic flight. We will get into an aircraft which descends rapidly, creating up to 22 seconds of weightlessness at a time – it’s a bit like being on a roller coaster. The flight is to test the Skinsuit in a weightless environment – taking off and putting on the suit to ensure the simple things we take for granted on Earth are possible in zero-gravity!"

Big Science
, a recent discussion about science and society since WWII that was part of our
Collider
events series.,,If you want to get an understanding of giant scientific projects like CERN, go into your kitchen and take your microwave apart. Actually don’t – we recommend that you leave potentially-destructive household experiments to the guidance of
Punk Science
. But as
Jon Agar
points out, a household device that we now take for granted contains a component that is a signature of the sciences since WW2. The magnetron – which generates the short-wavelength radio waves (or ‘microwaves’) to heat up your dinner – was crucial in the development of airborne radar for WW2.,While the names usually associated with the invention are those of University of Birmingham scientists John Randall and Harry Boot, they were not stereotypical lone geniuses in a laboratory: Randall was employed by General Electric, and the research was sponsored by the Admiralty with the aim of detecting submarines. This interplay between academic, industrial and military interests is often characteristic of Big Science – a broad term which historians use to describe the large-scale projects of the sciences of the late 20
th
century.,Last week’s
conversation
between Jon and
Lisa Jardine,
held in our
Collider exhibition
, discussed several examples of Big Science, and ways of making sense of it. One handy mnemonic is the Five M’s: money; manpower; big machines; military interests and media attention – although CERN,
which celebrates its 60
th
birthday this year
, is a notable exception to the ‘military’ rule. It was founded with the aim of using peaceful scientific research to knit Europe together again after the war. Find out more
here
.,This pan-European institution preceded later economic and political unions, although over the past 60 years particle physics has also witnessed Britain’s ambiguity about being part of Europe. Immediately after WW2 Britain was one of the few European nations that didn’t need a joint accelerator, as it already had its own large facilities, and there was much discussion before signing the CERN convention. Although UK universities and industrial partners were
major players in building the Large Hadron Collider
, they might not have been involved at all. Jon showed us a 1984 letter, preserved in the National Archives, in which Margaret Thatcher –
who trained as a scientist
– expresses doubt about ‘extravagant’ collaborative projects. Mrs T was eventually convinced of the worth of keeping the UK in CERN, and was even partly responsible for one of the most common
analogies used to explain the Higgs boson.
(Mind you, Peter Higgs himself admits that it’s pretty impossible to explain the mechanism simply, in this
interview with Jim Al-Khalili
).,And sometimes exploring Big Science involves looking at the little things: Lisa says that one of the best ways to understand how our lives are intertwined with science is to explore how science is intertwined with life. Big Science provides plenty of opportunities to explore social interaction amongst large groups, whether it’s the staggering 75,000 people working at the Manhattan Project’s Oak Ridge site as development of the atomic bomb neared completion (see an exhibition of the official photographer’s work
here
) or the 3,000 people onsite at CERN at any given time. We’ve tried to recreate some of CERN’s everyday scenes in
Collider
, which runs at the Science Museum until 5 May and then at the
Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester
from 23 May – 28 September.,The audio recording of Lisa and Jon’s wide-ranging conversation can be listened to

Nissen Richards Studio
to talk about her team’s work on our
Collider
exhibition.,Can you tell our readers a little about NISSEN RICHARDS studio and the kinds of projects you work on?,We are a bit unusual as a design practice as we work in different sectors; architecture, theatre and exhibition. We love the way that they have slightly different rhythms and processes that all feed on each other. Exhibition design sits nicely between architecture and theatre; it’s about the space and form of different spaces (architecture), but ultimately is about a visitor experience in a timeline across these (theatre).,You went out to CERN several times for the Collider exhibition, what was your impression of the place?,We were completely bowled over by
CERN
– it was extraordinary as well as full of the ordinary. The sheer size and aesthetic was beautiful – both above ground and below. In the corridors and the warehouses that you arrive in – it felt as if everything was frozen in time from somewhere around 1970 with an austere and functional Swiss graphic language thrown in.,Below ground was like a science fiction film, or being in a giant Ferrari engine – stunningly beautiful and utterly functional.,We also loved the fact that people led normal lives that went on while they were working on such mind-blowing things; and how these clashed unexpectedly. One scientist for example had his kitchen organised so that he could still see the operational screens of CERN – so he could be eating breakfast, helping his children with their homework and watching a collision happening.,The humanness of the spaces also shone through – funny posters about the CERN lifestyle (dancing and singing clubs etc) or jokes pinned up next to an equation and technical drawing of the tunnel – how CERN was filled by thousands of people doing their job – all contributing to something cutting edge and important.,We were particularly taken for example by a scribbled note on a wipe board in the control room saying ‘Don’t forget to reset the undulators!’ next to a comic-book style joke cut out from a magazine about scientists.,What approach did you take in the exhibition design?,We had this amazing experience at CERN, being shown around by extraordinary scientists that were passionate about their work but incredibly friendly and clear in their explanations.,We had a real sense of this being a place where everyone was involved for the good of it all – at the forefront of science – like travelling in space, not knowing exactly what they were about to discover, which was incredibly exciting.,It was full of different people, of different nationalities, with conversations moving freely from English to French to Italian etc. It felt like a truly collaborative and non-hierarchical place.,That is what we wanted to capture – and we decided to base the experience for the visitor to the museum on the same idea – as if you were gaining access to these wonderful people and spaces that few get to see.,As a piece of design, I really enjoy the spatial rhythm of
the exhibition
; it takes you around the exhibition and helps you in what to look at, giving you clues and gestures, how spaces vary and change as you go through.,I also love the graphic language developed by both
Finn Ross
the video designer (see more of Finn’s photos from his visit to CERN
here
), and
Northover & Brown
the 2D designers, which supplements our designs – adding a level of detail in a bold and photographic but abstract way: how the beam of the Collider becomes a character in your journey as a visitor.,There was a very diverse team working on Collider, including people from the worlds of theatre, design, museums and science. What was the development process like?,The “diverse-ness” of the team was hugely enjoyable but also a great challenge. If everyone in the team had been in one room, it could have been quite overwhelming.,There were video designers, lighting designer, sound designer, playwright, costume designers, and actors and there were also other consultants such as graphic designers, conservators, security experts, quantity surveyors, project managers, and of course the scientists and people from CERN.,To find a clear voice we decided to work through workshops; something that we have done before especially in the theatre where we work with many different artists.,This was a very enjoyable process – we would all be together in a room, brainstorm and slowly plot out the visitors’ journey as if we were making a film. We used flipcharts, models, photos, text, films etc that we pinned all round the rooms of various parts of the Science Museum.,Are there any particular highlights during the design process that stand out?,There are so many wonderful moments. But to pick a few; setting up a green screen in the Science Museum while Brian Cox made his cameo; going to the stunning underground spaces of the detectors and filming; and workshop-ing with our playwright and actors in a small rehearsal space in Whitechapel. We all realised that we were creating something quite special.,What has the reaction to the exhibition been?,The day after the exhibition opened we were on tenterhooks and rather perfectly, the
Independent
Newspaper ran a front-page story with a large picture of Peter Higgs with the headline “Intelligent design: ‘God Particle’ theorist opens sublime exhibition”.,I went straight from the newsagent to the framers and now it has pride of place in our studio. The reaction from the press has been very positive with 5* reviews.,But our greatest praise is from visitors who say that they feel as if they have taken a trip to CERN, and understand both what the people are like, and a bit more about the science behind it.,Are there any other exhibitions/projects that inspired your work on Collider?,It is interesting that the work we talked about the most when making Collider – were theatre projects that we had worked on or we had visited. Ones where the audience moves around between events and their journey is tailored and twisted by using actors, musicians, video, props, and installations.,We have worked on a couple of these kinds of projects for Aldeburgh Festival. On “
The Way to the Sea
” we took over a village in Suffolk for a week, and staged two musical performances in different locations, while a 500 strong audience walked between locations coming across signs, poetry, actors, props, speakers, and installations.,My most memorable type of exhibition event that sticks in my mind and inspired me to study theatre design in the first place is over 20 years ago in the Clink (before it was developed). The artist Robert Wilson worked with a sound designer to create a series of stories that you wandered through as a visitor, each like exquisite tableau.,There were a series of these kind of events in the late 80’s early 90’s and I spent my student years assisting Hildegard Bechtler on a few of her pioneering projects, where she took over buildings to subvert the theatre and create more of a total experience for the audience from the moment they entered the theatre building. It is tremendously exciting to use this in exhibition design years later.,Do you think that the mixture of theatre and exhibition works?,I think that it really works, and for me it is about helping the visitor engage with the content of exhibitions. In a theatrical setting people can have an emotional sensorial connection – through sound, smell, touch – and once engaged they can spend time to understand and interpret the meaning of the objects or artefacts.,I feel that there is a lot of scope in this – and exhibitions are becoming different to what they used to be. It is now not enough to put some objects in a showcase and write a label – I learn from my own children that they often feel like they need a way in when visiting museums.,Ultimately it is all about the objects as they are the authentic elements. However we can help with giving them meaning through designing people’s experience.,We will continue to use elements of theatre in our work, and enjoy the relationship between what is real with its own set of history, and what we are adding to allow you in.,The Collider exhibition runs at the Science Museum until 5 May 2014 (tickets can be booked
here
). The exhibition will then open at the
Museum of Science and Industry
in Manchester from May 23 – September 28 2014 (tickets available soon

new exhibition
on James Lovelock opens, his daughter Christine recalls her science-filled childhood and the night they sat up waiting for a comet to destroy the Earth.,When I was a child my father took us to the Science Museum in London. His favourite exhibit was the Newcomen steam engine, built in the early 18th century to pump water from mines. He told us how much the museum had inspired him when
he
was a child. Science had become the
abiding passion
of his life, and as we grew up it was the background to ours as well.,We lived for a while at the
Common Cold Research Unit
, where my father worked, at
Harvard Hospital
near Salisbury in Wiltshire, and even became part of the research. Whenever we caught a cold the scientists put on parties for us where we would pass on our germs, as well as parcels, to the volunteers who lived in the isolation huts.,My strongest memories of my father during this period are the conversations we had about scientific ideas, whether on country walks or at the dining table. We often had fun working out plots for stories, including one he helped me to write about some
fossil hunters
on a Dorset beach who stumbled on a fossilised radio set – with shocking implications for the established science of geology.,When we moved back to Wiltshire, he turned
Clovers Cottage
into the world’s only thatched space laboratory. It was full of interesting equipment, much of it home-made, including an electric Bunsen burner. The cottage used to have a skull and crossbones in the window, with the warning “Danger Radioactivity!” My father always said this was a good way to deter burglars.,One evening in the 1960s, my father arrived home from a trip to
Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory
in California with some frightening news. A comet had been spotted that was expected to hit Earth that night. The Nasa astronomers back then didn’t have today’s computer technology and said there had been no time to go public with the news.,My father wasn’t worried about the potential disaster. His reaction was a mixture of apprehension, curiosity and excitement. As he said, “If it hits us and it’s the end of the world, we won’t know anything about it, but if there is a near miss, then we might see some amazing fireworks.” While the rest of Britain slept a peaceful sleep, we packed up the car and drove to the highest hill nearby.,I’ll always remember that night, when we snuggled under blankets in the darkness, waiting and watching for what might have been the
end of the world
. It didn’t happen, of course. The astronomers got it wrong, as my father expected they would, but in an odd – and unscientific – way we felt we had done our bit to keep the Earth safe.,As I grew older I began to help my father more with his work. One day I will never forget is when we went up
Hungry Hill
on the Beara Peninsula in Ireland in 1969. Our mission was to collect samples of the cleanest air in Europe, blowing straight off the Atlantic. My father then drove straight on to Shannon Airport, and flew with the samples to the United States.,On arrival, a customs officer thought my father was being facetious when he said the flasks contained “fresh Irish air”. An argument ensued in which the official demanded that the flasks be opened, which would have made the whole journey pointless. Fortunately, sense prevailed and the samples reached their destination safely.,Christine Lovelock

Harry Cliff
, Curator of our
Collider
exhibition
and the first Science Museum Fellow of Modern Science explores one of the most important discoveries of a generation.,In what has been hailed as one of the most important discoveries of a generation, astronomers working on the
BICEP2 telescope
at the South Pole have announced that they have detected gravitational tremors from the birth of our Universe imprinted across the sky. The result is the first direct evidence for inflation, the theory that the Universe expanded unimaginably fast, an infinitesimal instant after time zero.,The
theory of inflation
states that the Universe grew in volume by about a factor of at least 10
78
, a number so vast that it’s impossible to comprehend (its roughly equal to the number of atoms in the universe). This phenomenal expansion took place in an incredibly short time, in about ten billionths of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second, at a time when the Universe was cold, dark and empty. To put this in context, if the full stop at the end of this sentence were to grow by the same factor, it would end up about a hundred times larger than our galaxy.,Inflation is a crucial part of modern cosmological theories and solves many serious problems with the traditional Big Bang model, but so far there has been no direct evidence that it actually happened. However, inflationary theories predict that this violent expansion would have created ripples in space and time known as gravitational waves. These ripples would then have echoed through the cosmos, leaving a mark on the oldest light in the Universe, the Cosmic Microwave Background (
CMB
).,Discovered fifty years ago by the American radio astronomers Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson (who at first mistook it for pigeon poo in their receiver), the CMB is the remnant of the light emitted 380,000 years after the Big Bang, when the Universe cooled enough for atoms to form and for light to travel freely across space. The discovery of the CMB was one of the most important events in the history of science, providing convincing evidence that the Universe began in a violent hot expansion known as the Big Bang. This ancient light has been stretched from a searing hot 3000 Kelvin to a freezing 2.7 Kelvin by the expansion of space, leaving it as a faint microwave signal coming from the entire sky.,The BICEP2 telescope is based at the Amundsen-Scott station at the geographic South Pole, where temperatures plummet to below minus 70 degrees Celsius in the Antarctic winter and the base is buffeted by blizzards and gale force winds. Despite these incredibly hostile conditions, the BICEP2 telescope is in the perfect location to study the CMB.,The South Pole is around 3000 metres above sea level, and the driest place on Earth, meaning that there is relatively little atmospheric water vapour that would otherwise screen out the CMB signal. This comes with the added advantage that BICEP2 is able to scan the same small piece of sky all year round, by effectively looking straight down from the bottom of the planet to the point known as the celestial south pole.,BICEP2 astronomers spent almost three years scanning the CMB in incredible detail, but yesterday the freezing conditions and hard work paid off spectacularly as they revealed subtle twists in the CMB, a smoking gun for gravitational waves from inflation. In fact, the BICEP2 astronomers were surprised by just how strong the signal was. “This has been like looking for a needle in a haystack, but instead we found a crowbar,” said co-leader Clem Pryke.,Although the result hasn’t been peer reviewed or published in a scientific journal yet, most astronomers agree that the findings look solid. The fifty-strong BICEP2 team have been sitting on their historic result since the end of 2012, and have spent more than a year checking and rechecking to ensure they have taken account of every possible effect, from gravitational lensing to space dust, which might have given a false result.,So what does this mean for our understanding of our Universe? The BICEP2 result is really three
Nobel Prize
-worthy discoveries in one. They have found the first convincing evidence that inflation really happened, giving science its first glimpse of the moment in which the universe came into being. Second, they have found the strongest evidence yet for gravitational waves, the last prediction of Einstein’s theory of general relativity to be verified, and something that astronomers have been searching for for decades. Third, and by no means least, this discovery demonstrates a deep connection between quantum mechanics and gravity, giving hope that we may one day find evidence of a theory of everything, a theory that would unite our theory of particles and forces with our theory of cosmology and gravity. This would undoubtedly be the greatest prize in science.,If confirmed by other observatories, this incredible result will go down in history as one of the most important scientific discoveries of the 21
st
century, eclipsing even CERN’s discovery of the
Higgs boson in 2012
. Nobel Prizes will almost certainly follow. More importantly, this result opens up a new window through which astronomers and cosmologists may, for the first time, glimpse the very moment of creation.,Explore more about astronomy in our

Cosmonauts: Birth of the Space Age
will bring together many unique artifacts that have never before been seen outside Russia, exploring some of the most remarkable and important stories from the dawn of the space age to Russia’s present leading role in space science and exploration.,Telling the story of the Cosmonauts is an important reminder of the remarkable achievements made by humans in little more than a century of scientific experimentation, cosmic speculation and daring risks. For someone of my generation, these achievements are regarded as an everyday reality. Humans now maintain a permanent presence, living and working in orbit, and so far over 500 international citizens have traveled to space, including cosmonauts, astronauts, taikonauts, as well as engineers, doctors, biologists, teachers, politicians, and even tourists. Every one of these space travelers owe their experience to the early work of the Russian Cosmonauts, and perhaps to one special pilot in particular.,53 years ago, on this day, April 12
th
, 1961, the Soviet pilot Yuri Gagarin inaugurated the era of manned spaceflight when he travelled into outer space in a rocket, completing a single orbit around the Earth in 108 minutes.,Gagarin had been especially chosen from a group of 20 Russian pilots to be the world’s first cosmonaut. The decision was highly symbolic and political, and Gagarin’s working class upbringing and photogenic smile were just as important as his ability to withstand the extreme conditions of spaceflight.,He was 27 years old the day of his legendary flight, dressed in a bright orange spacesuit and a helmet inscribed with ‘CCCP’ painted in red. The painted letters were a last minute addition, marking Gagarin as a Soviet citizen so that he would be recognized when found on his return.,He took off with the words ‘Poyehali!’ (Let’s go!).,Gagarin’s rocket was an adapted missile, called R-7 or ‘Semyorka’. The rocket carried his ‘Vostok’ spacecraft, which translates as ‘East’ in Russian. Vostok included a ball-shaped descent module – nicknamed the ‘tin can’, which Gagarin was strapped into and then shot into orbit like a cannon. With the passing years it seems astounding that such a seemingly rudimentary vessel enabled the first man to go to space.,As the news of the launch spread, people poured into the streets to celebrate the epic moment. My parents, who were children in the Soviet Union at the time of the launch, remember the day with great clarity. My mother recalls that the moment the news was announced people jumped to their feet and began to run. ‘Everyone was running and screaming, “We are flying!”’,In a way, the Soviet Union’s achievement turned fantasy into reality, for a moment transcending both the Earth’s atmosphere and the Cold War political climate of the era. Watching the cloud forms through his window, Gagarin told his ground control unit how beautiful the Earth looked.,Despite the worldwide attention, Gagarin’s flight had been shrouded in secrecy, especially his landing, the details of which were not released until the 1970’s. Most of the world was told that Gagarin was inside Vostok-1 in a complete process from take-off to landing. In fact, he came down by parachute separate from the descent module, landing safely on his feet. He famously greeted the first people he encountered with:,‘I am a friend, comrades, a friend.’,Gagarin returned to Moscow as a worldwide celebrity. Everybody wanted to hear what he had seen and felt. Invitations from many countries of the world began to pour in. Gagarin toured the world, always being welcomed with lavish parades and gifts. Along with his personal reputation, the event was commemorated by a myriad of monuments, art works, images, symbols, books, and memorabilia, which proliferated well beyond the Soviet Union. Some of those objects will be displayed in our
Cosmonauts
exhibition.,Ever since 12 April 1961, the anniversary of Gagarin’s first flight has been celebrated in Russia and the former USSR countries as a holiday known as Cosmonautics Day. More recently the anniversary has been declared the International Day of Human Space Flight. The festivities are varied. A traditional ceremony takes place yearly in Russia, but new celebrations are still being imagined. A global event called Yuri’s Night has been organized since 2001 through social media. Such events are organized by people all over the world and include all night raves, film screenings, and other events to mark the occasion of the first human spaceflight.  However you choose to mark the occasion, this anniversary holds a profound meaning for all of us: it is a celebration of peace, cultural cooperation, and most importantly the idea that people can achieve extraordinary things.,Discover the dramatic history of the Russian space programme in our new exhibition,

Information Age
, a brand new gallery about the last 200 years of communication and information technology, opening this autumn.,There are a huge range of exciting objects being prepared for the Information Age gallery. As one of the six conservators working on the project, I have the privilege of cleaning, documenting and repairing the objects before they go on public display. My favourite object is the Super Selector Radio Receiver, made around 1927 in London by Selectors Limited.,The Super Selector appeals to me because of its interesting shape and design – it looks more like a piece of furniture than a modern radio set. The radio has attracted lots of attention, although because of its size and shape it is commonly mistaken for a wooden PC computer.,The first challenge of working with this radio, was moving it from the storage rooms to the conservation lab at the Museum.  Although it is called “super portable”, it weighs about ten kilos and is certainly not super portable by today’s standards, weighing one hundred times more than an average MP3 player.,When the object arrived at the Museum, there were several areas of damage that needed to be documented and repaired before it could go on display. The main areas of concern were the leather handle, which was powdery and weakened and the textile speaker which was torn with sections of missing fabric.  The object needed to be documented, cleaned, repaired and then documented again to record the changes it went through during conservation.,After inspecting the exterior of the radio I began to look inside. Luckily, there were two keys with the radio set which allowed us access to the fascinating mechanisms inside.  Inside the radio, some of the most attractive components are the glass valves.  The valves are potentially dangerous if broken as this may cause flying glass, so one of my first tasks, after cleaning the radio, was to pack the valves with tissue to prevent any breakages.  After packing the valves, the conservation treatment of the radio receiver involved more cleaning, securing the handle and repairing the textile speaker.,The silk speaker posed the biggest challenge in terms of repair, but after consulting a specialist textile conservator at the
National Maritime Museum
I decided to cover the fragile silk with toned patches of special conservation silk. I cut the patches to shape, coloured them so that they matched the green colour on the speaker and carefully attached the patches to the speaker frame.  This technique prevents further damage to the object from light, physical damage and dust.,The Super Selector radio receiver was a fascinating object to work with and despite the challenges involved, I believe the radio will stay in good condition for visitors to enjoy in the Information Age gallery for many years to come."

.,Fifty years ago today, the very first episode of
Horizon
, the BBC science programme, hit the airwaves. Two and a half minutes into The World of Buckminster Fuller, the voiceover announces the aim of the series: ‘Horizon aims to present science as an essential part of our twentieth century culture, a continuing growth of thought that cannot be subdivided’.,Behind that confident statement lay 17 months of detailed discussions between a close knit group of TV producers and science writers. They had set themselves a hard task: to produce a new kind of science television programme. And there had been plenty of science on screen in the previous 15 postwar years of British TV.,So they resolutely turned away from the style of earlier programmes such as Science is News or Eye on Researchand set out to copy the era’s most successful and popular arts magazine series, Monitor. In copying this, the production team determined to make a programme that was focussed on the culture, ideas and personalities of science. They rejected being driven by the news agenda and they refused to simply teach the content of science.,In the five decades since, more than 1100 programmes have been broadcast. The producers have always seen themselves as televisual journalists, ever in search of the good science story. Some of the programmes have had major impact. For example, Alec Nisbett’s
Killer in the Village
(1983) brought AIDS to the attention of the world, and
Now the Chips are Down
(Edward Goldwyn, 1978) revealed the information revolution to come.,There is a long association between the
Science Museum
and Horizon. In the first Christmas special in 1964, Science, Toys and Magic (Ramsay Short), featured the Museum’s then science lecturer John van Riemsdijk demonstrating antique scientific toys.,Until recently, most of
Horizon
’s programmes and history have remained in the vault. But now, as the fruit of a
50th anniversary collaboration
between BBC History and the Science Museum, 17 former editors and producers have been interviewed about the programme’s five decades, a ’50 Years of Horizon’ ebook will soon be published and there is a good selection of past programmes available

, the planetary scientist, has died age 70.,Pillinger, who was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2005, began his career at
Nasa
, analysing samples of moon rock on the Apollo programme, and made headlines in 1989 when he and colleagues at the
Open University
found traces of organic material in a Mars meteorite that had fallen to Earth.,But he is best known for his remarkable and dogged battle to launch
Beagle 2 Mars lander
, named after HMS Beagle, the vessel that carried
Charles Darwin
during two of the expeditions that would lead to his theory of natural selection.,A model of the pioneering but ill-fated probe, designed to sniff for signs of life, can be found in the
Exploring Space
gallery of the Science Museum.,The instruments, such as its camera, microscope, robot arms, mass spectrometer, gas chromatography, drill, and electronics had to fit inside the a compact 33 kg saucer which would unfurl on the surface of the Red Planet .,Although the craft was successfully deployed from the
Mars Express Orbiter
in December 2003, on which it was piggybacked, confirmation of a successful landing on Christmas Day never came and it became another of the many failed Mars missions.,But it does tell you a great deal about Pillinger’s remarkable personality. He made it happen through a mix of persistence, personality, endless lobbying and show-business flair, enlisting the help of half of the Britpop band Blur (who composed the call sign) and the artist Damian Hirst (who created the spots on the instrument’s camera calibration card).,Beagle 2 did succeed brilliantly in its secondary and perhaps more significant role: enthusing the British about space. It was Colin perhaps more than anyone else who showed the full value and importance of space exploration, and how it fits with that very human capacity to dream.,His wife Judith, and children Shusanah and Nicolas, issued a statement: “It is with profound sadness that we are telling friends and colleagues that Colin, whilst sitting in the garden yesterday afternoon, suffered a severe brain haemorrhage resulting in a deep coma.  He died peacefully this afternoon at Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge, without regaining consciousness. “,British science has lost a star.,Doug Millard is curator of Space and Roger Highfield is Director of External Affairs at the Science Museum."

Not only do we go out and actively seek objects but we also get offered some real gems. Recently arrived at the Science Museum is this rather wonderful object.,Major Scott Thomson (1909-1992), a bacteriologist, used this chest was used to carry supplies of
penicillin
to combat gas gangrene during the Second World War.,Scott Thomson’s career during the Second World War began as Pathologist to various military hospitals until 1943 when he was appointed by the War Office to be bacteriologist to the Penicillin Research Team. Thomson was posted to Algiers in May 1943 with surgeon Ian Fraser after under going special training at Oxford with
Howard Florey
.,On returning to Britain with the successful results of his trials, a decision was taken by the MRC Penicillin Committee to concentrate supplies of penicillin in one area of main battle activity in Italy. In December 1943 he was posted to Monte Cassino and according to his obituary in the
Journal of Medical Microbiology
he was responsible for all of the world’s supply of penicillin during those months – a fact his daughters remember him retelling.,Like many of his contemporaries, Scott Thomson talked little about his time during the Second World War. However, I was lucky enough to meet Major Scott Thomson’s family who delighted me with the snippets of information that they had about his experiences.,Consisting of just five people, the Penicillin units were often at the back of every march, considered at the lower end of the army hierarchy. The lines between Allied and Axis forces were often so blurred that senior Axis officers wandered into the Allied camp.,Scott Thomson believed that the medical profession’s job was to cure and bacteriology was the main way of doing this and focussed his research into
antibiotics
. In the late 1960s, his daughters remember him talking about the overuse of antibiotic resistance – a subject which is always in the
news
.,By far, my favourite snippet the family were kind enough to share was the lyrics to
Song for Penicillin
which may have been penned by a German friend of Thomson with German, English and Italian lyrics. Although the tune is not known, but believed to be based a popular German oompah song. I’ll leave you with the chorus of the song:,German Doctor, are you willin’?,Go and try this Penicillin,This is something else than killin’ – Penicillin!,Penicillin! Penicillin!"

reincarnate the Longitude Prize
on its 300
th
anniversary is not just a matter of money, though it is certainly newsworthy, nor is it simply the glory of being the first, or best, or most innovative.,As Jimmy Wales, Wikipedia founder put it, it is also because “we want a culture where kids aspire to be great scientists and get the societal recognition.”,And he hoped the prize, launched last year by the Prime Minister, would motivate those who lie outside the traditional spheres of well-funded grand institutions and specialised scholars and ‘tap into all the other crazy people out there.’,Wales was addressing the Longitude Lounge, organised at the museum by
Nesta

The aim is to ‘push innovation on the boundaries of the possible and impossible,’ Geoff Mulgan, Nesta Chief Executive, told leading innovators who had gathered at the museum.,The
new prize
is open to anyone, anywhere, he said. However, in a departure from the original, it is also down to the public to decide which of six challenges to tackle around low carbon flight, food and water security, and paralysis, antibiotic resistance and dementia (you can vote

).,The prize has been promoted on the BBC. Amazon is emailing its UK customers, estimated to be many millions, to encourage them to take part. And around 300 schools have registered to take part in the Longitude Prize schools programme.,How will the public vote? Wales said that the six challenges all have ‘different levels of public appeal and prizeability’ but, on balance, he backed the paralysis challenge, not least because it could benefit from a wide range of existing computer and machine assisted technologies.,Also speaking was Naveen Jain, entrepreneur and founder of Moon Express, who said he felt the public would back the water challenge ‘but it if is audacious, it has to be dementia.’,The third speaker, designer, artist and writer Daisy Ginsberg, picked the antibiotics and food challenges, though she felt that food was perhaps the more exciting. ‘We should put our money where our mouth is.’,Lord Rees
, who chairs the Longitude Committee, said that once the public had voted, an expert group would formulate the rules for the prize (‘that is going to be the difficult part’) but he added that he hoped the remaining areas would find commercial sponsors.,He said that it was inspirational to have the meeting in the
Science Museum
, ‘the greatest shrine to science, technology and innovation.’,Lord Rees added that he hoped that he would not be as curmudgeonly as his Longitude predecessor, Reverend Dr Nevil Maskelyne who was Astronomer Royal from 1765 to 1811 and sat on the first Board of Longitude.,Click

Longitude Prize 2014 Challenges
:,Water
Water is a finite resource and we must seek to find ways of producing more fresh water. Some 98% of the Earth’s water is too salty for drinking or agriculture and as water requirements grow and as our reserves shrink, many are turning to desalination. However the current desalination technology isn’t optimal for small-scale use.,Antibiotics
Antibiotics have changed the face of healthcare for the better; they on average add 20 years to over lives. 80 years on from the discovery of penicillin, we are still unable to distinguish bacterial from viral infections, or the type of bacteria in the clinic, which has caused the overuse of antibiotics and the evolution of multidrug-resistant strains of bacteria.,Dementia
An ageing population means more people are developing dementia and unfortunately there is currently no existing cure. This means there is a need to find ways to support a person’s dignity, physical and emotional wellbeing and extend their ability to live independently.,Paralysis
Paralysis can emerge from a number of different injuries, conditions and disorders and the effects can be devastating. Every day can be a challenge when mobility, bowel control, sexual function and respiration are lost or impaired. We need to find a way to vastly increase the freedom of movement for people with paralysis.,Food
The world’s population is growing, getting richer and moving to cities. Current estimates suggest that by 2050 there will be about 9 billion people on the planet; moreover our tastes will have turned to more resource-hungry foods such as meat and milk. In the face of limited resources and climate change, we must learn how to feed the world with less.,Flight
The rapid growth of carbon emissions caused by air travel needs to be addressed to help tackle climate change. The potential of zero-carbon flight has been demonstrated but it has had little impact on the carbon footprint of the aviation industry, which still relies exclusively on fossil fuels. We need to bring novel technologies into the mainstream to stimulate a significant change.,The Science Museum opens the world of science and technology to everyone.

has announced his ambitions
to create a northern “supercity” to rival London as a global hub by building HS3, a high speed rail link between Manchester and Leeds. He was speaking, appropriately enough, at our sister museum, the
Museum of Science and Industry
, Manchester, which tells the story of where science met industry to create the modern world and, as the Chancellor himself highlighted, is the site of the world’s oldest surviving passenger railway station.,His speech, to around 50 key individuals from the region, among the beam engines and other great machines of the museum’s Power Hall, was introduced by Science Museum Group Director, Ian Blatchford, who leads the largest group of science museums in the world which, as he pointed out, lie on “both sides of the Pennines”.,The Chancellor described how he wanted to channel long-term investment into links between the traditionally rival cities, which have a combined population of nine million, similar to that of London. “We need a Northern powerhouse,” he said. “Not one city, but a collection of cities – sufficiently close to each other, that combined, they can take on the world.” To offset the huge gravitational pull of London, the Chancellor also wants to take advantage of the world class universities and teaching hospitals in the north, and “iconic museums such as this one” to create a belt of innovation that straddles the Pennines along the M62 corridor.,Among the audience listening to his vision for a “third high speed railway for Britain” along the existing rail route, was Sir David Higgins, Chairman of HS2, who has identified the need for better connections in the north. After the Chancellor’s speech on how to make these northern cities more than the sum of their parts, the Prime Minister, David Cameron visited the museum for a round table with key individuals, including Ian Blatchford, Sir David and Lord Heseltine.,The Chancellor’s ambitions to bootstrap the north’s knowledge-based economy by prioritising science investment – which included a challenge to those in the audience to come up with a “Crick of the north” (a reference to the biomedical research powerhouse under construction in London) – dovetail with those of the Science Museum Group, which wants to make the Museum of Science and Industry a regional hub for the development of world class exhibitions. The £800,000 financial support for the museum announced by the Chancellor in May has kick-started a £3 million plan for a purpose-built exhibition space that will shift the centre of gravity of the Group towards the north and enable the Museum of Science and Industry to develop its own exhibitions that can tour to the rest of the group and beyond.,Plans are already under way to develop
an exhibition on graphene,
Manchester’s latest global scientific export, in 2015, said Mr Blatchford. The properties of this new form of carbon, found by Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov at the
University of Manchester
, are extraordinary and graphene has potential in the aerospace, automobile, electronics, and communications industries.,The Museum of Science and Industry has appointed Sally MacDonald as its new Director who will start in September. She is currently the Director of Public and Cultural Engagement at University College London (UCL), and will succeed Jean Franczyk, who is leaving the museum after two years to become Deputy Director of the Science Museum.,The Chancellor’s full speech can be viewed on the

Before I have time to give that mental image the thorough probing that it deserves, I’m given a bit of context. “We’ve found
a bra,
some
shoes
…”,‘And an entire suit. And money. And a television,’ adds her colleague Hannah Burke. We’re standing in the basement of the Museum, surrounded by the bagged detritus of the previous day – waste from galleries, cafés, offices and kitchens. But they’re here for a good reason: this, friends, is art. Katyanna and Hannah are two of the many volunteers helping artist Joshua Sofaer in his quest to document an entire month’s Museum waste.,Joshua’s Rubbish Collection is
an unusual art installation
– over the next few weeks, every single item that goes into a Museum bin will be taken out again and publicly documented. Joshua is building a photographic archive of 21st century Museum waste – every receipt, every teabag, every half-eaten potato (and, it would appear, every bra and every television). For the last few months I’ve been watching my colleagues work with Joshua to draw this idea, this ‘contemporary archaeology’ project, out of Joshua’s head and onto the Museum floor. Today, I’ve come to see the result – and to meet the Museum volunteers at the centre of this unique archive.,Joshua hopes that the Rubbish Collection will make us “… consider
what we choose to keep, what we discard, and why.
” It’s certainly making the volunteers think.,‘I’ve seen whole uneaten lunches from Waitrose. Not touched at all. You just think, “Why didn’t you take it home?”’ says Hannah Tran. ‘Even Museum cafés create food waste – obviously they can’t keep sandwiches forever, but on the night shift we get a lot of completely unopened paninis.’,Katyanna shares Hannah Tran’s unease at the sheer volume of waste we produce. ‘You see how much of it there is and think, “I shouldn’t waste so much. I should recycle more.” Some stuff that could be recycled is just put in with general waste, and then it’s contaminated so you can’t recycle it.’ Katyanna, like many of the volunteers here, was driven to get involved with
The Rubbish Collection
because she feels that we need to make ourselves think about waste. ‘So much media attention is devoted to wildlife at risk, to species going extinct … but still, some people don’t really care. So this project is an interesting way to talk to the public and get them to think about rubbish, and recycling, differently.’,So what do visitors make of the whole experience?,‘Well, it looks really factory-like in here. Because we’re dressed in boiler suits, I think people come over and think, “Oh, these guys are working!”’ says Katyanna. ‘So I go, “Hi! Do you want to sort rubbish?”, and explain what we’re doing. Some people do really enjoy it and try their hardest to make something pretty out of it. Some people are disgusted by it, but do it anyway.’,Visitors don’t have to get too close for comfort , of course. They’re just as welcome to come and observe the documentation process, and to talk to Joshua and his friendly team of assistants and volunteers. It’s certainly not the sort of gallery you see often. Or, indeed, ever.,‘I don’t think visitors to the
Science Museum
expect to find an art installation here. Especially this one, because it’s not “done” yet. It’s quite conceptual,’ says Hannah Tran. ‘It’s very different from the other stuff in the Museum. But people are really curious – kids are more interested in the rubbish itself, and older people often want to talk about the kind of stuff we find, but also about just how much waste there is.’,Tempted to take part? Let Hannah Burke convince you. ‘Although it may sound crazy, many of the rubbish bags have their own interesting stories to tell, and that can really make the job of sorting through rubbish worthwhile. It is always exciting to see enthusiastic members of the public become immersed at the task in hand. I can’t wait to see what interesting items the next three weeks have to offer!’,Phase 1 of
The Rubbish Collection
runs until 15 July 2014. Phase 2 is open from 25 July to 14 September 2014."

The Rubbish Collection
, Matt Moore, Head of Sustainable Development for the Science Museum Group, looks at how we measure and minimise the environmental impact of our exhibitions and galleries.,The Science Museum Group places sustainability at the heart of its work. In 2010 we created a sustainability
policy
that would sit at the heart of all our official work practices, but well before that we were developing ideas and projects that would pave the way for the innovative work we do today.,In 2005 we became the first national museum to install solar panels on the roof – awarded for innovation by the Department for Trade and Industry – which have so far produced over half-a-million kW of energy for the museum. It’s amazing how quickly technology is developing; those original panels produced 80W, our soon-to-be-installed new panels generate 280W and newer designs will be even more energy efficient.,While it’s easy to get carried away with whizz-bang new kit, we need to be conscious that our buildings, subject to changing building techniques over the last 100 or so years, are complicated to heat, light and make suitable for our visitors and irreplaceable objects.,We increasingly look at the ‘fabric-first’ approach to sustainability as we develop new projects and structures. By being intelligent with the building structures we can use the materials they are made from to help passively maintain good conditions for the objects they contain. The
Hempcrete Museum Store
at our Wroughton site is a fantastic example of this. It uses a hemp and lime construction medium to balance the humidity within the building according to temperature, decreasing the amount of air-conditioning that is required.,This work is not all big innovation though, there are many small, practical steps that have been taken to make the museum more energy efficient; from reprogramming the building management systems and lighting controllers to turning kit on only when it’s needed and changing our light bulbs to ever more efficient versions. This is important work for buildings of this scale and achieves impressive results – the lighting alone at our sister museum, the
National Railway Museum
, accounted for 44% of the energy used!,It is important when we develop new exhibitions and galleries that we plan and collaborate on the impacts and benefits that materials, electronic equipment and staff activity all have on a project. When the
Atmosphere
gallery was conceived, considerable effort was spent on understanding the environmental footprint, from the procurement chain to end of life disposal. This has become a core element of exhibitions being developed today; none more so than the
Rubbish Collection
!,Waste is an inevitable by-product of the Museum’s operation, and we are becoming more agile at dealing and developing new ways to divert this resource away from pointless burial. Our current system ensures that almost no waste is sent to landfill. What can’t be recycled is sent to
Grundon’s
highly efficient energy from waste plant, where with the increasing value of some of the raw materials means that our waste can become products that have a second, third or even fourth life after leaving the museum. Keeping waste to a minimum is an important part of the story, and through procurement we encourage suppliers to minimise both the travel distances for their products and the packaging associated with them.,Across our group of Museums, sustainability initiatives over the last year have seen many successes: at Wroughton, biodiversity actions have brought two poor-condition County Wildlife Sites into a land management plan. The cafés at
all
our sites achieved high levels of recognition from the
Sustainable Restaurants Association
for sourcing food from local and ethical suppliers, along with good practice within the cafés to minimise food waste and energy use. Café development at the Science Museum over the last few months has included innovatively planted walls and herb gardens in the new
terrace
area. Our procurement team is working hard to ensure that our suppliers and contractors have a good record and work with us to improve sourcing and energy efficiency.,So, what does the future hold for sustainability in the Science Museum Group? An ever-increasing need to be efficient in energy use will see developments in building fabric performance, energy efficiency technology and energy generation at our sites and when we develop our visitor spaces, new materials, efficient interactives and intelligent systems will add to the Museum experience. We’ll also be trying to put more energy back into the national grid than we take out with a 40MW solar project at our Wroughton site – that’s about four times the electricity that the Science Museum Group consumes!,Phase 1 of
The Rubbish Collection
runs until 15 July 2014. Phase 2 is open from 25 July to 14 September 2014."

current exhibition
? Known as the Pediclean, the object is a prototype for a manual foot shower product, designed by Sophia Laycock, the winner of
a competition we ran last year
– which called on young people to come up with an invention to solve a problem they encountered with the great British summer.,The competition had an amazing response. From submersible beach shelters (to keep your spot on the beach even after the tide has come in), to suncream dispensing sunshades, we were bowled over by people’s creative ideas.,Choosing a winner was a challenge. Along with my fellow judges from the Museum, Phill Dickens from Nottingham University’s
3D Printing Research Group
and Atti Emercz  from the
Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council
, I spent an inspiring morning discussing the inventions and admiring their ingenuity.,In my experience, the best inventions are those designed to address a specific problem, are easy to use and look visually appealing. On this basis, it was easy to pick Sophia’s idea as the winning entry.,However, my biggest challenge was working out how to translate Sophia’s drawing of the Pediclean into a real working product. How could I harness the power of 3D printing to make this a reality?,It occurred to me that it might be nice for Sophia to be able to print her very own Pediclean products on her new
Makerbot
printer – the prize she won for the competition. To do this I had to ensure that the Pediclean could be assembled from components that could all be printed successfully on a Makerbot. Essentially, this involved splitting up the device into six individual parts which could each be printed on the Makerbot. Each piece took approximately two hours to print. When all the parts were printed, I then screwed them together to form the finished Pediclean.,Luckily, Sophia’s design was brilliantly well thought out, containing detailed instructions – even down to the placement of the water nozzles designed to clean the foot. I was able to copy the sketch exactly to produce a final product that worked beautifully well.,You can see the Pediclean and lots of other examples of how entrepreneurs, artists and designers are using 3D printing to realise their dreams, in our free exhibition."

Given the strong views some people have about this booking, I wanted to provide some context about the museum’s commercial activities.,As Director, I have a responsibility to balance financial sustainability with achieving our goal to be the leading international museum championing the understanding, enjoyment and prestige of science. The financial challenge faced by our museums has grown in recent years when the tough economic climate has seen our Government funding reduced by more than 30 per cent in real terms since 2010.,Our response to this fiscal challenge has involved a combination of reducing our running costs and increasing the income we generate. Alongside philanthropic support from individuals and companies we continue to expand the range and scope of our commercial activities, including offering spaces for hire for corporate events outside the hours when the museum is open to the public.,Among the many corporate events taking place at the museum this year is the welcome reception for Farnborough International Airshow. The show is a key event for the UK aerospace industry, a subject area in which the Science Museum holds major collections and an industry which is a prominent investor in science and engineering. We treated this event as we would a booking from any other legitimate organisation.,The revenue generated by bookings such as this plays an important role in the funding mix that enables us to remain free to millions of visitors, run the biggest educational programme of its kind, and allows us to curate world-class exhibitions.,I respect people’s right to hold different views but I believe we are making the right decisions to secure the long-term future of the museum for the public good."
https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/modern-art-is-rubbish/,Sarah Harvey,Modern Art Is Rubbish,,Exhibitions and Galleries,"art,climate,Inventor in residence,the rubbish collection","Phase 1 – Mark Champkins, Science Museum Inventor-in-Residence,Tuesday 15 July was the last day of sorting through Museum waste for
The Rubbish Collection
project, and my last chance to put in a shift filtering through discarded drinks bottles and leftover lunches.,The project is fascinating. It aims to examine what constitutes the waste that passes through the Museum, where it would normally go, and what might be usefully recycled.,The exhibition is split into two parts. The first involves the collection of every piece of waste generated by the Museum over a month. A team of volunteers has been sorting and photographing the contents of the Museum’s rubbish bags, and pulling out items of particular interest. The second part will start on 25 July, and will be an exhibition of cleaned and collated rubbish materials.,As I began my shift, what struck me first was the smell of the gallery. It’s a sweet, fruity smell, not unlike over-ripe apples. It comes from the vast amount of sugary drinks and half eaten fruit thrown into the bins, the likely source being the hundreds of packed lunches eaten in the Museum every day. Throughout the Museum, the usual bins have been replaced with ‘General Waste’ and ‘Recycling’ bins. It soon became clear to me that in order to avoid the worst of the smell, the bags to pick out to sort through are the ones marked ‘Recycling’. This avoids the majority of the decomposing foodstuffs.,The task is to open up the bags, lay out the contents on a large white table, sort the contents as you see fit, and then snap a photo of the arranged items on an overhead camera. The opportunity to arrange the rubbish in whatever way you want has brought out the creativity of the volunteers. To this end, within a few days, a tumblr account was opened to show off some of the most imaginative of the layouts. Amongst my favourites are the seascape, composed of blue plastic bags and fruit, and blazing sun in the sky, made from bread sticks, paper towels and what looks like parsley. You can have a look
here
.,After half a dozen bags, a disheartening pattern starts to emerge. Much of what is being thrown away is perfectly good. Lots of the food is unopened or untouched. Leaflets and flyers are almost always pristine. It’s as though the bins are being used to de-clutter, rather than being a place to put things when they have reached the end of their useful lives. It seems inexplicable how many of the items have ended up in the bins. Three wheelchairs have been collected, over a dozen shoes, two fridges, a bra and a giant toothbrush.,Spurred by the some of the weird and wonderful items collected I have set myself a challenge. Like a Science Museum Womble, I aim to filter through the items left behind to put together some items that can be repurposed and redesigned to make a one-off product, that we can sell in the
Museum shop
. Watch this space…,Phase 2 – Sarah Harvey, Project Curator, The Rubbish Collection,After 30 frenzied days of documenting all the Science Museum waste, you might have expected artist Joshua Sofaer to take a well-earned break. No such luck. Since the documentation finished on 15 July, The Rubbish Collection has remained a hive of activity and an almost miraculous transformation has taken place. Gone are the sorting tables, bin bags and faint whiff of old packed lunch; in their place Joshua has created an intriguing and magical exhibition showcasing 30 days of Science Museum rubbish.,The exhibition is comprised of some of the bizarre and surprising items that were retained from the bins in the documentation phase of the project, displayed alongside almost 18 tonnes of materials processed and recycled from the Science Museum rubbish. Both the scale and the beauty of these materials and objects is quite unexpected, and I don’t want to ruin the surprise, so I’m just going to give you some teaser images (below). The exhibition opens to the public at 11am on Friday 25 July, so please come down and experience the wonder of ‘rubbish’ for yourself.,,Phase 2 of Joshua Sofaer’s The Rubbish Collection opens at the Science Museum on 25 July and runs until 14 September 2014."

Sarah Harvey, Project Curator, talks to Neil Grundon, Deputy Chairman of Grundon Waste Management.,Grundon
is the Science Museum’s main waste contractor, handling all our general and recyclable waste – approximately 30 tonnes per month in total! The Museum’s waste either goes to their Colnbrook Materials Recovery Facility and transfer station, or if non-recyclable, to the Lakeside Energy from Waste plant. Lakeside produces around 37 Megawatts of electricity each year – enough to power 50,000 homes.,I spoke to Neil Grundon, the company’s Deputy Chairman, about the future of recycling and waste management, and what we can all do to help.,Sarah: What does Grundon do?,Neil:
Grundon is one of the UK’s leading suppliers of
waste management
and environmental services. We partner with our customers to help them reduce the financial and environmental impacts of their waste.,Sarah: What are the strangest or most difficult things to deal with that people throw away?,Neil:
The strangest thing I’ve seen is a stuffed European Bear holding a lampstand. We’ve also taken a variety of wooden spacecraft used on film sets.,With regards to the most difficult things to deal with, my personal dislikes are garden hoses, inflatable rubber dinghies and beach balls. They always come in as one-offs and are impossible to segregate and recycle. I am sure that somebody will correct me on this, but by the time they reach us the only thing that we can do is to incinerate them for energy. Oh, I would also add those fluorescent glow necklaces that people wear at festivals – I dislike those too.,Sarah: What do you see as being the main challenges that the industry faces?,Neil:
The main challenge for the industry is one of perception. Believe it or not, it is the leaders of waste management companies who lay awake at night wondering how to recycle composite plastics, not the manufacturers, the pressure groups or the public.,Sarah: What can consumers and organisations do better?,Neil:
All consumers and organisations can do better – companies like Grundon only take away waste and treat it. We trust you to do the right things – and put it in the right bin!,My top 3 things that people could do differently would be:,1.
Where possible to separate food waste. It contaminates recyclables and it is heavy and too expensive to dispose of in landfill.,2.
Choose what you buy wisely, as ‘recycled’ does not always mean recyclable.,3.
Simply – use recycling bins.,Sarah: How can we encourage the public to recycle more?,Neil:
The public need incentives to recycle. People see no benefit from separating their waste and are often conflicted when they hear various scare stories in the media.,Grundon have invested in a company called
Greenredeem
to correct this disconnect between us and the consumer. Greenredeem combines ‘reverse vending’ kiosk technology with a web-based membership and reward scheme. It aims to encourage people to recycle at home and ‘on the go’ and to help cut the vast number of cans and bottles which end up in landfill from litter bins or simply thrown away on the street.,Sarah: What do you think the industry will be like in 50 years’ time? What are the new innovations and technologies that you are exploring at the moment?,Neil:
If the industry changes as much in the next 50 years as it has in the last 20 years it will be unrecognisable. At present we have two initiatives that we are very excited about. The first uses carbon dioxide to fix heavy metals within incinerator fly ash (a by-product of the Energy from Waste process) to create a carbon negative aggregate, which is used to create building blocks.,The second is a large facility that has been designed to extract the propellant gases and liquid content from aerosols and capture it for reuse. The added bonus is that we can then also recycle the aluminium and steel cans.,I am very excited about
3D printing
, as I think it will revolutionise the supply chain and hopefully eliminate much of our packaging. However, there is a question mark over what we do with redundant printed material. One of the greatest challenges for the industry will be what to do with the recycled products of today when they become the waste products of tomorrow.,Many of these materials will happily go round time and time again, however that garden hose… …well who knows!,Sarah: What did you think when you first heard about Joshua Sofaer’s ‘The Rubbish Collection’ project?,Neil:
What did I think? Well, it’s great that Joshua and the exhibition is raising awareness of the value of waste. Thank you Joshua, we need all the help we can get!,Visitors can take part in Phase 1 of
The Rubbish Collection

‘s rubbish have come to a close. It’s been surprising, sometimes shocking and certainly thought-provoking, fun, hard work and, at times, a little bit smelly!,We’ve documented all the rubbish produced by the Museum’s 281,647 visitors, 500+ staff and contractors, five cafés, two building sites, three shops, two

, one
Lates
event and several storage cupboard clearances. We’re still waiting to see the figures but, it’s safe to say, it was a lot of rubbish.,Over the thirty days, artist
Joshua Sofaer
, his assistants and the Science Museum volunteers, along with hundreds of brave visitors eager to take up this unique opportunity to get up-close and personal with the trash, have rummaged tirelessly through approximately 250 bags of rubbish per day.,Along with the expected items like crisp packets, drinks cans and the remains of thousands of kids’ lunch boxes, we’ve also found some more unexpected objects hidden amongst the detritus of everyday Museum life. 16.5 pairs of shoes, two two-piece suits, a bra, three fridges, one dishwasher, a box of old
floppy disks
(visiting school children didn’t know what they were), piles of discarded over-the-counter medicines, three wheelchairs and a staggering volume of disposable cutlery.,So, what have we learnt from all this investigating and documenting? Aside from the revelation that kids don’t eat the fruit in their packed lunch (one day I’ll count the number of untouched apples we documented), the most obvious thing is that we don’t
recycle
as much as we could.,Over the last few months the Science Museum has been working hard to put new systems in place for separating our rubbish both in public spaces and offices. The addition of recycling bins in public areas is a long overdue step forward for the Museum but we found that almost all recycling bags in public areas were contaminated with non-recyclable rubbish, so we need to do more to encourage and help visitors to recycle while they are here.,The amount of recyclable material lost to incineration because we are not yet separating café waste is a lot more than we would like but there are plans in place to roll out new segregation systems to all the Museum’s cafés in the near future. Just separating out the café food waste could reduce the Museum’s general waste tonnage by around a third.,Whilst the
documentation
was taking place in the Museum, behind the scenes we’ve been doing some detective work to find out where and how those materials are processed and what they go on to become. These days, very little is lost to landfill so most of the rubbish that left the Museum has been transformed into some other physical form, either through recycling or through incineration.,That transformed rubbish is now
travelling back
to the Science Museum, to be reunited with some of the most interesting items we retained from the bins. Over the next 10 days, Joshua Sofaer will be creating an exhibition showcasing what is produced from our rubbish, examining the beauty and value of the materials but also looking at the sheer volume that was produced over one month. The exhibition will open on 25 July but if you want a sneak preview before then, make sure to watch this space…,The Rubbish Collection

The Rubbish Collection
art installation has involved tracing the journeys of the Science Museum’s rubbish, to find out where it goes, and how it is processed. This has enabled us to work out what materials to bring back for display, and in what quantities, to represent 30 days’ worth of Science Museum waste.,Rubbish leaves the museum via a variety of different companies but the vast majority is taken by Grundon Waste Management. It goes to their site at Colnbrook, near Heathrow, which holds three centres; a transfer station, a Materials Recovery Facility and the
Lakeside Energy from waste plant
, co-owned by Viridor Waste Management.,Today I’m going to focus on the materials on display from the Energy from Waste plant. When you think of an incinerator that burns rubbish you might picture a dirty, sooty, very smelly and unpleasant place, but it’s actually an extraordinary, almost clinically clean building (except for the container where the rubbish is held), and it’s surprisingly beautiful with a giant claw grabbing up to six tonnes of rubbish at a time to feed the incinerator fires.,All the Science Museum general (non-recycled) waste goes to Lakeside to be incinerated. Four products come out of that process: energy, incinerator bottom ash, air pollution control residue and clean air. The largest output is energy, with the plant providing enough to power 50,000 homes per year. We have calculated that the energy produced by incinerating one month of Science Museum waste is enough to light one of our gallery bulbs for nearly 24 years.,The energy is produced by burning the rubbish for approximately 3 seconds at 950 degrees centigrade, which is long enough to combust most materials. At the end of the process, incinerator bottom ash is left over. This ash still contains large pieces of metal which are separated and sent to be recycled, and the ash itself is left to ‘mature’ so that chemical reactions can take place that lower its pH value. This aggregate is then used in the construction industry, primarily in road building. You could be driving on your old rubbish.,One of the most remarkable things about the incineration process is that the air that comes out of the plant is actually cleaner than the air that goes in. This is because it is very carefully filtered to contain the toxins released during burning. The filtered ash is known as air pollution control residue (APCr). Historically this toxic ash would have been contained in hazardous waste landfill, but new technologies and research are now finding uses for it. Grundon have invested in a company called
Carbon8
who use carbon dioxide to neutralise the toxic heavy metals and materials, making them permanently non-hazardous. This safe ash can then be used as an aggregate and, alongside other recycled materials including wood, makes the ‘Carbon Buster’ carbon-neutral breeze blocks we have on display in The Rubbish Collection.,It’s been very encouraging to find that the Science Museum rubbish is producing some useful and valuable products through incineration. However, one of the big findings from our documentation of the Museum’s waste was that there is still a lot of recyclable material ending up at the incinerator. Those materials retain much more value when they are recycled so by continuing to improve and refine our recycling systems, and through new initiatives like separating our food waste, we hope in the future to decrease our general waste further.,Phase 2 of Joshua Sofaer’s
The Rubbish Collection

Bellsouth IBM Simon
hit the American market. Weighing in at a hefty half a kilogram, and looking rather like a grey brick, the Simon was advertised with a not-so-snappy slogan declaring it to be “The World’s First Cellular Communicator”.,Although the slogan was a bit of a mouthful, the Simon really did break new ground. It took some of the best technology that the handheld computing world had to offer – personal digital assistants (PDAs) were all the rage in the early 1990s – and combined it with a mobile phone.,With a stylus and touch screen, Simon’s users had all sorts of software applications, or apps, at their fingertips. They might sketch a drawing, update their calendar, write notes on a document, or send or receive a fax.,The Simon was, in effect, the world’s first smartphone; a device that could make calls and be programmed to do a wide range of other things. The built-in features could even be expanded by plugging in memory cards – not quite an app store, but long similar lines.,Despite having some loyal users, and after selling around 50,000 units, the Simon was withdrawn from sale after only 6 months. There were still some key pieces of the puzzle missing to enable a device like the Simon to become really successful. In 1994 the web was in its infancy, so the idea of downloading apps was not practical.,The mobile internet, accessible through mobile phones, was virtually non existent – explaining why fax was a key feature of the Simon. The hardware was also limited. With a battery that only lasted an hour in ‘talk mode’ it wasn’t practical to rely on the Simon to keep you in touch all day long. To top it all off, at $899 the Simon was simply too expensive for most people to justify.,Despite its imitations and brief foray in the marketplace, the Simon brought together many of the
key things
that underpin today’s smartphones. The next big splash in the market came over a decade later. By then, 3G mobile phone networks were available, online app stores were a genuine possibility and microprocessor technology had advanced enough to pack a really powerful computer into a small handheld device.,The IBM Simon will go on display in the Science Museum’s

Information Age
gallery which opens in October.,The aerial inductance coil from Rugby Radio Station will soon have a new home at the Science Museum – see it being installed in the video below.,Measuring 6 metres high and resembling a series of giant spiders’ webs, this monumental coil is a powerful reminder of the invisible infrastructure which supports our desire to communicate.,Based at
Rugby Radio Station
, where it was housed in a huge cathedral-like room, the coil played a vital role in tuning a huge radio transmitter that sent out very low frequency signals. It was part of a huge system that linked the transmitter to the aerial masts, enabling messages to be sent and telegrams to be transmitted. During its long life, Rugby Radio held a huge personal resonance for many individuals, connecting people to each other, to the world and to home.,Rugby Radio Station began transmitting very low frequency signals on 1 January 1926 using the call sign GBR. Once the world’s most powerful radio transmitter, its very low frequency waves could follow the curvature of the Earth to travel very
long distances
, enabling one-way communication to Britain’s Empire. It transmitted wireless telegraph messages from the British Foreign Office, standard time signals from Greenwich, news bulletins, personal telegrams and Christmas greetings.,Although first hailed as a matter of national pride, in later years Rugby Radio Station was a hidden secret that played an important role in the Cold War, as its very low frequency signals could be picked up by submarines.,Godfery Dykes, one of many submarine communication operators, sat in a claustrophobic communications cabin, hunched over the radio, headphones on, sick bucket between his legs, receiving the Morse code signals. His role was to write down in pencil the dots and dashes coming through at the incredible speed of 30 words a minute, a rate that was undecipherable to the untrained ear. The dots and dashes would then be decoded and the messages delivered:,‘GBR meant a lot to us and we used the letters GBR in many ways. At the start of our patrol I used to think Goodbye BeRyl (my wife) …simply to hear Rugby’s call sign meant to me all those I loved back in the UK were still safe. I well remember moments of excitement on coming shallow to periscope depth after many hours down deep, watching the depth gauge creep slowly past 150 feet, 125, feet, 100 feet and then 75 feet, faint at first, that most lovely sound started to fill my ears – God Bless Rugby, GBR’,On 31 March 2003, 77 years after it transmitted its first Morse message, Rugby Radio station ceased broadcasting its very low frequency signals around the world. A year later, the twelve 250m high masts that radiated out Rugby’s signals were
demolished
, marking the end of an era. Former station manager Malcolm Hancock was invited to detonate the first explosion:,“They had been there for so long and the red lights (on top of the masts) had always been there whenever you came home. That is what all the local people in Rugby say, ‘Oh yeah, the thing we’re going to miss is not seeing the red lights saying – oh we’re nearly home now’”.,The coil was donated to the Science Museum by BT Heritage and Archives soon after the decommissioning of Rugby Radio Station. From 25 October, you can see the Rugby Tuning Coil displayed in public for the first time at the centre of the

The Rubbish Collection
exhibition is open at the Museum until 14 September. Having documented every piece of waste that passed through the Museum for a month, this second phase is a chance to see what would have been thrown away.,Of the material that hasn’t been selected for display, I collected a small box of bits that I hoped to turn into a product that we might sell in the shop. I like the idea that with a little bit of effort and imagination, items that would otherwise be chucked, can be turned into something desirable. Unfortunately the collection of items in the box that I had gathered didn’t look at all desirable. A couple of umbrellas, some bits from a light fitting, an old copper funnel, an ash tray, some plastic cutlery, some glass cups and a selection of ball bearings didn’t look very promising.,The germ of my idea came from digging out the copper funnel and investigating it further. It was heavily corroded and covered in green verdigris, but underneath was structurally solid, and a beautiful shape.,I read somewhere that vinegar could be used to clean copper, so I popped down to the café, to get a couple of sachets to try out. It turns out it does a reasonable job on lightly tarnished areas, but can’t handle the extent of corrosion on the funnel. However, it did encourage me that the funnel could be saved.,Next I pulled apart the umbrellas, lined up everything from the box and had a think what I might make. A happy coincidence was that the handle from the umbrella fitted exactly into the top of the funnel.,My first thought was to make some sort of loudspeaker people could shout through. Next, I thought the umbrella handle might plug the funnel to make a water-tight vase or container of some sort.,Finally, looking at the shining clean patch of copper I thought, coupled with a 1950s-style squirrel cage bulb, it might make a really nice light fitting.,The next step was to recondition the copper funnel.,In the basement, the Museum has metal and wood workshops responsible for building, installing and maintaining the structures for new exhibitions. Amongst their equipment is a sandblasting machine, which I used to blast the corrosion from the funnel.,I decided to leave the matt finish left from the sand blasting on the inside surface, and polish up the outside. Using Brasso and eventually a buffing wheel I polished up the outer surface. To ensure the lamp remains pristine, I decided to use a polymer based lacquer, applied in the workshop’s spray booth.,Finally I added the umbrella handle, and a lighting flex and fitting. I think the finished light looks rather good. It’ll be available for purchase in the Museum shop from mid August.,Mark Champkins

The Rubbish Collection
, Curator Sarah Harvey talks to Nick Mills, Waste Innovation Manager at
Thames Water
about what happens to our sewage and what the future holds for wastewater.,Sarah: What do Thames Water do with our sewage?,Nick: We have 350 sewage works and 68,000 miles of sewers across our region, which stretches from East London to the Cotswolds in the west. Last year, we removed and treated 4,369 million litres of sewage from 15 million customers. At our 350 sewage works we treat the sewage to remove contaminants and return it safely to the environment, it is often cleaner than the water in the river.,Sarah: What happens to the end products of the processing?,Nick:
The main end-product of the sewage treatment process is something called sludge. This energy rich by-product is put to good use in anaerobic digestion, producing renewable energy that helps power our treatment sites. The digested sludge is then recycled to agricultural land.,Sarah: What are the biggest challenges you face in dealing with our sewage/ waste water?,Nick:
London has outgrown its sewer system. The Victorian sewers are in great condition, but simply not designed for today’s population. They were designed for just over two million but are used today by just over six million. The proposed Thames Tideway Tunnel will stop tens of millions of tonnes of raw sewage flowing into the Thames every year via the outfall system. It is a must-do job. We can’t keep treating the Thames as a sewer.,Sarah: What are the strangest or most difficult things to deal with that people throw down the drains?,Nick:
‘Bin it – don’t block it’ is our campaign to end the misery caused by fatbergs. Leftover cooking fat and oil poured down the sink will set hard. This creates stinking, pipe-blocking fatbergs beneath your house or in your street.,Wet wipes are another big no-no because they are made of plastic. They don’t break down like toilet tissue, clinging to fat and clogging up the system. If drains get blocked, what you flush can come back up through your toilet or even your sink.,Sarah: What can consumers and organisations do better?  Is there a top 3 list of things people could do differently to help?,Nick:
Our message is simple, if it’s not water, toilet tissue or poo, please… ‘Bin it – don’t block it’.,Sarah: What do you think the industry will be like in 20 years’ time? What are the new innovations and technologies that you are exploring at the moment?,Nick:
In 20 years’ time I can see the wastewater industry becoming a net energy producer, by employing more efficient processes and increasing energy recovery. Combining advanced anaerobic digestion and technologies like
pyrolysis
, large increases can be made. Our Innovation team are busy demonstrating this at the moment. Phosphorus, a finite resource essential to life as we know it, will be recovered at every major sewage works and sold competitively as a fertiliser to farmers, this has also been demonstrated recently at our Slough sewage works by the Innovation team.,Sarah: What did you think when you first heard about Joshua Sofaer’s The Rubbish Collection project?,Nick:
I think it is great. It shows the harsh reality of waste, but at the same time reveals the great work that people do behind the scenes to keep society moving. I hope it will encourage a new generation to start what is a very interesting and rewarding career as there are huge challenges yet to be solved.,Phase 2 of Joshua Sofaer’s

gallery,Antibiotic resistance is one of the biggest challenges of our time. It affects all of us, so perhaps unsurprisingly, it was declared the winner of the
Longitude Prize 2014
.,At the Science Museum, we decided to examine this topic in more depth with a new exhibit,
Your future without antibiotics?
, which explores the rise of antibiotic resistance and the latest research to tackle it.,The exhibit, currently on display in our Who am I? gallery, changes every few months, giving the Science Museum the opportunity to explore current and significant research stories in health, genetics and neuroscience. With over a million people visiting the Who am I? gallery each year, it’s important to design exhibits that are interesting and relevant to our visitors’ lives.,We chose to tell three main stories in the display case. The Rise of Resistance looks at how bacteria have become resistant, Radical Research focusses on the latest research to tackle resistance and Stop the Spread explores how to prevent the spread of infection.,The display features unique and intriguing objects to tell these stories. You can see a Star Trek-inspired hand-held ‘tricorder’ which uses a virus to identify bacterial infection.  Alongside, you can spot a keyboard and mobile phone cover coated with the world’s first light-activated antimicrobial surface that also works in the dark. Other items include a bio-engineered medical honey which can kick start the healing process in wound treatment. There is even a giant, lime green stick insect, whose guts researchers are studying for new antibiotic compounds.,To develop the display case, we spoke to many institutions that focus on tackling antibiotic resistance including the

The Rubbish Collection
, talks to
Dr Philip Morton
, Chief Executive of
REPIC
about the challenges of dealing with growing volumes of electrical and electronic waste.,REPIC is the largest not-for-profit WEEE (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment) recycling scheme in the UK. Instead of letting valuable or harmful waste and scarce raw materials go to landfill, REPIC’s job is to recover and transport used electrical goods and batteries to specialist treatment plants. Upon arrival at the plant, the WEEE waste can be safely handled and recycled into new usable raw materials.,What is WEEE waste?,Every year, people in the UK buy around 1.5 million tonnes of electrical and electronic equipment, like toasters, TVs, washing machines and computers. We throw away about one million tonnes of equipment, so WEEE waste is one of the fastest growing waste streams in the UK and in the EU. It’s important that we take action now to stop it from piling up.,Some of the components used to make electronic goods can be hazardous and harmful to the environment, while others can be recycled and reused. Some are even precious and contain gold, silver, indium or palladium. It’s amazing to think that WEEE contains 40 times more gold than gold ore!,What are the biggest challenges faced by the industry in recycling and recovering these materials?,A big problem is the difficulty in separating the complex scarce trace metals using the technology currently available. Different proportions of trace materials are present in different bits of WEEE and some materials bind together, making separation a challenge.  At present, only a tiny percentage of these metals is captured in the recycling process, so it isn’t sustainable.,What can people do to help?,Just as we separate our plastic bottles and tins from paper and compostables, we need to separate our old electrical appliances and take them to a local recycling centre.,As with electricals, it’s easy for batteries to end up in landfills if the proper recycling channels are not used. Batteries contain chemicals that can be hazardous if released into our soil, water and air.,But there is an alternative. You could save your batteries and take them to special battery bins at shops, schools and recycling centres. This ensures the batteries are recycled responsibly.,Our top three tips are:,What do you think the industry will be like in 50 years time?,To meet the new EU directive we need to recycle 85 percent of WEEE generated in the UK by 2018. The value of WEEE will be higher as there will be less rare metals and raw materials to extract from the Earth.  Advances in technology will mean that electrical goods will be even lighter, more compact and flexible. Think projected keyboards, flatter TV screens – we’re already seeing roll up TV screens – so expect more to come.,,"

invited
engineers from the Power Electronics Group to the Science Museum to share their latest research with our visitors. They are working on
wireless charging
systems to power up electric car batteries, and with them came the
Drayson Racer
, the fastest lightweight electric car in the world. This beautiful, green piece of precision engineering is fast; it broke records at 205mph and can go 0 to 60 in 3 seconds.,This week super speedy cars, much like the Drayson racer, will take part in
Formula E
; the first ever fully electric racing series, starting off in Beijing. The cars in Formula E aren’t quite as fast as the one we had on display, but with top speeds of 140mph it will definitely be entertaining to watch.,There are a few aspects of the Formula E that make it, in my opinion, the best type of racing there is:,Car Swapping,One of the major issues of electric cars is battery life. The racing cars used in Formula E can’t be charged quick enough at the pit stops so the drivers swap to a fully charged car. Given it’s a race the drivers need to hop out and into the other car within a minute. I think it provides an bonus ‘obstacle course’ like challenge that petrol racing really lacks.,Exotic Locations,Yes Formula 1 has exotic location, but Formula E has
raised the game
. The races will be in the heart of some of the most stunning capital cities in the world. Starting in the Olympic park in Beijing the championship will travel round to 10 cities including Berlin, Buenos Aires, Miami, and finishing up in central London in June 2015.,Futuristic Sounding,Electric cars engines are virtually silent. There’ll be no need for ear plugs while watching and given the city centre locations the races won’t be bothering the neighbours as much as petrol racing might. The sound Formula E cars make when racing has been described as anything from eerie to futuristic. They’re so quiet the engineers have to be warned with an air horn before the car come into the pit stops so they can get out of the way in time.,Fanboost,There’s virtually no interaction with the drivers for fans of racing, especially compared to other sports. The drivers can’t hear you cheering, not until they’re no the podium and by that time your encouragements don’t make any difference. Not so in Formula E, you can vote for your favourite driver before the race. The three most popular driver’s get a ‘power boost’ for their cars in the last leg of race.,Formula E will drive innovation in electric cars that’ll quickly trickle down to their domestic counterparts. In the not too distant future the wireless charging system the Power Electronics Group showed our visitors could be in parking spots all over the country ready to charge your electric car.,You can find out more about Formula E by watching the video below.,"

Information Age
gallery.,From the outset, we knew this project would create a special challenge. With an impressive range of assets –  200 years of inventions, 800 unique objects and a vast gallery space measuring 2,500m2, this would be a unique gallery within the Science Museum.,One of the biggest challenges we faced was organising the huge empty space into a navigable gallery whilst giving each object and story a platform on which to shine.,We started with the largest and most impressive object of all – the
aerial tuning coil
from Rugby Radio Station, which we decided to place at the heart of the gallery.,Made from timber and webs of cables, this incredible object looks almost primitive in construction. This ambiguity made it a great tool for us to draw visitors into the centre of the gallery and make them question their preconceptions of modern communications. It is a world away from the common communication devices that spring to mind – mobile phones, micro-chips and digiboxes.,We learnt that the tuning coil was housed underneath a copper shroud – we think to dissipate heat and prevent the timber structure from igniting. This provided us with a material that resonated with the object’s history and a warm, reflective surface for the display. The coil is located where visitors can learn about the transmitter, signal and receiver.,From the centre you can see that
the gallery
is divided into six networks – each one telling stories from a specific section of communication technology. Placed around the outsides of the gallery, similar to the idea of a town square or plaza, we placed large double height display cases. These display structures are designed to house a vast array of objects.,These display structures serve several purposes. One function is to hold up the elevated walkway that encircles the gallery. More importantly, they allow visitors to engage with the incredible objects and stories told in each of the six networks. For this reason, they became known as storyboxes. To provide a varied experience, both a producer and a ‘voice’ were assigned to a storybox for each network, creating an installation of their conception.,The sheer quantity of objects on display within the gallery required meticulous planning of the space.,Stories with large numbers of objects fill showcases, which in turn create smaller spaces and routes throughout the gallery. A key concern was to ensure visitors knew where their attention should be focussed, especially in a gallery without a prescribed route.,We crafted a space that used solid forms and open apertures within the gallery, providing clear groups of objects along with vistas from one section to another.,Lastly, we designed a large encircling walkway that loops around the gallery. We introduced this to provide an overview of the space and an alternative perspective of the gallery. We felt it was important for visitors to understand the context of each story within the scheme of the gallery – allowing them to connect objects from one end of the space to the other.,Fundamentally, this is a gallery about incredible objects, people and stories. The format of the gallery plays a supporting role to these awe-inspiring exhibits. We hope visitors will enjoy experiencing the gallery through the space we have designed.,Nick Rolls is the Design Project Leader at Universal Design Studio. The
Information Age
gallery will be welcoming visitors from 25 October 2014."

exhibition.,Our collections include some of most celebrated icons of manufacturing and engineering in history, including Puffing Billy, Newcomen’s engine and
Stephensons’s Rocket
. These objects embody the ingenuity, resourcefulness and resolve of the engineers and manufacturers who created them.,Fast forward to the present day, and it seems like many people’s perceptions of manufacturing continue to be dominated by heavy industrial images of men in boiler suits bathed in oil, up to their elbows in a machine. Of course, that’s still an integral part of industry, and one not without its attractions. But what we don’t often recognise is just how much contemporary British manufacturing has (literally) smashed these conventions into pieces.,Many people think Britain doesn’t actually make things anymore, but the reality is very different. Making things and selling them around the world remains strategically important for Britain, and its resilience continues to draw many manufacturing companies back to the UK after relocating to the Far East. As well as the mass production of everything from tin can tops to cars, many British companies thrive by carving out their own unique niches, from
building yachts
to weaving fine textiles. Many companies make a reputation for the excellence of their product: Quality sells.,Our exhibition
Open for Business
tells the story of contemporary British manufacturing through the images of nine
Magum photographers
. They each concentrated on a different region of the UK, visiting one-man businesses and FTSE 100 companies like Airbus and Renishaw, to try and create a snapshot of industry across the UK.,Their subjects can seem surprising, with photographs that include
Aardman animators
and theatre propmakers, as well as shipbuilding and factory workers. Renowned photographer David Hurn wanted to show the variety of manufacturing in Wales. Rather than just focus on the coal mines more commonly associated with industry in Wales, he chose to photograph
Corgi Hosiery
, a Welsh company that produces a range of socks designed by Prince Charles.,The incredible diversity of British manufacturing challenges the perceptions of what’s needed behind-the-scenes to make things. Roles in contemporary UK industry are vast, varied and can no longer be defined by the image of men in boiler suits.,Of course, it was ever thus: in the Industrial Revolution, Britain’s reputation as workshop of the world was attributed, not to the rise of the machines, but to the excellence of her people. In 1803, a French commentator praised ‘the wonderful practical skills’ of Britain’s ‘adventurers in the useful application of knowledge, and the superiority of her workmen in rapid and masterly execution’. The same could equally be said about making things in Britain today.,See more stunning images in our

this picture
from the Russian module of the
International Space Station
and you will see two images of a man with a white beard. Known as the grandfather of Soviet space travel, this man dreamt of international space stations as early as the 1890s and cosmonauts still pay homage to him today. Born on this day (17 September) in 1857, the man’s name is
Konstantin Tsiolkovsky
.,Tsiolkovsky’s contribution to the science of space travel is diverse and astonishing, with his work ranging from robust science to science fiction. Citing the work of
Jules Verne
as a
personal  inspiration
, Tsiolkovsky believed science fiction was a valuable tool in advancing and popularising  serious scientific ideas. Subsequently, Tsiolkovksy himself produced three sci-fi novels, and towards the end of his life acted as technical advisor on the production of the Soviet sci-fi film ‘
Cosmic Voyage
’ (1936).,However, Tsiolkovksy’s prominence in the field of space travel is due to his work on the mathematics and mechanics of  how to reach outer space. He
famously calculated
the possibility of doing so by using liquid-propellant rockets. In addition to developing concepts on launch and orbital dynamics, Tsiolkovksy considered devices that would allow a human being to survive in space, including space suits and space food.,Tsiolkovsky’s achievements are even more extraordinary in light of his circumstances. Growing up in a large family of limited means and suffering from severely impaired hearing after contracting scarlet fever as a child, Tsiolkovsky was self-educated. After a brief period in Moscow where he taught himself mathematics, physics, astronomy and chemistry using public libraries, Tsiolkovsky returned to the provinces to become a school teacher and start a family.,Fleeing a bleak existence, he immersed himself in a world of inventions, struggling to get his work published – he was essentially founding a new field of science – but doggedly self-publishing when possible and gaining local followers intrigued by his ideas of metallic air ships, extra-terrestrial life and the colonization of other planets.,Tsiolkovsky’s work was driven by the idea that space travel would allow the human race to abandon Earth in the face of overpopulation and natural catastrophes, thereby securing the continued existence of humanity. He envisioned a species of super humans, a form of eugenics drawing on the likes of
Nietzsche
that does not tend to sit comfortably with those eulogizing his life and work in modern times. These super humans would use Earth as a source of energy and raw materials and cosmic evolution would eventually allow them to shed their physical “shells” and develop into energy, becoming immortal and boundless.,Despite receiving minor recognition from the state following the Russian Revolution of 1917, Tsiolkovsky’s situation remained relatively unchanged until he neared the end of his life in the 1930s when he was officially hailed as a hero.,Following the launch of the Soviet space programme in the 1950s, he went on to achieve cult status. To this day, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky remains a key inspirational and spiritual figure in the cosmonautical movement, alongside Chief Designer

However, I am now confident that it dates from 1837, the year that the practical electric telegraph was introduced in Britain.,Since 1876, the Museum has displayed a smaller five-needle instrument and has claimed it to be one of the original instruments installed at either Euston or Camden Town in 1837 when Charles Wheatstone and William Cooke demonstrated their electric telegraph system to the directors of the newly-opened London and Birmingham Railway.,I had long been suspicious of this because there were several technical features which just did not ‘add up’. All the history books repeated the Museum’s assertion about its originality and yet there was no real evidence to confirm it. I decided it was time to find out for certain.,I researched the whole story again, this time using only contemporary records such as Cooke’s letters, other manuscript documents and press reports. After much work, I concluded that the large dial was almost certainly one of the two 1837 originals, whereas the smaller instrument was likely to be one of the working models made for demonstration at a High Court hearing in 1850 when a rival company was disputing Cooke and Wheatstone’s priority in the invention.,The layout of the dial was Wheatstone’s idea. Any of the 20 letters on the dial can be indicated by making the appropriate pair of needles point to it. No knowledge of a code is needed and the dial is big enough for a crowd of people to see it working. Then as now, good salesmanship was needed to put over new technology.,So why is this discovery so important?,The electric telegraph was the first practical use of electricity and from the 1840s onwards it transformed world communications. After a
transatlantic telegraph cable
was laid in 1866, messages between Europe and North America took only hours to arrive rather than weeks. Moreover, Cooke saw the emerging railway system as a major customer for the new technology. To operate safely, the railways needed to observe a timetable based on a standard time system.,The electric telegraph enabled Greenwich time to be distributed right across Britain, and within a few years local time, based on the times of sunrise and sunset, had been replaced by standard (Greenwich) time. The telegraph could also help catch criminals. In 1845 a message sent from Slough railway station to Paddington enabled murder suspect John Tawell to be identified, arrested, and in due course, executed.,After many years of doubt, I am now satisfied that one of the key inventions from the beginning of electric telegraphy has been authenticated and rightly takes its place in our new
Information Age
gallery.,John Liffen is the Curator of Communications."

850,000 people
in the UK will have been diagnosed with dementia. Dementia is a term used to describe the symptoms of diseases that cause memory loss, confusion and problems with communication. Dementia is progressive,so the symptoms become worse as time goes on.,Until 1906 it was thought that dementia was an inevitable part of growing old. This changed when
Dr Alois Alzheimer
,a leading neurologist who researched the brain and the nervous system, gave a lecture about a disease which caused memory loss, hallucinations and problems with communicating and understanding. He was describing what we now know as Alzheimer’s disease, the most common form of dementia.,Doctors now know that the
death of neuron cells
in the brain is the main cause of dementia. Neurons need nutrients, oxygen and close contact with other cells in order to survive. Scientists are always looking for possible cures for dementia, a great deal of the research is aimed at treating the symptoms, for example trying to delay memory loss.,However, treatment for memory loss does not lie solely in the hands of scientists. Memory boxes, such as the one on display in the
Who Am I? gallery
, are used by people with dementia, with their friends and families, to help them retain memories.,Photographs and objects that have special memories connected to them can be kept inside the boxes. The person with dementia can look through the box and be reminded of people, places and events from their lives. They can be used to trigger memories of a past career or love.,In the next 10 years a further
one million
people in the UK will develop dementia. Whilst scientists research and test treatments, families and communities will continue to develop ways to manage the symptoms. A memory box may seem simple, but it is a method which is accessible, affordable and effective.,The issue of how to treat and manage dementia is experienced by communities all over the world. By 2030, the number of people with dementia worldwide is estimated to reach 65 million.,Some countries are finding unique ways to help people live with the symptoms of dementia. One care home in Amsterdam has created an entire village which is ‘dementia friendly.’ The 152 residents live in the small village of
Hogewey
which has a restaurant, theatre, beauty salon and village shop.  The village is staffed by healthcare workers and volunteers and gives elderly people with dementia a safe environment in which to enjoy everyday life.,What memories would you want to keep in your memory box?,The memory box can be found in the

",At the Museum,"climate,festivals","My name is David and soon I’ll find out whether audiences at the Science Museum can catch a stage-diving Dolly Parton. Since September, we’ve been in residence at the Science Museum preparing for the premiere of our interactive theatre work
Best Festival Ever: How To Manage A Disaster
.,In 2011, the University College London Environment Institute gave us the challenge of creating a theatre show looking at concepts from climate and systems science. Over the last three years we’ve created a work in which a playing audience seated around a table take control of managing their own complex system: a music festival.,,A music festival is an excellent example of a complex system. In a lot of ways, a festival is like a temporary city, with tens of thousands of people coming together for a few days on a patch of land. Over the course of the show we examine some of the interesting ways in which systems behave and ask ourselves: how can we recognise and better think about the systems we’re part of?,I don’t want to give away too much about the show, but I thought I might share some of what audiences have to do to put on the best festival ever.,1. Programming the lineup,Obviously you want the best possible artists to play your festival: Do you take the 9-piece reggae collective over the teenage Youtube sensation? The folk ensemble or the glitchy electronica artist? But you’ll need to find sponsors to pay for them. As always in complex systems, there are trade-offs. Some sponsors may offer more, but may also be ethically… interesting. Whatever you decide, you’ll have to live with.,2. Building a festival site,Putting on a festival sometimes means constructing, inhabiting and packing down an entire temporary city. You’ll be in charge of organising the layout of your festival – placing gates, stages, food stalls and face-painting stalls – and then making everything both quickly and beautifully. Of course, when everything is connected, decisions made in one place will have consequences throughout the festival, often in unexpected ways.,3. Electricity,Festivals usually don’t run off the main grid. You’ll have to take control of the generators, ensuring that power goes to where it’s most needed. Managing this common-pool resource will involve prioritising: amazing laser light show on stage two vs turning on the water filters to stop sewage leaking into the river that flows into the nearby village.,4. Concerts,The most crucial part of any music festival, and also the hardest to manage. Can your security guards prevent fights from breaking out in the moshpit? Can you get the band onstage and hitting all the right solos? And are you ready if Justin Timberlake decides to jump right into the moshpit?,We’ll be presenting these shows at the Science Museum on 17-19 November, along with climate and systems scientists talking about the ways in which this show intersects with their own work.

J Lyons & Company ran tea shops across Britain. But the company was also interested in improving the way its work was managed and conducted, so it decided to build a computer that could support the collection and analysis of this information. Brought to life on 17 November 1951, LEO I played a crucial role in the development of a new computer age.,Working with the team at the University of Cambridge that had built the EDSAC computer in 1949, Lyons developed the LEO I, assembling it at the Lyons main factory building in West London. The computer ran its first program on 5 September 1951, valuing the cost of goods that came out of the bakeries.,The company LEO Computers Ltd was formed in 1954 and went on to build LEO II and LEO III. These were installed in many British offices including those of Ford, Customs and Excise, the Inland Revenue and the Post Office.

The rest is used for the amazing indoor rocket that demonstrates Newton’s 3rd Law of Motion (“for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction”), where we attempt to launch a
Pringles tube
into Space…something that gets a response from even the teenagers!,So, together with setting fire to stuff and blowing stuff up, we dress up, ride on chairs with wheels and generally have a rocket-tastic time with the help of plenty of brave volunteers and the brilliance of Sir Isaac Newton.,Intrigued??

He lived through an age of great technological change, which saw the development of flight, electronics, atomic physics, telephones and televisions, mass consumerism and mass destruction.,He spoke of Sir Winston’s passion for aviation and how he was probably the first Government minister to learn how to fly, at a time when the sport was still considered highly dangerous. This story is brought to life in the exhibition through the display of a model aeroplane.,Randolph also read an extract from a prescient 1924 essay by his great-grandfather that highlighted Churchill’s acute awareness of both the creative and destructive potential of science. The essay speculates about
“a bomb no bigger than an orange”
with
“the secret power to destroy a whole block of buildings – nay to concentrate the force of a thousand tons of cordite and blast a township at a stroke”.,Churchill’s Scientists
illuminates other aspects of Churchill’s life including his love of fashion, shown in the display of a green velvet ‘siren suit’ – an all-in-one ‘romper suit’ which bears strong resemblance to the ‘onesie’. At the heart of the exhibition are the stories of the individuals who flourished under Churchill’s patronage, from
Robert Watson-Watt
, inventor of radar, to
Bernard Lovell
who created the world’s largest radio telescope, told through unique objects, original archive film footage, letters and photographs.,The exhibition forms part of
Churchill 2015
, a year-long programme of events that commemorate Churchill’s life, work and achievements.,The exhibition is supported by players of People’s Postcode Lottery, The Stanley Foundation and The de Laszlo Foundation. The exhibition is free and runs until March 2016."

382 members of parliament casting in favour and 128 against
, is expected to lead to the United Kingdom becoming a pioneer in mitochondrial replacement methods.,I wrote one of the
first newspaper accounts
of mitochondrial donation for The Daily Telegraph a decade ago, and also chaired
a debate
on the technique on Monday night, organised by the
Progress Educational Trust
in the Houses of Parliament.,The debate was hosted by Luciana Berger, Labour and Cooperative MP for Liverpool Wavertree, and Shadow Minister for Public Health.  Among the audience of around 150 people were MPs, Lords, fertility experts and members of families affected by mitochondrial disease.,After being introduced by Fiona Fox of the Science Media Centre, who is also chair of the Progress Educational Trust, I reminded the audience that we were there as an indirect result of events that took place one or two billion years ago: that’s when
bacteria invaded the cells of our ancestors to trade chemical energy for a cosy home.,But, of course,
mitochondria
can suffer faults and the Commons was about to debate methods designed to prevent children being born with some 50 or so metabolic disorders that result this way. Almost
2,500 women of child-bearing age in the UK are at risk
of passing on disease caused by faults in mitochondria to their children.,The speakers debating the safety and ethics on Monday night were: Frances Flinter, Professor of Clinical Genetics at King’s College London; John Harris, Professor of Bioethics and Director of the Institute for Science, Ethics and Innovation at the University of Manchester; Dr David King, Founder and Director of Human Genetics Alert and Philippa Taylor, Head of Public Policy at the Christian Medical Fellowship, and Consultant on Family and Bioethics at Christian Action Research and Education.,Important contributions to the discussion came from members of affected families, the pioneer of the research, Prof Doug Turnbull of Newcastle University, journalist and author Matt Ridley and Prof Andy Greenfield,  who chaired the HFEA Scientific Review panel.,What was gratifying was that on Tuesday the debate was cited by several MPs – including Luciana Berger, Liz McInnes and Guy Opperman  – in their contributions to the House of Commons debate before the historic vote in favour of this form of gene therapy.,Another MP even complained that we had more time for our public debate than the MPs had for their debate in the Commons.,The science and ethics of mitochondrial donation have been the subject of an exhibit in the Science Museum and years of high-profile discussions, including public consultations by the Nuffield Council on Bioethics, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority and the Department of Health, and representations by scientists and key organisations such as the

2015 Richard Dimbleby Lecture
from the Information Age gallery at the Science Museum. This is an excerpt from her speech.,We need a new national institution to lead an ambitious charge – to make us the most digital nation on the planet.,I don’t say this because I’m a fan of institutions. I say this because the values of the internet have always been a dialogue between private companies and public bodies. And right now the civic, public, non-commercial side of the equation needs a boost. It needs more weight.,We have an opportunity to make Britain brilliant at digital. We’ve been going too slow, being too incremental – in skills, in infrastructure, in public services. We need to be bolder.,,A new institution could be the catalyst we need to shape the world we want to live in and Britain’s role in that world. Today, we’re letting big commercial technology platforms shape much of our digital lives, dominating the debate about everything from online privacy to how we build smart cities.,In fact, I probably wouldn’t call it an institution at all. This is no normal public body.,It’s time to balance the world of dot com so I would create DOT EVERYONE.,I would prioritise three areas, that I think best demonstrate the opportunities we should be grabbing with both hands: education, women and ethics.,Firstly, DOT EVERYONE has to help educate all of us, from all walks of life, about the internet. The internet is the organising principle of our age, touching all our lives, every day. As the late activist Aaron Swartz put it,
“It’s not OK not to understand the Internet anymore”
.,We need to make sure that those in power understand how the internet can help us redefine public services, improve the lives of the most vulnerable, bolster our economy. Leaders and legislators cannot lay claim to grasping the power and potential of the internet just because they’re on Twitter.,Crucially, we must ensure that no one is left behind; that the 10 million adults who can’t enjoy the benefits of being online because they lack basic digital skills, no longer miss out.,Secondly, DOT EVERYONE must put women at the heart of the technology sector. Currently there are fewer women in the digital sector than there are in Parliament.,Something that is for everyone should be built by everyone. Do you think that social media platforms would have done more to stop abuse if they had more women in senior positions? I do. And how about the Apple Health Kit that went to market without anything to do with periods? Building an awesome cohort of female coders, designers, creators would help make us the most digitally successful country on the planet and give us a real edge.,Finally, we should aim for a much more ambitious global role in unpicking the complex moral and ethical issues that the internet presents. For example, what are the implications of an internet embedded in your home appliances? Do children need online rights? What is an acceptable use of drones?,Our rule of law is respected the world over; we should be world-leading in answering these questions.,DOT EVERYONE is new – it won’t and shouldn’t feel familiar. No grey suits, no dusty buildings. It will be an independent organisation. It will have a strong mandate from government, but also from the public – we will be setting its agenda, we will be informing it and taking part in it. It might produce written reports but it would also prototype services. It should show what is possible when you put the internet at the heart of design.,We should be making sure that the original promises of the internet – openness, transparency, freedom and universality – are a protected national asset, as integral to our soft power as Adele, JK Rowling, Shakespeare, or even Downton Abbey.,Britain invented the BBC, the NHS – let’s not have a poverty of ambition – we can and should be inventing the definitive public institution for our digital age.,You can find out more about

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/richard-liebreichs-atlas-of-ophthalmoscopy/,Jack Mitchell,Richard Liebreich’s Atlas of Ophthalmoscopy,Assistant Curator Jack Mitchell explores how the Atlas of Ophthalmoscopy helped increase our understanding of the human eye,Collections and Objects,"charles babbage,medicine","During the middle decade of the nineteenth century, the inner workings of the human eye were explored for the first time thanks to the invention of the ophthalmoscope.
The Atlas of Ophthalmoscopy
by Richard Liebreich offered the medical profession the means to understand a living retina.,Liebreich’s book simultaneously championed and harnessed the technological development of the ophthalmoscope, while also offering a brilliant guidebook for the identification and treatment of fundus disease. A third edition of this 1863 publication is on display in the Science Museum’s
Glimpses of Medical History
gallery.,Richard Liebreich, who was born in Konigsberg, Germany in 1830, was able to work with some of the main protagonists in the development of modern ophthalmology. The second half of the nineteenth century saw significant changes in how ophthalmological medicine was understood, with many of these changes taking place in Germany. As a consequence of this, Germany is still regarded as a centre of ophthalmological research excellence to this day.,Liebreich worked as
Hermann Helmholtz
’s assistant, who in 1851 invented the first ophthalmoscope capable of viewing the internal workings of human eyes. British engineer and mathematician,
Charles Babbage
is recognised in some quarters for inventing the ophthalmoscope in 1847.,However, his failure to promote the discovery ensured that the majority of credit was passed to Helmholtz. Liebreich also worked as the assistant of famed ophthalmologist
Albrecht von Graefe
between the years of 1854 and 1862, and during this time also devised his
own ophthalmoscope
that improved upon Helmholtz’s original design.,Liebreich’s Atlas of Ophthalmoscopy was dedicated to Helmholtz and Von Graefe, and contained 57 colour drawings of the eye. Liebreich benefitted from being an incredibly skilled artist, and it was this ability which underpinned the success of his Atlas. The founder of the Royal Eye Hospital in London, John Zachariah Laurence, described the images contained within the Atlas as “scrupulous copies of nature”.,,The great quality of the Atlas was that it mapped and recorded the inner workings of the eye, successfully combining technological improvements with medical understanding. The Atlas gave doctors around the world beautifully comprehensive comparisons between healthy and diseased retinas, as well as demonstrating the appearance of certain optical conditions.,Liebreich’s Atlas vividly depicted the inner eye nearly twenty years before accurate photography was possible, and as such made significant contributions to the burgeoning discipline of scientific ophthalmology.,The Atlas had worldwide reach and influence. It was originally published simultaneously in French and German, but soon after versions appeared in both Spanish and English. The third edition currently on display in the museum is from 1885.,Liebreich’s work ensured that he was a respected figure within nineteenth century ophthalmology and in 1870 he was offered a significant role at the newly opened
St Thomas’s Hospital
in London.,The
Lancet
opposed his appointment because they felt it was “a gratuitous and unwarrantable insult to English ophthalmologists”.
The Medical Times and Gazette
defended Liebreich, insisting that his close associations with the German school were to be of huge importance to the fledgling hospital. They reasoned that in order to advance St. Thomas’s, and English ophthalmology in general, they had to “begin by assimilating all that Germany” (and hence Liebreich) had to teach.,Upon leaving his post at St Thomas’s Hospital in 1878 Liebreich slowly withdrew himself from the influential central spheres of ophthalmological medicine, focusing his energies instead on the impact optical disease had on the paintings of artists such as
J.M.W Turner.
He died in Sicily in 1917 having contributed significantly to the previous centuries advancements in the study of ophthalmology."

Atmosphere
, our climate science gallery which provides our visitors with accurate, up-to-date information on what is known, what is uncertain, and what is not known about this important subject. The gallery has been hugely popular since it opened four years ago and has now been visited by more than 3 million people.,As with all of our exhibitions and curatorial programmes, the editorial vision and control sits with our curatorial team.,The campaigners say emails between Shell and our fundraising team, which we shared in response to a Freedom of Information request, suggest that Shell was seeking to influence the direction of Atmosphere and the associated curatorial programme. Having spoken to our curatorial team, I can confirm that not a single change to the curatorial programme resulted from these email exchanges.,I know some people will have a broader disagreement with our decision to form partnerships with corporations such as Shell. I respect their right to hold that opinion but I fundamentally disagree. And it’s not just because external funding is vital in enabling us to remain free to millions of visitors each year and in allowing us to curate ground-breaking temporary exhibitions at a time when Government funding is declining. More importantly it’s because when it comes to the major challenges facing our society, from climate change to inspiring the next generation of engineers, we need to be engaging with all the key players including governments, industry and the public, not hiding away in a comfortable ivory tower.,In the case of our Atmosphere gallery, the Science Museum invited Shell’s Group Climate Change Advisor David Hone to sit on an advisory panel alongside people such as Tony Juniper, the former Executive Director of Friends of the Earth. We knew that decision wouldn’t please everyone, but we wanted to hear all sides of the debate and we’re proud of Atmosphere and the role the gallery and accompanying programme have played in raising awareness of climate change among visitors to the Science Museum.,Ian Blatchford is Director of the Science Museum Group."

Cosmonauts exhibition
.,There is hope that we’ll be sending people to Mars for real in the next few decades – but when they go, will they be ready for the journey?,In October 2014, six people went into a dome on the side of a volcano. They spent the next eight months re-creating a mission to Mars: they didn’t see any other people, ate freeze-dried food and had to wear spacesuits to go outside.,Martha Lenio is a Canadian engineer, commander of the
NASA HI-SEAS
simulated Mars mission and my good friend. While she was in the dome, we could only communicate by e‑mail and send voice messages that were delayed 40 minutes (as though they were going to Mars and back). Last week she came to visit and we took a trip to the Mars Rover test site to talk about her adventure.,Martha mentioned that she was applying for a simulated mission to Mars on the day that applications closed. A few months later she was heading to Wyoming as one of the finalists for the mission. A short camping trip was the only chance the crew had to get to know each other before flying to Hawaii to spend eight months living together in a dome about half the size of a tennis court.,During the camping trip, Martha was chosen as commander of the mission and is now only the third woman to command a NASA mission of any kind. The other members of the team took on different roles through the course of the mission and everyone was performing experiments similar to those that would run on a real Mars mission.,Far from having nothing to do, all the crew members were kept busy working on their experiments. Martha herself was testing how to grow plants indoors under LED lights. Even after losing a crop of lettuce to white mites (which wouldn’t happen on real Mars), she grew enough to make a few salads – a welcome change from eating only freeze-dried food.,While the team were in the dome, I asked Martha what she missed most from the outside world. The whole crew missed their families, particularly at Christmas and on birthdays. Martha especially missed the outside world – feeling the sun and wind on her skin. And many crew members felt isolated without access to social media or the internet.,However, the really big change was living so closely together. Even though they were isolated from the rest of the world, there was very little privacy within the dome. I asked Martha if that made it difficult to maintain good relationships. Her answer was typically diplomatic: ‘Really, it’s just the same as normal life. Stuff happens and you deal with it – except you’re in a dome and you can’t leave.’,Martha grew up in a big family, so sharing a small space with five other people wasn’t a big shock for her. Even so, the whole crew had to adjust to their new living arrangements. Their tiny, wedge-shaped bedrooms were right next to each other and sound carries easily in the dome. Luckily, there were no loud snorers in the crew!,Martha, Jocelyn, Sophie, Allen, Neil and Zak are now ‘back on Earth’ and, amazingly, still friends. Of course, Martha is glad to be back with her family, but she has no regrets and would make the same decision again – though she wouldn’t go through the experience a second time unless it were a real mission to Mars.,As for a real trip to Mars, Martha would love to go, but only if she gets to come back. As she says: ‘I would want to share my experiences with people here. And I like Earth!’,Martha was interviewed by Mary Cavanagh, an Assistant Content Developer at the Science Museum."

Buzz Aldrin
and
Neil Armstrong
made their historic Apollo 11 moonwalk, becoming the first two humans to set foot on another world.,Yesterday Buzz visited the Science Museum’s
Cosmonauts
exhibition, which opens to the public on the 18 September and has at its heart the 3.5 ton Lunniy Korabl (“lunar ship”) – or LK-3.,The single cosmonaut moon lander was built by the USSR in the same year that Apollo 11 took Buzz into the history books and was
moved to the museum
earlier this year for our landmark exhibition.,Would Buzz have liked to have used an LK-3 to land on the moon? He gave me an emphatic ‘no.’,The same engine was used for both descent and ascent from the moon while the American moon lander – a copy of which Buzz inspected in the museum, along with
Apollo 10
– used two separate engines. If the Soviet landing engine failed ‘they were splattered.’,One other key design difference was the lack of a tunnel to link the lander to the orbiting Soviet ‘mother ship’, the LOK (lunar orbiting cabin). By comparison, Apollo’s lander was connected by a tunnel to the Lunar Excursion Module after docking (Aldrin himself had helped devise procedures for docking in the Gemini 12 mission).,To use the LK-3, a cosmonaut would have to leave the ship and spacewalk to the lander, letting himself in by the lander’s oval hatch.,The Soviet moon lander was intended to be launched using the behemoth N1 rocket. But all four test-flights of the N1 launcher had ended in failure. While some earlier unmanned LKs were launched into Earth Orbit, none was launched towards the Moon.,Aldrin recounted how he was training for
Apollo 11
around a month before the launch, when the news of the failure reached America. ‘Someone open the training Command Module door and asked: “Do you need another month of study, of preparation?”,He knew the N1 failure was a major setback for the rival Soviet programme. ‘We talked about it and said, no, we were ready to go.”,Buzz told me he was aware of Soviet unmanned circumlunar missions, known as
Zond
, but knew that America was ahead of its rivals in December 1968 with the launch of
Apollo 8
, the first manned spacecraft to leave Earth orbit, reach the Earth’s Moon, orbit it and return safely to Earth.,He was impressed by some aspects of the rockets developed by the Soviet Union’s Chief Designer, Sergei Korolev, but it was clear from his replies that the spirit of the space race was still alive.,Buzz was ambivalent about US support for Russian space efforts and when it comes to Russian plans for Mars, he said diplomatically that he wanted to find out more (Buzz is visiting the UK to promote his children’s book “
Welcome to Mars
”).,According to Buzz, the Cosmonauts exhibition shows the story of a ‘competitor that lost’.,But, of course, he was referring to the race to the moon. When it comes to the first humans in space, the
Soviet Union led the way
. ‘We had a programme laid out and we just let them do what they want,’ said Aldrin.,When he arrived at the Science Museum, Buzz was greeted by the Director, Ian Blatchford; Chair of the Board of Trustees, Dame Mary Archer; Trustee and former Science Minister, David Willetts; and Ed Vaizey, Minister of State for Culture, Communications and Creative Industries.,He was accompanied around Cosmonauts by his son Andy Aldrin, space executive and expert on Soviet space endeavour, and by Deputy Keeper, Doug Millard.,Earlier this year,
Alexei Leonov
, who was being prepared to be the first Soviet cosmonaut on the moon, described how he had watched Apollo 11’s launch from a facility in Moscow.,Disappointed, though united by the
Cosmists vision of human space exploration
, he kept his fingers crossed for his astronaut comrades, he said.,But the Soviet lunar dream officially ended in 1974. Their programme had been starved of money compared with Apollo and was dogged by political infighting.,The Soviet Union pursued manned and unmanned programmes, dissipating scarce resources, and lost momentum, not least when Korolev died in 1966.,One could sense Leonov’s frustration with how close they had come when
he told an audience
in the Science Museum how ‘six spacecraft orbited the moon without a man on board.’,Cosmonauts: Birth of the Space Age
is open from 18 September 2015 – 13 March 2016. The exhibition is supported by BP and has additional support from ART RUSSE (Major Funder) and the Blavatnik Family Foundation."
https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/the-power-station-in-a-mountain/,Oliver Carpenter,The power station in a mountain,,Collections and Objects,"energy,engineering","How about this for a sound business proposition? You spend £25 million excavating a 1‑kilometre tunnel and a cavern the size of the
Royal Albert Hall
deep inside a solid-rock mountain. At the same time you create an artificial reservoir with the capacity of 4000 Olympic swimming pools way up high on a barren Scottish mountainside.,Then you install four giant turbines inside the mountain so that the water from the reservoir can flow through and generate electricity for the national grid. The result of all your hard work and expense is a hidden hydroelectric power station that actually consumes more electricity than it produces.,Well, that’s exactly what the people behind the
Cruachan dam and power station
did… and it’s still working for us, 50 years later.,Originally devised by British engineer Edward McColl, Cruachan was the first high-head reversible pumped-storage hydroelectric power station in the world. Water stored behind the dam in the high-level reservoir has potential energy.,When electricity is needed, the water flows into pipes, creating kinetic energy, and rotates four
Francis turbines
connected to generators, producing up to 440 MW of electrical energy.,The water is then released into one of Scotland’s most inspiring sites of natural beauty, Loch Awe, 390 metres below the reservoir. The pumps that transfer water back up to the dam are the same turbine blades spun in reverse and powered by electricity from the National Grid.,Opened by HM The Queen on 15 October 1965, Cruachan is celebrating its 50th anniversary of storing energy ready for rapid generation of electricity when it’s required at peak demand.,As a story of technological achievement in 1960s British civil engineering, it ranks right up there with Sizewell A nuclear power station and the construction of the
M1 motorway
.,This is a story of ‘green’ power storage and production: there is no burning of fossil fuels in generating the electricity, no use of chemicals and no toxic waste, just clean water and the power of gravity. But how green is it really?,It takes more electricity to pump the water uphill than it produces on the way back down, and the energy the power station buys comes mostly from coal, gas and nuclear power stations (although the energy bought may not have been used otherwise, so this reduces waste). Also, the 200,000 tons of concrete used to construct the dam and the 220,000 cubic metres of rock excavated left behind their own huge carbon footprints.,As well as the environmental costs, the financial and personal costs during construction were significant: the project cost £25 million in 1965 and the lives of 36 men were sadly lost during the difficult process of construction. No matter how much they are hidden, the dam, administration block and 275 kV transmission lines inevitably leave their mark on this otherwise picturesque landscape.,As a business prospect, however, Cruachan makes sound financial sense. The power bought from the grid to run the pumps at night costs next to nothing. It is sold back when demand is at its highest and electricity at its most expensive, for example when people switch on their kettles after coming home from work. Buy low, sell high.,Importantly, no other commercial form of power generation can be brought on grid faster; the energy is ready, literally on tap. The generating units can be switched on from a standing start in less than two minutes, and from standby to fully operational takes less than 30 seconds. They can then be turned off instantly. In contrast, to do the same gas takes hours, coal takes days, and nuclear power stations run on cycles lasting one to two years.,The power station at Cruachan is an incredible feat of civil engineering and a monument to 1960s Scottish architecture. Deep in the heart of the mountain it can generate a whopping 7 GWh of electricity from its watery stores, so that we can all have access to instant electricity at times of peak demand, with minimal environmental impact. This week, the team at the Cruachan power station are
rightly proud to be celebrating 50 years of operation
and some of the best of British innovation and ingenuity.,Dr Oliver Carpenter is the Associate Curator for Infrastructure and the Built Environment."

Even before the war, Britain depended on a huge quantity of imported goods, including food. Enemy ships targeted incoming Allied merchant vessels sending their precious cargo to the depths of the Atlantic.  As various items became scarce, food consumption was rationed.,Winston Churchill
was keen, wherever possible, to limit austerity in the interests of morale. Even his scientific adviser, the teetotal Frederick Lindemann, was glad that the Ministry of Food undertook to provide the normal stocks of beer.,This period saw the rise of a small group of scientists whose experimental research helped ensure people had enough food to survive.,Pioneering studies assessed the impact of rationing and established a healthy balance of available foods. Nutritionists
Robert McCance
and
Elsie Widdowson
led this investigation. Their task was to see how far food produced in Britain could meet the needs of the population and how much shipping could be saved.,Both scientists were familiar with self-experimentation before the war, having explored the chemical make-up of food and its effect on human health. Their book,
The Composition of Foods
was first published in 1940 and became a standard work in the field of nutrition.,This task was no different. Funded by the
Medical Research Council
, McCance, Widdowson and a small group of volunteers drastically reduced their intake of food and drink to a level some considered ‘intolerable’.  Although wholemeal bread and potatoes were unrationed, each person was allowed the following quantities per week: 110g fat, 150g sugar, one egg, 110g cheese, 450g meat and fish combined and quarter of a pint of milk a day.,After enduring this diet for three months, the volunteers moved to the Lake District for the second stage of their experiment. In chilly December 1940, the team proved that by enduring gruelling climbs, hikes and bicycle rides, this basic diet could meet the nation’s health needs.,One of McCance and Widdowson’s most important findings was the risk of calcium deficiency from a diet low in dairy products. Their recommendation for fortifying bread with calcium carbonate (chalk) was met with criticism, but later made law.  McCance and Widdowson’s work was made public after the war with their book,
An Experimental Study of Rationing,
published in 1946.,The book shows that even in the hardships of McCance and Widdowson’s  experiment, they celebrated Christmas with a hearty meal as their ‘calorie intake was affected by comfort and good cheer’. There was a plum pudding made from ingredients saved from the previous week’s rations and McCance ate five large potatoes ‘more than he had ever eaten in one day before’. This may sound familiar, but he had cycled for 52 miles the day before!,As you tuck into your plate of turkey, pigs-in-blankets, roast potatoes and that token Brussels sprout, spare a thought for those intrepid nutritionists whose experiments ensured people had enough food on their tables during the Second World War.,Rachel Boon is the Content Developer for

Bell Telephone Laboratories
and the
Canadian Overseas Telecommunications Corporation
, the £12.5 million project took three years to complete. During this time the system was planned, manufactured and installed, which required developing new techniques for placing cable in deep waters.,Telegraph links between the UK and the USA had been in existence from the middle of the previous century, but 1927 saw the first commercial radiotelephone service between the two countries. Initially 2,000 calls per year were made across the Atlantic, but the cost was prohibitive – in 1928 the basic rate for calls to New York was £9 for just three minutes.,It was only with the development of new equipment, such as coaxial cables with polyethylene insulation, carrier frequency equipment and broadband submerged repeaters, that transatlantic telephony by cable could be realised. These new technologies were developed just before and during World War Two. One key Post Office input was the development of subsea repeaters which were robust and reliable enough for areas around the coast and mainland Europe.,Apart from the short shore ends, the whole of the transatlantic telephone cable was laid by the Post Office cable ship Monarch. It was the only such ship that was capable of carrying the 1,500 nautical miles of cable which had to be laid in one piece across the deepest part of the Atlantic, between Oban in Scotland and Clarenville, Newfoundland. The cable then crossed over the the Cabot Strait to Sydney Mines, Nova Scotia.,At the inaugural ceremony at  Lancaster House in London on 25 September 1956, the service was opened by the Postmaster General, who spoke to the Chairman of AT&T calling from New York, and to the Canadian Minister of Transport.,During its first year of service, TAT1 carried twice as many calls as the radio circuits had done in a year – about 220,000 calls between Britain and the United States, and 75,000 between Britain and Canada – generating £2 million to be shared between the three countries.,In 1956, the first transatlantic telephone cable was regarded as a major technological achievement, not least as a base for future research and improvements. It laid the path for further developments such as sophisticated digital fibre optic transatlantic cables, which can pass tens of thousands of calls simultaneously.,BT is excited to be Lead Principal Sponsor of the new Science Museum’s

Information Age
gallery.,If you needed to send a message to North America, you wouldn’t think twice about drafting an e-mail, hitting ‘send’ and your message arriving in the recipient’s inbox almost instantly.,In 1858, however, communications were much slower. In those days, a message would take up to 10 days to arrive. This was the time it took for a ship to travel across the Atlantic.,Things changed in the August of 1858, when the first message was sent via a transatlantic telegraph cable, which ran from the east coast of North America to the West Coast of Ireland. Messages could now be sent in a matter of minutes, dramatically changing the history of transatlantic communication.,Experimenters had been investigating batteries and electromagnetism to develop a communication system since the early 19
th
century. The first practical system was executed successfully in the UK by the partnership of
Charles Wheatstone
and
William Cooke
. They used an electrical current to deflect magnetic needles which could be made to point to letters on a backboard. By the time of the 1858 transatlantic cable, their system had been developed and widely adopted for railway signalling across Britain.,American experimenter
Samuel Morse
(of Morse code fame), was also working on developing telegraphy. His system used a single circuit to send an electric signal along a wire to a receiver at the other end. Instead of using needles indicating letters of the alphabet, Morse’s system used a code of dots and dashes to spell out words. Morse received funding to use this technology to set up a telegraph system between Washington and Maryland in the USA. The telegraph became an instant success. People relished the ability to send and receive information much more quickly than before, and as a result the telegraph system expanded across America and Europe.,Soon after, in 1856, the
Atlantic Telegraph Company
was set-up with the objective of laying a cable across the Atlantic Ocean, connecting America with Europe. Luckily, opinions of the technology were high, which meant shares in the company sold quickly. As soon as enough money was raised, the first transatlantic cable, consisting of seven copper wires and recorded as weighing one ton per nautical mile, was laid from America to Ireland.,Queen Victoria
sent the first official transatlantic telegram. She sent a message to US president
James Buchanan
congratulating him ‘upon the successful completion of this great international work.’  The message travelled through 2,500 miles of cable and took 16 hours, a dramatic improvement on the 10 days it would have taken beforehand. The same message was repeated back to Valencia in Ireland in only 67 minutes.,Unfortunately, the success enjoyed by this first transatlantic cable did not last. There were problems with the cable, and within a month it had failed completely. However, the desire for speedy transatlantic communication was great enough to attract more funds to try again.  A further attempt in 1866 was successful.,The consequence of this new form of communication was huge. By the end of the 19
th
century, new technologies began to emerge. The telegraph was replaced by telephony and these days we rely on the internet for high speed communication. However, the telegraph was the first technology that allowed us to communicate quickly and reliably over long distances, and acted as a turning point in communication history.,You can explore more about the laying of the first transatlantic cable in our

Vostok-6
thundered off into space, joining Vostok-5 in orbit. Shortly afterwards, the commander of Vostok-6 could be heard excitedly calling out over the radio:,“Ya Chaika, Ya Chaika [I am Seagull]! I see the horizon […] This is the Earth; how beautiful it is. Everything goes well.”,26-year-old
Valentina Tereshkova
from the Soviet Union had just made history by becoming the first woman in space.,Tereshkova became an instant celebrity as images of her on board Vostok-6 were transmitted to Earth. In fact, due to the mission being shrouded in secrecy, Tereshkova’s own mother only found out about her daughter going to space when seeing the television broadcast.,Returning to Earth after 2 days, 22 hours and 50 minutes in orbit, Tereshkova was feted as a heroine. Her spacecraft, kept for posterity, will be displayed in the exhibition
Cosmonauts: Birth of the Space Age
which opens at the Science Museum in November 2014.,The mission was not a
flawless success
but this was hushed up by Soviet leaders who recognised her propaganda value. Joining a small group of flown cosmonauts, Tereshkova soon travelled the world as a cultural ambassador and political spokeswoman.,Within the Soviet Union the cosmonauts were idealised as heroes of a new era that the population should seek to emulate, while abroad they became the public face of the regime. Consequently their schedules were gruelling, and their image and behaviour carefully controlled; private lives ceased to be private.,Like the
first man in space
, Yuri Gagarin, Tereshkova wanted to fly again but was considered too important as a propaganda tool. Gagarin and Tereshkova’s value partly lay in qualities identified already at their initial selection; both came from modest backgrounds, were diligent students, model workers, politically loyal and personable. They were now celebrated as the communist dream come true.,Tereshkova’s public image differed from Gagarin’s however and was strictly gendered. While Gagarin was portrayed as a military hero in uniform, Tereshkova was shown with immaculate hair and make-up, wearing feminine dresses and high heels. In this way she came to embody the civilian, peaceful aspect of space travel.,In the early 1960s Soviet women were also encouraged to combine good work ethics and political commitment with femininity and a sense of style. Official accounts of Tereshkova consequently tried to reconcile her aptitude for science and technology with being feminine and chic.  To quote
R.P. Sylvester
, “[…] drab was out and Dior was most definitely in”.,While Tereshkova’s accomplishment was held by many as living proof of gender equality under Communism, it soon became apparent that there was a lack of real commitment to continued female participation on the Soviet space program. Not until 1982 would another woman make it into orbit.,Over 50 years after her own space flight, Valentina Tereshkova describes it as the most bright and wonderful experience of her life, and maintains that
given the opportunity
she would fly into space again.,Ulrika Danielsson,

the collection
it is easy to think about fires, floods and theft. However, hungry little creatures can be just as devastating for our objects.,Don’t judge them by their size, small insect pests are actually one of the ten primary agents of deterioration that can cause irreversible damage to objects in museum collections.,As a Collections Care Conservator at the Science Museum stores in Blythe House, a fascinating part of my job is keeping these insects at bay.,In the past, museum collections with materials vulnerable to pests – such as textiles, wood, paper, and feathers – would fumigate their collections with a variety of pesticides. That would stop insects from attacking the collections, but unfortunately would also be extremely harmful to humans.,Nowadays, a crucial part of pest management is monitoring. It is essential to do regular checks of the stores and have a general idea of the insect populations. We must spot any areas of concern and stop the pests before it’s too late.,In order to do this, we place many insect traps throughout our stores. We use two types of insect traps: sticky traps, which insects get stuck to as they pass; and pheromone traps that attract and trick male moths looking for a nice smelling mate. You might have seen some of these traps around museums.,Identifying these little creatures can be quite fun, yet often challenging, as most of them are very small and often get destroyed in the traps themselves.,How do they get destroyed? (Turn away now insect lovers) Well, some poor creatures simply pull themselves apart as they walk through the traps, while others are found snacking on the unlucky guy stuck next to them. Often, we can only see half the insect, or a mass of various insects and arachnids together, which adds to the challenge of identifying them.,Even though adult insects are dangerous because they can reproduce, they don’t often eat our collection. It is their larvae that are more damaging; their ravenous hunger can be extremely destructive.,Whilst many insects aren’t directly harmful to our collections, they do tell us important information about environmental conditions in our stores. If we know, for example, that a specific insect thrives in particularly humid conditions, we can make assessments about those areas of the stores. We can also see which areas of the building are particularly easy for insects to enter.,Of course, it is impossible to prevent all insects from entering our stores. Our aim is to provide conditions that are not welcoming to pests: storage areas are kept at lower temperatures to stop insects thriving, and good hygiene and housekeeping are also crucial, as insects love messy, dark and undisturbed areas.,It is worth remembering that while pests can be a danger to our collections, there’s a lot of information we can learn from them too.,To meet some usual pest suspects, visit

announced
to the world’s media in the Science Museum’s IMAX at an event introduced by Director Ian Blatchford.,Peake, who is based in the European Astronaut Centre in Cologne, said  that he is ”absolutely delighted” and saw the mission as the culmination of everything he had worked for during his  career, though he admitted that he had misgivings about the disruption caused by moving his family – he has two young sons – to Houston.,However, he was not concerned about the risks of the mission, since his future career was ‘probably safer’ than past career as helicopter test pilot.,His tasks once in orbit will include helping to maintain the space station, operating its robotic arm and carrying out science experiments in
Esa’s Columbus laboratory module
, which is attached to the front of the 400-ton ISS complex.,Peake said that he hoped there would be space biomedicine experiments and that the UK scientific community would rise to the opportunities presented by microgravity experiments.,“Major Tim” told the press conference that in preparation for this challenge he had lived in a Sardinian cave for a week, flew on what is popularly known as a ‘
vomit comet

Previous UK-born individuals who have gone into orbit have done so either through the US space agency (Nasa) as American citizens or on independent ventures organised with the assistance of the Russian space agency.,Thomas Reiter
, a former astronaut and Director of ESA’s Directorate of Human Spaceflight and Operations, congratulated Peake ‘It is a remarkable moment for your country. You all can be proud of Timothy.’ And Dr David Parker of the UK Space Agency said nothing inspires like human explorers at the final frontier.,David Willetts, Minister for Universities and Science
, said that this mission is part of effort to rebalance the economy – the UK space industry is worth £9.1 billion to the economy – and pointed out that the space sector is growing by 8 per cent each year.,He added that the mission underlined the inspirational values of space – the ‘Apollo effect’ – and will encourage more young people to take up STEM (science, technology and maths) subjects at schools and universities. ‘I have high hopes it will interest a generation of students in science and technology.’,The minister said that the
objects in the Science Museum
are a reminder of the UK’s distinguished history in space exploration and that he is now looking into a competition for schools based on the mission to the ISS.,Prime Minister, David Cameron, commented:  “This is a momentous day, not just for Tim Peake but for Great Britain. Tim was picked for this historic role from over 8,000 applicants from around the world. I am sure he will do us proud.”,Helen Sharman

Science Museum
, our hotly-anticipated
Collider
objects were due to arrive from CERN.,8am. An hour on and the van was here. Evidently, good objects come to those who wait.,Maybe it was the fact we had been working with only object dimensions and tiny pictures, but the first sight of even just the crates, in their various sizes and shapes, suddenly made the exhibition feel all the more real and tangible.,Broadly there were two concerns. Was everything there? And how to shift a two-tonne superconducting dipole magnet, aka “the Beast”? Luckily, on hand to help with the latter was a forklift truck – naturally, delivered by a bigger truck.,Once the two-tonne Beast had been fork-lifted over to the Goods Lift (conveniently situated up a slope) there was the small matter of getting it in. At this stage, ascertaining whether everything had come relied on the skilful art of imagining which object might fit in which crate. Given the variety of objects, ranging from a 22-cm delicate crystal detector piece to a whopping 2-metre-long iron magnet, guessing according to the logic of packing was relatively straight forward.,Later, came the Christmas-esque joy of cracking open the crates and seeing the LHC treasures in the flesh. Looking at the cross-section cut of the dipole magnet, it was nice to see that even “the Beast” had a friendly face.,After the
museum conservators

In their research for our
Cosmonauts
exhibition, Science Museum curators traced the origins of the first great leap into space by
Yuri Gagarin
in 1961 to events that took place well before the turn of the 20th century.,Russian fascination with the cosmos first flickered into life in the 1880s with the appearance in print of the first translations of Western science fiction novels by French writers such as Camille
Flammarion
, Henri De Graffigny and
Jules Verne
– notably
De la terre à la lune
(
From the Earth to the Moon
), in which a cannon was used for a moon shot. Verne’s novel also inspired three gifted individuals, each working independently in different countries.,The first two,
Robert Goddard
, an American, and
Hermann Oberth
, born to German-speaking parents in Transylvania (now Romania), were professors of physics who subsequently developed the first liquid-propelled rocket and the first long-range ballistic missile, the
V-2
, respectively.,The third great architect of the space age was
Konstantin Tsiolkovsky
, a self-educated Russian polymath, now known as the grandfather of Soviet space travel. A crater on the far side of the moon is now named in his honour and, as well as featuring examples of his work and even one of his ear trumpets.
Cosmonauts: Birth of the Space Age
will open the day after his birthday, 17
th
September.,Tsiolkovsky wrote both science fiction and treatises on rocket propulsion. His article “The Investigation of Outer Space by Means of Rocket Devices”, published in 1903, introduced the idea of using liquid propellants as rocket fuel and also discussed weightlessness.,Though this marked the first mathematical explanation of how it would be possible to shake of the shackles of the Earth’s gravity to venture into space, the article made little impact. However, his follow up article in 1911 and
Aims of Astronauts
in 1914 aroused wider interest by discussing two key problems: rocket motors and interplanetary communication.,Unlike Goddard and Oberth,
Tsiolkovsky
never built an actual rocket. However, the cosmic vision depicted in his drawings, novels and scientific papers became hugely influential. Sergei Korolev, Chief Designer of the Russian space programme (whose portrait looms over the exhibition), later commented that Tsiolkovsky’s theory of multi-stage rockets – “rocket trains” – to all intents and purposes opened the path for humanity to get into space.,At the turn of the 20th century cosmism emerged in Russia, blending ideas from Western and Eastern philosophy along with those of the Russian Orthodox church to ponder the origin, evolution and future of the cosmos and humankind.,Perhaps the leading figure of this movement was
Nikolai Fedorov
, an advocate of radical life extension by means of scientific methods and of resurrection too – the exhibition includes his
Outline of the Image of a Universal Task of Resurrection
(around 1900) which depicts humanity’s duty to achieve immortality.,During that time at the end of the nineteenth century Tsiolkovsky conceived of a grandiose project: to set out key philosophical questions  “from a cosmic point of view”, not least how Earth could cope with immortal humans, publishing his ideas in the following decades. To cope with the burgeoning demands of Earth’s ever-growing population, he believed the future of humanity lay in the heavens. As he put it,,“The Earth is the cradle of humanity, but mankind cannot stay in the cradle.”,Tsiolkovsky argued that colonizing space would lead to the perfection of the human race.  He believed that humanity had every reason for “cosmic optimism”, since it was possible for human culture to develop without limits in the vastness of the cosmos. For Tsiokovsky the goal of space exploration was to achieve universal happiness.,Cosmic fascination was by then commonplace. Russians had been enthralled when the American
Percival Lovell
, who founded the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, speculated that the red planet was home to an advanced but now dead civilization that had constructed canals to transport water, in three books:
Mars
(1895),
Mars and Its Canals
(1906) and
Mars As the Abode of Life
(1908). (Today many scientists believe that Mars might have been able to support life, probably in the past
when it had oceans
, but that it most likely would have been microbial). In 1915, Yakov Perelman, the son of Russian Jewish intellectuals, wrote what was thought to be the first serious book on space travel,
Interplanetary Travel
.,The allure of the cosmos was amplified in the wake of the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the subsequent civil war that would see the ascendance of the Red Army, fighting for the Bolshevik brand of socialism. The new Bolshevik leaders of the Soviet Union fully embraced science and technology and there was a hunger for an optimistic vision of the future that transcended the horrors of the First World War.,By 1924, the media “seemed to have found a new craze: space travel”, comments Asif Siddiqi, a professor of history at Fordham University in New York. “The cosmos seemed to be everywhere,” he writes in
the book
to accompany the exhibition. “Prominent public figures gave talks to an enraptured public, enthusiasts joined together to discuss interplanetary flight, publishers issued books with fantastic illustrations, and a feature film on space exploration had just been released to theatres.”,Enthusiasts formed the first societies dedicated to space travel. Among them was the Society for the Study of Interplanetary Communications, formed in the spring of 1924 at the Zhukovsky Air Force Academy in Moscow and driven by Fridrikh Tsander, who in 1922 resigned from his job at a factory to design a space plane powered by a rocket engine that would make efficient use of melted aluminium from its fuselage as fuel. Tsander also analysed re-entry into the Earth’s atmosphere and landing.,Nikolai Rynin, a specialist in aeronautics who organised a similar society in Leningrad, wrote a nine-volume encyclopaedia,
Interplanetary Communications
, published between 1928 and 1932, which sought to bring together everything written in any language about space travel, including folk tales, medieval speculations, modern science fiction, and the most recent works of Tsiolkovsky, Goddard and Oberth (with Perelman, Rynin had written to both Goddard and Oberth asking them for the latest information on American and German advances in the field of astronautics).,Based on rumours of Goddard’s plans, the Soviet press began to speculate that the American was planning to launch a rocket to the Moon timed for 4 July 1924, US Independence Day. In early October, the Society held a widely advertised talk by a well-known astronomer on the topic of “The Truth about the Dispatching of Professor Goddard’s Projectile to the Moon”. The crowds outside were so unruly that the horse-borne Moscow militia was summoned to keep them under control.,Three years later, in the spring of 1927, the “World’s First Exhibition of Models of Interplanetary Equipment, Mechanisms, and Historical Materials” was held in Moscow, depicting the history of space travel, from the twilight in the 19th century to the ideas of Tsiolkovsky, Tsander, Goddard, Oberth and others. The show was a great success and can be regarded as the progenitor of all space exhibitions, including
Cosmonauts: Birth of the Space Age
.,But Tsiolkovsky had struggled after the Revolution, said Siddiqi. He was arrested by the secret police on charges of treason (and spent a brief time in prison) and ended up nearly destitute in the early 1920s. “When news of Goddard and Oberth’s writings reached the Soviet press, Tsiolkovsky, hurt by the negligence of ideas in his native nation, republished his works, claiming – entirely rightly – that he had pre-empted both of the foreigners by decades in predicting the reality of space travel.”,The exhibition shows sketches from
Tsiolkovsky’s
Album of Cosmic Journeys
(1932), prepared for the production of the film
The Cosmic Voyage
, which demonstrate the effects of weightlessness, how to store food in a rocket, airlocks and other details of spaceflight. They are strikingly prescient of the very first space missions.,By the mid-1930s, however, the space fad had been overshadowed by the growing fascination with the more realistic ambitions of aviation, such as jet propulsion.,Still, the Soviet space obsession of the interwar years paid handsome dividends. Most Russians were thrilled when the first artificial satellite, Sputnik, was launched in 1957 and Yuri Gagarin soared into the heavens in 1961 with a cry of “Let’s go!” Perhaps by then, in the wake of the cosmism fad, the first great leap into space by humans seemed almost inevitable.,Roger Highfield is Director of External Affairs at the Science Museum.,Cosmonauts: Birth of the Space Age
is open from 18 September 2015 – 13 March 2016. The exhibition is supported by BP and has additional support from ART RUSSE (Major Funder) and the Blavatnik Family Foundation."
https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/whats-happening-at-the-national-media-museum-is-a-fresh-start/,Dame Mary Archer,What’s happening at the National Media Museum is a fresh start,We are building a better museum. Bradford is one of the most remarkable cities in Britain and the National Media Museum is an important part of its bright future.,"Collections and Objects,Exhibitions and Galleries",,"by Dame Mary Archer, Chairman of the Board of Trustees, Science Museum Group,There is a striking statue of the great novelist and Bradfordian J B Priestley outside the National Media Museum, and we need his wisdom to understand the real story about the future of this Museum. The planned move of the Royal Photographic Society collection to the Victoria & Albert Museum has generated much heated comment and reignited understandable soul searching about the north-south divide. Yet Priestley himself remarked that he had ‘always been delighted at the prospect of a new day, a fresh try, one more start’, and that is precisely what is now dawning at the Museum.,The tale of loss, even of cultural vandalism, being put about by some is simply wrong. The Science Museum Group’s Board of Trustees has thought long and hard about the future of the National Media Museum and the reality is of a museum that is firmly rooted in its community with a major photographic collection (which will still include three million images), vibrant plans for new galleries and bold new programming that, despite the tough economic backdrop, is already arresting years of decline. It is a story of gains, confidence and ambition.,The National Media Museum is one of the great museums within the Science Museum Group. With four museums north of Liverpool, we have the most northerly centre of gravity of all the national museum groups, and have consistently backed this up with investment. Our Group founded the world`s greatest railway museum in York (the one that brought Flying Scotsman back to life), created a national museum in Bradford, rescued the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester when its future was in doubt, and worked with Durham County Council to create a railway museum in Shildon. We have bold plans for a new special exhibition gallery in Manchester and, to complement the huge York Central development, a bold new vision for the National Railway Museum. Moreover, about half of our staff live and work in a variety of northern towns and cities.,Within our museum Group, this year’s star performer has been the National Media Museum, with audiences up 11% on last year. So why has it broken a pattern of steady and ominous decline? It’s all about STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), notably moving the science of light, image and sound to centre stage in the museum since 2013. The increased focus on science is already working and reconnecting the Museum to the communities closest to it – the children, students and families of Bradford and West Yorkshire.,This fresh focus came after careful consultation and received strong public backing from key partners in the town: the University of Bradford, Bradford College and, crucially, Bradford Metropolitan District Council, which is investing £1 million in the Museum specifically for science education. The 2015 summer exhibition – Light Fantastic – offered a tantalising picture of the potential of Bradford’s premier cultural attraction, with impressive visitor numbers and a compelling new take on physics. Just last month the partnership with Horrible Science brought nearly 30,000 visitors to the Museum in nine days. People in Bradford are voting with their feet.,Our minds and money should be devoted to building on this success. That is why the move of the Royal Photographic Society (RPS) collection – around ten per cent of the Museum’s photography collections – to the Victoria & Albert Museum makes such sense. This collection contains extremely fragile and delicate negatives and prints which must be kept in carefully controlled environmental conditions. Its many archive boxes have scant connections with the city and region and they were visited by fewer than 500 researchers last year. The collection is truly great but in the past decade or so we have not been able to allocate sufficient resources to do it full justice.,We could have opted for a quiet life but decided to take a tough look at a question that few museums would dare to ask: is there a better home for this collection, given we cannot do everything we would like? We looked for somewhere with significant resources, expertise and reach, both nationally and internationally. The Victoria & Albert Museum has fantastic plans to create an international photography centre and a commitment to make more of the collection by working with the National Media Museum, as well as completely digitising it. The collection will be accessible in the V&A’s Study Rooms, which were visited by 35,000 people last year, and will join their programme of national tours: over the past decade they have toured 23 photographic exhibitions which have been seen by 1.5 million people across the country.,An important point that many observers have overlooked is that the RPS collection only headed to Bradford thirteen years ago because the Royal Photographic Society couldn’t afford to look after it properly in their headquarters in Bath. The transfer to London has been welcomed by Dr Michael Pritchard, Director-General of the Society, who told us he was ‘pleased we can further enhance the RPS Collection’s stature alongside the V&A’s own art photography collection and make it more widely available to the public and scholars …,The RPS is extremely fortunate to benefit from the support and expertise of one of the world’s most revered cultural institutions.” Moreover, as the RPS itself pointed out, the move represents a homecoming and reunion for some of these images, which were once part of a single collection at the 19th century South Kensington Museum before it divided into the V&A and the Science Museum. On learning of the proposed transfer in early December last year, Michael put on record some expectations such as maintaining commitments over access, ongoing digitisation and that the collection would remain a distinct entity, intellectually and physically – areas all addressed through the V&A’s plans. ‘Assuming agreement on those points,’ he said ‘the RPS offered its support for the transfer as being in the best interests of the RPS collection’.,The National Media Museum still faces challenges, among them a name that has never connected with existing and potential audiences. This is why the Group has committed to supporting the museum, by raising £7.5 million over a five-year period to fund a new interactive gallery, an innovative sphere on which to display the latest satellite imagery, and new galleries filled with its most extraordinary collections of film, animation, TV and photographic technology. Glorious collections will move from the basement stores to public display. These are gains for the public.,And there is more. The science focus is proving so fruitful that the Group will move prize items of key cultural importance (including landmark technology by Herschel, Marconi and Wheatstone) from London to be displayed in the new galleries. We are also committed to working with a wide range of partners to develop new festivals and support the cultural life of the region.,Our Bradford museum is not a ‘satellite’ of our Group, as some have put it, but an equal partner. To underline this, the Board of Trustees had its latest strategy meeting in Bradford and, only last week, the Group held its biggest annual gathering of staff in the museum and adjoining council offices.,To conclude, we are building a better museum, one that will remain a cultural powerhouse. Bradford is one of the most surprising cities in Britain and the National Media Museum will be a key supporter of its culturally rich, diverse and youthful future."

Srinivasa Ramanujan
, the autodidact genius who died tragically young, is one of the most inspirational in all of mathematics.,It will reach the big screen when
The Man Who Knew Infinity
is shown in cinemas at the end of this week, as the Science Museum prepares a bold
new gallery on mathematics
in London, designed by
Zaha Hadid
, along with exhibits next year about science and technology in the Indian subcontinent.,Ramanujan (born 22 December 1887) was raised in Southern India and, as a result of his profound intuition about mathematical patterns, the then clerk at the Accountant-General’s office at the Madras Port Trust Office was invited to
Trinity College, Cambridge
.,There the eminent British mathematician
Godfrey Harold (G. H.) Hardy
and his collaborator
John E. Littlewood
, recognised the raw talent of Ramanujan’s work, which he had recorded in notebooks and tried to capture in a letter to Hardy.,The movie depicts the clash of approaches between methodical Hardy, who demanded proofs based on close reasoning, and the intuitive approach of Ramanujan, who claimed his ideas were dispensed by his family deity.,However, Ramanujan went on to become the first Indian Fellow both of Trinity and of the
Royal Society
, the world’s oldest learned society, which hosted a screening earlier this week of the film, directed by Matthew Brown.,Hardy once quoted Littlewood as saying that ‘Every positive integer was one of [Ramanujan’s] personal friends.’,The film shows perhaps the most famous anecdote about Ramanujan’s visceral grasp of mathematics. Hardy took a cab to visit Ramanujan and had remarked that the number of his cab, 1,729, was uninteresting. Ramanujan replied that, to the contrary, it was the smallest number expressible as a sum of two cubes in two distinct ways.,Today, it is often called the taxi-cab number (for example, in the Science Museum’s event on
maths and The Simpsons
).,Ramanujan had suffered episodes of illness throughout his life and the rigours of his lifestyle in England during the First World War, combined with the strict vegetarianism of his Brahmin caste, eventually led to a decline in his health. In 1917 Ramanujan was hospitalised in London.,He was thought to have tuberculosis, and had made a failed suicide attempt, when he threw himself under a train. After around five years in Cambridge, Ramanujan returned to Madras in 1919, a sick man, and died shortly after, on 26 April 1920.,‘Every child who grows up in India knows Ramanujan, in the same way that every British child knows about Darwin or Newton,’ said the Indian-born president of the
Royal Society
, Sir Venki Ramakrishnan, a Nobel prize winning molecular biologist.,‘I realised with some pleasure that I would be the president on the centenary of his lecture to the Royal Society, and I thought something ought to be done about it.’,Through Trinity College, Sir Venki’s own college, he was put in touch with Ken Ono, the Asa Griggs Candler Professor of Mathematics at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, and a Ramanujan scholar, who had consulted on the movie (Ono told the Society the film was a ‘passion project’),Sir Venki said he was struck by what he called ‘a rather romantic story’, the fact that Ramanujan had connected with Hardy at all. ‘There were people who transcended the prejudices of their time and reached out,’ said Sir Venki. ‘It is a lesson to all of us. We don’t know where genius can spring from. We should keep our minds and our hearts open.’,Nobel prize winning astronomer Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar has also
described
how Ramanujan’s success had boosted the confidence of the founders of modern India including Jawaharlal Nehru, who became the first Prime Minister in 1947.,In 2012 on the 125th anniversary of Ramanujan’s birth, the
Notices of the American Mathematical Society
published articles on his work. Most remarkable, the studies he conducted after returning to India, contained in what is now known as the ’Lost Notebook’, have only recently been interpreted. Ramanujan’s ‘mock’ theta functions are now used in the
study of black holes
.,Ono remarked: ‘we are still finding new applications all over mathematics, all over science that we wouldn’t really have imagined ten years ago; the legend of Ramanujan is mysterious at every level.’,In the movie, Hardy is played by Jeremy Irons and Littlewood by Toby Jones. Stephen Fry is Sir Francis Spring, who was an early advocate of Ramanujan in India, and Dev Patel is Ramanujan.,Patel told the Royal Society that the film was a ‘labour of love… over 10 years in the making. It is a difficult sell. There is no action or adventures. It is an intellectual piece about two men coming together for their art.’,‘Ramanujan was very religious and thought mathematics was like painting without colours; he believed every equation was an expression of God,’ said Patel. ‘Hardy, on the other hand, was an atheist and believed in the practical way of doing proofs to explain theorems and this is what he tried to instil in Ramanujan.,When a film does not rely on CGI or special effects, it’s performance driven and I thought a story about two humans with drastically different ideals would be an amazing journey to go on. It turned out to be just that.’,Roger Highfield is Director of External Affairs at the Science Museum and attended a Royal Society screening of The Man Who Knew Infinity."

You might have noticed the girl’s boots raised off the floor. The faces and the boots are the biggest clues to the children’s age. From these clues, you would see that they are young. On the other hand, if we asked you to tell us how wealthy you think the family are, the best clues are probably not going to be the children’s faces; you would probably look at the more material possessions, such as the expensive-looking chair.,Your visual brain can process all this information effortlessly, and in milliseconds. In fact, your brain controls almost everything you do. If your brain is injured in some way, or if someone develops a brain disease, it can lead to difficulties in thinking skills. Depending on the areas of the brain that are damaged or diseased, these difficulties can be very specific (for example, a difficulty recognising faces) or broad (for example, speaking, understanding and socialising with people).,Lots of studies show that the way a person moves their eyes around an image can tell us about how they are thinking. If we can map where you move your eyes around an image like the one above, this would be a good way to test thinking skills like understanding a question (language) and how accurate your perception is – all without you saying a word!,We are taking this idea one step further, and developing a test where there are no instructions at all. This will make it easier for people with brain damage and disease to show us their thinking skills. All we ask people to do is to watch a series of dots, images and words.,Here is a map we created to show you how one of our researchers moved their eyes around the screen when they saw this image for a few seconds.,,The colours show the areas they were interested in when looking at the picture. Red shows the area of most interest, cooling down to green where they briefly moved their eyes around.  You will notice that they have not looked everywhere in the picture, but have focused mainly on the people’s faces (particularly around the girl’s eyes), and the two cups they are holding.,Even though we are all very different, healthy people do tend to look around certain images in the same way. But we can’t just assume that people will look at our images in the test in the same way – we have to prove it. This is why we are
running our experiment
at the Science Museum. We need volunteers to show us how they move their eyes around this set of images in particular. Once we collect enough data from healthy volunteers on our images, we can work out what is ‘typical’.,Then we will go back to the Dementia Research Centre, and show exactly the same images to people with a dementia diagnosis. Depending on how early they are in their diagnosis, people with dementia might still move their eyes around the images in some ways very much like other healthy adults. In other ways, they might move their eyes differently. These differences are going to be be very important for us to work out, because in the future, we could use them to establish ways of working out if someone might have a brain disease or not.,If you are interested in helping us, please visit us at Live Science, in the Who Am I? gallery.

If we do not crack this problem, we risk returning to the pre-antibiotic era, when infectious diseases were responsible for around 40% of all deaths.","At the Museum,Science in the news","antibiotics,medicine","Edited speech by Dame Sally Davies, Chief Medical Officer for England, member of the Longitude Committee and co-chair of the
Longitude Prize
Advisory Panel, on the announcement of the
Discovery Awards
, seed funding for new diagnostic tests, in the Science Museum.,,Antimicrobial resistance is an issue that we are all facing now. If we do not crack this problem, we risk returning to the pre-antibiotic era, when infectious diseases were responsible for around 40% of all deaths. Looking ahead twenty years, we could face a situation where any one of us could go into hospital for minor surgery and die because we get an infection that cannot be treated by antibiotics. Routine operations like hip replacements or organ transplants could become deadly too because of the risk of infection.,This catastrophic threat has come about due to lack of understanding about when to use antibiotics – all too often, antibiotics are used inappropriately in human and animal health, aquaculture, agriculture and in the environment. For example, antibiotics are misused in agriculture, where many farmers will not even know that the feed they buy contains antibiotics, or what the implications of this are.,Globally, they have come to be seen as a wonder drug for many years and people have got in to the habit or prescribing them ‘just in case’. As a result, patients have come to expect an antibiotic for any infection — and put pressure on doctors, and vets, to prescribe them. They can feel that this validates their illness, even though they only fight bacteria, not viruses that are responsible for so many other infections.,Recently, a study found that nearly a third of antibiotics prescribed by doctors in the United States are not needed — this translates to about 47 million unnecessary prescriptions given out each year. The main reason is they are being prescribed for conditions that do not respond to antibiotics, such as colds, sore throats, bronchitis, flu and other viral infections. Only 10% of sore throats benefit from antibiotic treatment, but the prescription rates are commonly as high as 60%. Many antibiotics are thus prescribed unnecessarily.,This has spurred the evolution of resistant bacteria, which was tolerable in the 60s, 70s and 80s when pharma companies were finding and developing lots of antimicrobial drugs. But now the ‘low hanging fruit’ has been taken and R&D has become much more difficult, meaning we cannot just open the medicine cabinet to get out the next antibiotic when resistance develops.,We are now seeing infections which have multi-drug resistance — resistance to more than one of the antibiotics that doctors would normally prescribe. We are also starting to see extreme drug resistance, where the infection is resistance to all of the drugs that we have. We are seeing cases of this when it comes to tuberculosis in London, right now.,There is much we can do in terms of prevention and that means basic sanitation and hygiene and a greater use of vaccines in humans and animals. There is much we can do to control misuse of these precious drugs too. Globally, guidelines on the use of antibiotics are not implemented and the absence of regulation in many countries means that as many as 50% of antibiotics are dispensed without a prescription.,However, it is not all about restricting access to antibiotics. At the moment, more people die of lack of access to antimicrobials, not because of resistant infections. Moreover, by one estimate, 25% of all counterfeit drugs are antibiotics.,Any solution needs to ensure the appropriate use of antibiotics and rapid diagnostics – the aim of the new Longitude Prize – will help immensely with this.  What we desperately need is quick, effective diagnostics, which can be used in any setting to determine, at the most basic level, if an infection is bacterial or viral.,Even better would be for the diagnostic to provide information on which drug would be most effective – but I will take the simple bacterial/viral diagnostic at this point. That is why I first suggested antimicrobial resistance, or AMR, and the development of a rapid diagnostic, should be the subject of the Longitude Prize.,The important contribution of rapid diagnostics in the fight against AMR has also been recognised by
Lord O’Neill
in his independent international review on antimicrobial resistance. He will be publishing his final report later this week, and rapid diagnostics will form a key part of his recommendations.,Point of care diagnostics, as being searched for by the Longitude Prize, have a key role to improve the stewardship of existing and new drugs, and to challenge, and help influence, some of the bad behaviours through providing an evidence base for decision making by health workers and patients.,,For all of these reasons, it gives me great pleasure to be here tonight at the Science Museum, near the
Clockmakers’ Museum
where we can see the fifth marine chronometer of
John Harrison
, who cracked the original Longitude challenge, to launch and open the
Discovery Awards

These small sums will help teams who are hitting barriers that they cannot overcome with traditional funding – they are new to the field, unpublished, working on novel ideas, at very early stages of ideation, not able to access labs to carry out first stage testing and so on.,We also know that many teams with novel ideas are also working in new collaborations or for other reasons cannot access funding so this will help them come forward and register. The current pot for the prize is £200,000, for which we thank
GSK

BIRAC

",At the Museum,"live science,research,who am i","How do you spend your time? Do you play sports , read or hangout with friends?,Human beings are social creatures, and we tend to enjoy spending time with others. There are different kinds of social behaviour.,You have probably heard of antisocial behaviour – when people deliberately cause trouble for other people. You might be less familiar with the term prosocial, but hopefully you engage in prosocial behaviour more often.,Prosocial behaviour describes any act that is intended to help other people. For example, if you help someone carry something, give up your seat on the bus, or look after someone when they are ill, you are engaging in prosocial behaviour.,There are lots of reasons why we might be prosocial (and lots of reasons why we might be antisocial!), but we don’t really understand how age affects prosocial behaviour.

.,How did you become involved in robotic research?,Like many things in life there was a lot of luck involved. Although I have always been fascinated by robots I didn’t actively study them until I came to Bristol 20 years ago. I was lucky then because firstly I had a chance to set up a new research group, and secondly I met 2 other people who were also interested in robots. Together we started the robotics lab. We were also lucky because we managed to win the money (grants) to do robot research projects – without the funding the lab would have been very short lived.,Then, during the last 20 years my interest in robotics has changed, so that now I’m much more interested in basic scientific questions, like what is intelligence, how do animals evolve, how does culture emerge and so on, and use robots to try and answer (in a small way) those questions. So what makes me want to study robots now is a deep interest in some of the big questions of life.,What are swarm robots and what is it about them that fascinates you?,A robot swarm is a collection of relatively simple robots that interact with each other and the environment in ways that are inspired by the behaviour of social insects. Complex group behaviours, like flocking, foraging for food, or nest building can emerge from the micro-interactions of lots of individuals.,I’m fascinated by swarm robotics for two reasons. Firstly, future real-world applications for tasks as wide ranging as robotic agriculture, waste processing and recycling, search and rescue, or planetary exploration and colonisation are likely to use swarms of robots. And secondly, by building swarms of robots we can start to understand how the processes of emergence and self-organisation work, and how to engineer systems using these mechanisms.,Do you see a direct relationship between the swarm behaviour of robots and the herd like relationships of humans?,Yes, social insects (and the robots inspired by them) are not the only animals that show swarm intelligence. The flocking of birds, shoaling of fish and herding of mammals are all examples of the same kind of group behaviour. Humans are complicated, of course, but some aspects of human crowd behaviour are almost certainly swarm-like.,What are the ultimate goals and objectives attributed to swarm robotics?,The ultimate goal of swarm robotics is to be able to engineer safe and reliable robotic swarms for real-world applications. As I mentioned in the answer above there are many challenging real-world (and off-world) tasks that would benefit from a swarm robotics approach. Basically any task that is distributed in physical space, where it would be better to have multiple robots (than having just one robot).,Reaching this goal requires the solution of a number of difficult technical problems. One is how to design the behaviours of the individual robots so that when you put all the robots together in their working environment, they actually self-organise to complete the required task. The second challenge is how to design a human-swarm interface – in other words how would a human operator control and monitor a large swarm of robots. The third challenge is how to prove that the swarm of robots will always do the right thing, and never the wrong thing! And the final challenge is getting this all working in real-world applications so that people become confident in swarm robotics technology.,Our view of robots is shaped by books and film – do you think this is helpful or misleading?,Good question! I think robots in science fiction are both helpful and misleading. Helpful because many roboticists, myself included, were inspired by science fiction, and also because SF provides us with some great examples of ‘thought experiments’ for what future robots might perhaps be like – think of the movie AI, or Data from Star Trek. (Of course there are some terrible examples as well!),But robots in science fiction are misleading too. They have created an expectation of what robots are (or should be) like that means that many people are disappointed by real-world robots. This is a great shame because real-world robots are – in many ways – much more exciting than the fantasy robots in the movies. And the misleading impression of robots from SF makes being a roboticist harder, because we sometimes have to explain why robotics has ‘failed’ – which of course it hasn’t!"

.,How did you become involved in robotic research?,When I was at school I didn’t really know what I wanted to do with my life, so I chose to study Artificial Intelligence (at the University of Birmingham) because I didn’t really believe that it was a real subject. I quickly fell in love with the idea of building intelligent systems, so stayed in Birmingham to do a PhD in AI for video games. It was only a few years later when I joined an ambitious project that wanted to use some of the ideas from my PhD to help build a cognitive robot that I moved away from virtual worlds and built things that ran in the real world. From then on I was hooked on robotic research.,How did you become involved in using robots for exploration?,We were interested in studying how robots could automatically extend their own knowledge about their worlds. We already had a robot that could build maps of its environment, but it had to be directed by a human using a joystick. Therefore it seemed like a natural extension to see if we could get the robot to take over from the human and guide the exploration itself.,What can Dora do?,The Dora robot can explore space to build up a map. It can choose where to explore based on how likely it is that a particular direction of exploration will produce interesting results (like previously unknown rooms). Dora can also search for objects, either in order to tell a human where they are, or to work out what kind of rooms are in the building (e.g. if it sees a kettle it will realise it is in a kitchen). Dora can also interact with humans in a limited way, by asking questions about the location of objects.,,Do you think robots like Dora will become a household necessity?,I’m not sure they will become a necessity (unless we all become unable to care for ourselves!), but they will certainly become a luxury item in the future. It will be possible to order them from an online electronics store one day and have them arrive and start work the next. The big problem will then be training your robot to understand the layout of your home and the routines of your household. This is where we hope our work on exploration and curiosity will make people’s lives easier, as the robot will be motivated to learn things for itself, rather than wait to be taught everything.,Are the costs of transporting robots too prohibitive to send one to Mars?
Submitted by Steve,The answer has to be no, as NASA has already sent
two robots to Mars
: Spirit and Opportunity. This has cost in excess of $900 million! One interesting question is not the cost of transport, but the difficulties of controlling robots once they get to Mars. The delay of a radio signal between Earth and Mars can be over half an hour, so this precludes any direct control by a human (just imagine playing a game where every command you send takes 30 minutes to have any effect!). Therefore these robots must be equipped with forms of Artificial Intelligence to allow them to safely make decisions for themselves with only limited human intervention.,Does the software that is tasked with being curious continuously increase its capacity to explore / make connections
–
is it getting more creative?
Submitted by Charlie and Jake,I would say that it doesn’t really increase its capacity to explore (except beyond software that isn’t curious at all), but it does have a limitless appetite for exploration. Unless you artificially restrict its mobility, Dora will just keep trying to explore until its batteries run out or it gets stuck somewhere. A few years ago we were demonstrating Dora in a corridor that led to some toilets. Someone had left the door to the women’s toilets open, and before we knew it Dora had wandered off in there. Unfortunately, as our research team was all male at the time, we had to wait for someone female to come along to retrieve Dora!,Our view of robots is shaped by books and film
–
do you think this is helpful or misleading?,I think it’s mostly a good thing, as fiction (books, films and increasingly video games) motivate and inspire a large number of people to work in science and engineering to produce exciting and useful technologies such as robots. The main downside is that the reality of robotics research is a long way away from the images portrayed in fiction, so we risk disappointing people when we are unable to provide them with the robots that they imagine are possible. However, as you’ll see at Robotville, the robots that exist now are all really exciting in their own ways, and will only improve as more time and effort is dedicated to them.,Apple’s recent iphone update includes what some are claiming to be the first consumer robot. How relevant is this and do you think this idea of robots in our pockets will have a wider impact on robotic research and developments?,Whilst there have been consumer robots before Siri (including vacuum cleaners, lawn mowers and toys), the importance of Siri is that it demonstrates that it is possible to produce software that consumers can interact with about a range of tasks in a natural fashion (even if the results are not always perfect). Perhaps the biggest impact of the development of computers in our pockets will be the expectation that all our devices should share information to make our lives easier. For example my phone should know when I’m nearly home so that it can tell a future version of Dora to put the kettle on.,What are the ongoing cultural implications of your latest research?,Robots will change the way we live and work. The change will start from limited, well-defined tasks (such as robots that clean the floor and cars that park themselves) but will gradually become more noticeable across the whole of society. Some of the larger cultural questions we will ultimately need to face include whether we are happy to let robots care for our sick and elderly, and who is responsible when a robot that can learn and make decisions for itself causes some kind of problem."

Eric
. As the UK’s first robot, Eric holds a unique place in our history. Built in the late 1920s, he was everything we now imagine a robot to be – a talking, moving mechanical person.,Then Eric disappeared and no one knows what happened to him. My dream is to rebuild Eric and you can take part by joining our
Kickstarter campaign
before 17 June 2016.,,I discovered Eric’s remarkable story while researching the Science Museum’s next major exhibition,
Robots
, which opens in February 2017. Eric was the fruit of a remarkable collaboration which began in 1928, between Captain WH Richards and Alan Reffell.,Richards brought an entrepreneurial spirit and connections from a career in the media to the partnership, while Reffell supplied expert technical know-how. Together, they created a robot which wowed audiences across Britain and the USA.,Eric’s debut came in September 1928 at London’s Royal Horticultural Halls – the Duke of York, originally booked to open an exhibition of model engineering had pulled out. Captain Richards remarked, ‘it is a mechanical show, let us have a mechanical man to open it’ and work began on building Eric. He won over his debut audience with what enraptured journalists described as ‘a really sparkling speech’.,Looking back now, you could say Eric was relatively simple. He could stand up, take a bow and move his arms. He was, in a way, everything that we imagined a robot would be. Even now when you ask kids to draw a robot, they draw something that looks like Eric.,Eric’s success was widely reported in the USA, Britain and Europe. He began a series of tours around North America and Britain. An improved version of Eric, called George, was later built but no-one knows what happened to Eric.,Many historic robots were cannibalised for parts, accidentally broken up, or mislaid. For all their robust steel and aluminium construction and sheer size, robots have often proved to be rather ephemeral, and their individual stories have sometimes taken them from riches to rags, before rediscovery and restoration.,Rebuilding Eric’s anatomy needs both curatorial and engineering research, and we’re excited to be working with Giles Walker, a London-based kinetic artist with 20 years of robot-building experience, who will build Eric in his workshop. Even though technology has dramatically changed since Eric was first created in 1928, rebuilding Eric isn’t going to be straightforward as there are no blueprints to work from.,A small number of photos of Eric do survive along with an illustrated article from the 1928
Illustrated London News
, but the original creators kept much of Eric’s inner workings a secret. However from those images and some archive film footage we know what Eric was capable of doing and have reverse engineered how he was built (with a certain amount of informed guess work).,The chance to rebuild Eric, who was not just a research tool but a piece of spectacular showmanship and one of the earliest robots ever built, is an opportunity too great to miss.,If you would like to be part of Eric’s remarkable story visit

Anna Fisher describes what happened next. ,"Education,Families","building bridges,explainers","On the evening of Wednesday 13 July, the Science Museum opened its doors to the friends and family of those taking part in our
Building Bridges
project.,For the project, we have been working with year 7 students, aged 11-12, in London and Reading, with the aim of igniting students’ curiosity in science and helping them explore the science that shapes their lives; in the classroom, at home and in their communities.,The Science Museum team spent the morning of the event cutting, sticking, printing and putting together the final touches to
Twilight at the Science Museum
. The after-hours event was similar to
Lates
events we run for adults, but this time young people could enjoy all of the extra things we had planned.,At 6.45pm, families streamed into the Museum dancing to the sounds from the live DJ, excited by the buzz and eager to get stuck in to activities such as tasting liquid nitrogen ice cream, building the tallest straw tower, exploring unusual materials with our Explainers, and screen printing their own tote bags with help from
Screen Grab
.,The Building Bridges project works with teachers, schools and their students throughout the year, developing and testing activities that help students make links between the science they learn and the world they live in. The Twilight event was a way to thank them for all their hard work.,We even invited some special guests along to make the night more memorable;
Science Dome
pop-up planetarium, live drawing from
illustrators
, and
research scientists
from Imperial College London who enthralled visitors with tales of building body parts through tissue engineering and gave families the chance to have a go at being a biological engineer.,Families also experienced all the wonderful objects and fun activities you would expect from the Science Museum, from creative family workshops to science demonstrations and costumed characters sparking conversations about science.,Next September the Building Bridges project will be entering its final year. With the help of researchers from University College London the project is finding new ways to engage families in exploring science, by working closely with schools and teachers to create learning resources that encourage more students to see the value of Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths.,We look forward to meeting next year’s participants and continuing our search for new ways to ignite curiosity in science!,If you are looking for exciting activities for your family in the Museum head to our
events calendar
to see what’s on. The Learning team run fun free
science shows
in the Museum every day of the week, with extra workshops, storytelling, drama characters and family-friendly tours at weekends and during school holidays.,Anna Fisher is the Learning Resources Project Coordinator for

Given the strong views some people have about this booking, I wanted to provide some context about the museum’s commercial activities.,As Director, I have a responsibility to balance financial sustainability, during a period when Government funding has been reduced, with achieving our goal to be the leading international museum championing the understanding, enjoyment and prestige of science.,Our response to this fiscal challenge has involved a combination of reducing our running costs and increasing the income we generate. Alongside philanthropic support from individuals and companies we continue to expand the range and scope of our commercial activities, including offering spaces for hire for corporate events outside the hours when the museum is open to the public.,Among the many corporate events taking place at the museum this year is the welcome reception for Farnborough International Airshow. The show is a key event for the UK aerospace industry, a subject area in which the Science Museum holds major collections and an industry which is a prominent investor in science and engineering. We treated this event as we would a booking from any other legitimate organisation.,The revenue generated by bookings such as this plays an important role in the funding mix that enables us to remain free to millions of visitors, run the biggest educational programme of its kind, and allows us to curate world-class exhibitions.,I respect people’s right to hold different views but I believe we are making the right decisions to secure the long-term future of the museum for the public good."

Here she explains their process of data visualisation and projection mapping for
Dress For Our Time
by London College of Fashion’s Professor Helen Storey MBE RDI.,Over the past twelve months, four of Holition’s team have worked tirelessly on
Dress For Our Time
: Tommy Howard (Head Creative), Noah Henderson (2D Artist), Miguel Ceballos (Creative Technologist) and Matt Nelson (Project Manager). Miguel was in charge of coding and programming the UN refugee data and worked closely with the rest of the team to conceptualise and shape the data visualisation based upon the geographical movement of the refugees, whilst Noah oversaw projection mapping of the data.,Both these tasks were hugely challenging – the team were using numbers to tell human stories and needed to create a map that nobody had seen before, that was both an abstract artistic piece and something that was logical enough for visitors to understand, all the while ensuring it was accurate and meaningful.,The data that
Dress For Our Time
is using was released in June this year by the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR)
Global Trends Report on Forced Displacement
. The UNHCR currently recognises 16.1 million people as refugees worldwide. This project focuses on a portion of the globe which is currently home to 8.02 million refugees (49.8% of the global refugee population): Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.,The team settled on the idea of using a map as the underlying reference point for the visualisation as it is easily identifiable and effective at putting the scale and geographical spread of this crisis into context for the viewer.,A key visual concept for the piece is that one pixel represents the lives of one hundred refugees, meaning that there are 80,000 pixels of light in play on the Dress. The lights flow up from six points at the hem of the dress, which represent the continents the refugees have left, before populating the countries in which they find shelter.,At Holition we believe that art and science can and should co-create in order to provide new perspectives and this project really is a perfect example of this notion – Tommy Howard called it a
“perfect canvas to express a global problem through the innovative alchemy of creative data visualisation and Helen’s skills as an artist and designer”
.,Similarly, Jonathan Chippindale explained to me that the
Dress For Our Time
collaboration has very much been about humanising the data in the hope that the visitor empathises with it – “
we wanted to focus on the individual, to encourage viewers to begin to see the scale of the refugee crisis not just at a geographical level, but also at a more human level. Hopefully, viewers will start to realise that, faced with the same set of circumstances, they too might have been forced to make the same decisions, and that in reality we are both no different”.,Dress For Our Time
opened at the Science Museum on 17 August and will close on 4 September 2016. This project runs alongside
Our Lives in Data
, an exhibition investigating human stories behind data science and how big data is being used to rapidly transform the world around us."

Curator David Rooney explores the story of this eloquent, striking and powerful embodiment of the mathematics of risk.","Collections and Objects,Exhibitions and Galleries","maths,maths gallery,transport","We have not always wanted to fly.,In an age of cheap mass flight, it can be hard to recall the earliest days of civil aviation. We tend to assume the demand for flying has always been there, suppressed only by the limitations of the science and technology of the day. In reality, a market for civil aviation had to be constructed, and it was not an easy sell.,The first daily scheduled airline service flew in August 1919. By today’s standards it was a modest affair. The aircraft seated a grand total of two alongside packets of mail and ran between Hounslow Heath (near today’s London Heathrow Airport) and Le Bourget, just outside Paris. It used converted military bomber aircraft with a glazed cabin for the passengers.,Passengers were reluctant to come forward. Flights were cramped, noisy and slow. But underlying concerns about comfort was a much more profound problem that faces all new public technologies, – trust.,In wartime, aviation safety came second to military effectiveness. Flying was risky, but the risk was tolerated (to an extent) because wars needed to be won. Speed and manoeuvrability were more vital than safety, stability and ease of handling. But in peacetime, among passengers affluent enough to journey overseas, air travel was only an option if aircraft could be trusted to bring everyone back to earth safely. And throughout the 1920s, many did not.,Risk is a mathematical concept. It describes the probability of something bad happening, and it forms the basis of today’s multi-billion-pound insurance industry as well as occupying the minds of countless scientists, technologists, engineers and politicians, as well as you and me. We go through life assessing risk, whether we know it or not. We carry out mathematical practices day in, day out.,Mathematics: The Winton Gallery
is a bold new permanent exhibition opening at the Science Museum on 8 December. Hanging at the centre of this gallery will be the Handley Page ‘Gugnunc’, an experimental aeroplane built in 1929. An eloquent, striking and powerful embodiment of the mathematics of risk, this aeroplane was constructed to compete in the ‘Safe Aircraft Competition’ for $150,000 in prize money mounted by US philanthropist and industrialist Daniel Guggenheim.,At the heart of the Gugnunc was a system of wing flaps and slots that prevented the aircraft from stalling at slow speeds and steep angles – the conditions of take-off and landing which were the riskiest moments of any flight. One commentator described the Handley Page slot as ‘the greatest advance in airplane design since the Wright brothers flew’.,The Handley Page ‘Gugnunc’ is just one of over 100 remarkable objects in
the gallery
that will tell a new history of mathematical practice and how it has shaped our world over the last 400 years.,These stories are about life and death, war and peace, trade and travel – and the money that makes everything happen. They are, therefore, stories about people as much as theorems and abstract concepts. They show the power of mathematics to create opportunities, to build markets, to get new ideas off the ground. They show that the work of mathematicians is all around us, not least in the worldwide holiday and business flights that we all now take for granted.,Mathematics: The Winton Gallery

We want to share the latest mind-blowing scientific discoveries and innovations with everyone who comes through our doors, but keeping things up-to-date isn’t always easy.,Science moves fast but museums, by their nature, adopt a slower pace. Much of what we do best is to present world-changing ideas and inventions, often from a distant past when scientific instruments were beautifully crafted in mahogany and brass.,When it comes to contemporary science, museums such as ours have to make an educated guess on the most significant stories to tell and objects to put on show. How can exhibits be kept up to date for many years as scientific knowledge advances and public attitudes change?,,,,In the past week many of these questions and challenges have been playing on my mind, following a lively discussion on social media about an exhibit on the science of sex and gender in our
Who Am I?
gallery
, which explores the wealth of scientific ideas that inform our understanding of human identity.,I worked on
Who Am I?
when it was last refreshed back in 2010 and the aim at the time was to present the cutting-edge scientific knowledge of the day on what makes us
us,
me
me
and you
you
. I headed up a team of researchers (we call them Content Developers) who spent many months scouring scientific journals and interviewing countless inspiring researchers from around the world. We also worked with a vast network of eminent geneticists, neuroscientists, psychologists and other experts to create the gallery.,Scientific accuracy is vital to the Museum – our reputation depends on it – and we put in place rigorous processes to ensure we get things right, from expert advisory boards who look at the broad messages in an exhibition, to subject specialists who are invited to scrutinise every word we write.,It is now six years since
Who am I?
was updated – and much of the research featured in the gallery is a decade older. The exhibit in the gallery that has recently received attention on Twitter is titled
Boy or Girl?
It features stories, objects and research including studies into sexual preference and behaviour, tests to see the sex of an unborn baby, and a section looking at gender identity and the evidence for biological differences between the sexes.,The thinking behind
Who am I?
– and the sex and gender display in particular – was to communicate the latest research clearly and accurately, but we also believe that featuring contributions from other viewpoints and disciplines is essential when examining a question as complex and profoundly personal as ‘who am I?’.,With this in mind, we chose to include work from numerous artists (including, most famously, Antony Gormley’s
Iron Baby
) and stories from a range of people who are personally involved in the issues covered. In the sections of
Who am I?
that examine gender and sex, for instance, we collaborated with a transgender person – ‘Alex’ – whose experiences feature in one of the gallery exhibits.,Some of the comments we have received question the accuracy of the science in the exhibition – and the words and images we chose to explain it. Words such as ‘hardwired’, for instance, which feature on several labels, are today especially and understandably controversial when used in combination with ideas like gender.,,,,Other concerns have been raised about an interactive game in the gallery that explores the male and female brain. Specifically,
the game
presents studies scientists have carried out to investigate if there are small differences on average in the way that men and women complete certain tasks, largely based around the recognition of abstract shapes and patterns.
This game
– which dates back 16 years to the gallery’s inception – was designed to be tongue in cheek and provocative (think silly voices akin to a Pathé news reel) and visitors are invited to take some of the real tests that scientists used, scoring male or female ‘brain points’ on a ‘sex-o-meter’ that is coloured pink and blue.,As a Museum we always attempt to present ideas in different ways – labels and objects but also games, animations and ‘interactives’ – and in this case the artistic licence taken in the year 2000 to create a provocative exhibit appears outdated. Certainly from preliminary work looking at the latest scientific evidence, the ideas presented are now in question.,Social attitudes also change. We have received responses from visitors who are concerned about how we feature transgender issues, which are now very much more in the public consciousness than they were back in 2010, let alone the year 2000.,The idea of
Who am I?
was always to raise questions. We present issues in ways that provoke debate, however we would never want to compromise the accuracy of the content on display.,Of course we would like to keep all of our galleries and exhibitions up-to-date, but with many thousands of objects on show and finite resources and time this is not always possible.,However, with an issue of such scientific and cultural importance as this we have decided it is essential that we look again at the exhibit. We are now talking to leading experts in neuroscience and clinical psychology to consider whether the latest scientific evidence warrants making changes to our exhibit.,Science moves fast, and while it isn’t always possible for us to keep up, on some issues it is essential that we quicken our pace to make sure we haven’t been left behind.,Watch this space for further details.,Update: Following a review of current scientific research and discussions with several neuroscientists, the interactive game has now been removed from the Who Am I? gallery."

TEDxLondon
event on ‘the end of ageing’.,Guest-curated by high-altitude physician and entrepreneur Dr Jack Kriendler, speakers tackled issues of life, death and ageing from a myriad of perspectives: biology, moral philosophy, science fiction, art and digital technology.,The discussion challenged us to wonder: if we can engineer the end of ageing, what does a good life look like?,As one speaker, economist, philosopher and philanthropist Dr Shamil Chandaria argued, the development of super-longevity must be considered within a framework of human well-being, meaning and purpose.,Today, the numerical measure – the ‘QUALY’ or ‘quality-adjusted life-year’ –aims to quantify the relationship between health and quality of life, and to determine the ‘value’ of medical interventions.,Reducing life and death to numbers is nothing new.,This is strikingly evident on the pages of a book which will be displayed in
Mathematics: The Winton Gallery
at the Science Museum from 8 December 2016. The book is the
English Life Table
published in 1864. This three-inch thick publication was full of tables and equations based on an analysis of nearly 6.5 million deaths over 17 years.,It was the work of William Farr, the General Register Office’s first statistician, who dedicated his career to the study of life expectancy.,But in an era before digital computers, how did Farr crunch the numbers? In the Victorian period, mammoth calculation tasks were usually performed by hand, by human beings. And this meant human error and vast amounts of time.,Farr’s answer lay in a machine: a ‘difference engine’. Invented by Charles Babbage, and brought to the market by the Swedish father-and-son Georg and Edvard Scheutz, the difference engine could calculate simple arithmetical sums and print out the results, therefore avoiding transcription mistakes. It created tables of otherwise impossible precision and reliability.,The
English Life Table
was a work of enormous mathematical and social significance. It allowed people to better understand their insurance premiums and built public trust in the insurance industry.,Next time you’re lured by an online life expectancy calculator or make a decision about your health insurance, life assurance or retirement, it’s worth considering that this is all based on a complex understanding of the mathematics of mortality.,The story of mathematics and mortality features in
Mathematics: The Winton Gallery,
which opens to the public on the 8 December 2016. The gallery brings together stories of mathematicians, their tools and ideas from the late 16th century to the present day.

‘Robots’
Lead Curator Ben Russell introduces its replacement within the exhibition, the ‘Draughtsman-Writer’.,The Science Museum is delighted to have borrowed, from the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, USA, one of the most amazing automatons ever built.,The ‘Draughtsman-Writer’ automaton was built by Henri Maillardet in about 1800. It is one of the most remarkable examples from a whole generation of machines designed to imitate life. Some could play musical instruments like the flute, others moved with tremendous subtlety, appearing to gently breathe, show emotion, or even turn to acknowledge their audience as they performed.,The ‘Draughtsman-Writer’ could write: using a specially-designed pen, it could commit to paper four drawings and three poems, in English and French. The details of each were physically programmed into a huge array of ‘cams’, each intricately formed to a particular shape. The automaton’s mechanism converted the cams’ motions into the movements of the childlike writer above, who would commit them to paper. The automaton had the biggest mechanical memory of any machine made at this time.,The automaton arrived at the Franklin Institute in a very poor condition in November 1928, and much of the story of where it had been was unclear. It had travelled in England and across Europe, but then disappeared before being rediscovered in the USA. It was carefully and intricately conserved, and returned to working order.,At first, it was not clear who had built the Automaton. However, when it was first set to work again at the Franklin Institute, at the conclusion of the final poem it wrote ‘Ecrit par L’Automate de Maillardet’ – ‘Written by the Automaton of Maillardet’. Amazingly, the secret of its maker had been preserved inside the automaton’s mechanical mind.,The Draughtsman-Writer will be displayed in the Science museum’s ‘

Christmas cheer
planned here at the Science Museum
, but
we also always look forward to what our friends at the Royal Institution have in store for their annual
Christmas Lectures
.
This year we’re excited to hear materials chemist Professor Saiful Islam talk about energy and new fuel technologies.,This is just one example of many ways in which chemistry plays an important role in addressing the challenges we face – but all too often it is a somewhat forgotten subject.
Research by the Royal Society of Chemistry
shows that many people aren’t aware of the huge variety of what chemists, chemical engineers and others working in the field do.,That’s why we are very pleased to be collaborating with the Royal Society of Chemistry to raise awareness and understanding of the role and value of chemistry and the chemical sciences in society. Our world-class chemistry collections – encompassing around 10,000 objects spanning experimental chemistry, industrial chemistry, plastics, and biochemistry – are a hugely rich resource to illustrate the range of roles played by chemistry and chemists today and in the past.,They include objects associated with famous names, such as a chemical chest owned by Michael Faraday (who made the RI Christmas Lectures famous), items associated with William Henry Perkin and mauve, apparatus used by William Ramsay in research on the noble gases, and the archive of James Lovelock. But they also include many more objects used by little-known people working in laboratories, industry and government, and while these objects are not famous they have many stories to tell.,Taking on the challenging – but enviable – task of bringing these collections to life, Sophie Waring will join us in February as our new Curator of Chemistry.  She says “I am completely delighted to be joining the curatorial team at the Science Museum and to have the privilege of curating the Museum’s world class chemistry collection. Working closely with the Royal Society of Chemistry I’m looking forward to using the collection to tell chemistry stories that will inspire the chemists, material scientists and innovators of tomorrow.”,Sophie joins us from the Museum of the History of Science, University of Oxford, where she has recently co-curated
Back from the Dead, Demystifying Antibiotics
.
Celebrating the seventy-fifth anniversary of the first human trials of penicillin at Oxford, the exhibition brings together the history of wartime work on developing penicillin into a viable pharmaceutical with current research on antimicrobial resistance at the University of Oxford. The exhibition features several objects on loan from the Science Museum, including one of the stars of our collection – Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin’s molecular model of penicillin.,Sophie says “Coming to the Science Museum I hope to be able to work with the collection to focus on the materials that chemists make and manipulate as well as their research work. Showing visitors that science is everywhere in their lives, not just with powerful devices but, even more importantly, with reliable and exciting substances of the everyday, is an exciting challenge.” We’re looking forward to 2017!"

Science Museum Group
, represented by Director Ian Blatchford, along with the
Royal Society
,
Wellcome Trust
and
Open University
.,For those who remember the original Tomorrow’s World, a flagship BBC TV series that ran for nearly 40 years, this news may bring back nostalgic memories of presenters like Raymond Baxter, Maggie Philbin or Carmen Pryce showcasing revolutionary inventions that were hoped to change our world. It was described as television trying to predict the future of science, and it did a pretty good job of doing so.,More than fifty years on from the first broadcast and the world has changed, not least because of the rise of the internet. And what we want science communication to accomplish has changed too. We no longer want to just reveal new science to those who are already engaged and watching, we want to inspire and empower everyone – whoever and wherever they are. By questioning our lives and searching for answers, we are all researchers.,That’s why for the past year, myself and other representatives from the partners involved have worked together on this shared ambition, and using the Tomorrow’s World identity, we now seek to launch Britain’s biggest engagement project this June.,Across digital, broadcast and our partners’ channels, we aim to capture the attention of new audiences, inspire curiosity and ignite national conversations. This is just the start though; we hope to see more people and institutions join over time to ensure it continues well into the future.,,This morning’s event opened with BBC Director-General Tony Hall revealing these shared ambitions and our quest to
“…make the UK the very best place in the world to do science and to equip all of us with the knowledge and understanding we need to make sense of our lives”
.  For the campaign that will support the Tomorrow’s World vision, he announced at least 40 hours of TV (including
Britain’s Greatest Inventions
that sees the Science Museum’s Wroughton site play a starring role), a series of hyper-contemporary podcasts, live events, and at the centre of it all, a digital hub:,“For the first time ever, Britain will have a digital space where the best of UK science can work together and showcase its work together.… committing to make science more relevant, more accessible and more personal to each of us.”,Tony Hall, BBC Director-General,Brian Cox, The Royal Society Professor for Public Engagement in Science, then followed, focusing on the importance and necessity of the Tomorrow’s World campaign for today’s society. Quoting Jacob Bronowski , who did the landmark BBC series The Ascent of Man in 1973, and asking
“who should fight for Britain to be the best place to do science”,
Cox suggested that this responsibility falls to all science establishments and education centres, and to the BBC
“as the bridge to all citizens”
.,UCL mathematician and BBC science communicator Hannah Fry described how her journey into maths was first inspired by trips to the Science Museum (“my spiritual home”), aged 11, and how her love for it lives on because “it helps you see the world in a very new light”. Adding to this empowering illustration of science knowledge, Fry eluded to the need for us to “open up the conversation”, before finishing with her involvement in the BBC2 live broadcast of Britain’s Greatest Inventions.,And finally, before the 100 plus press and key opinion formers in attendance entered our
Robots
exhibition to learn more, our very own director Ian Blatchford took to the stage to share highlights from our own plans, which beyond digital and broadcast includes a space-themed Tomorrow’s World Lates in August, and our intention to rename our ‘

.,“
The Tomorrow’s World partnership is already bearing fruit with Britain’s Greatest Inventions, a 90-minute live broadcast from our stores that will air on BBC Two….And renaming our contemporary science gallery ‘Tomorrow’s World’ shows our true commitment to this partnership.”,Ian Blatchford, Director of the Science Museum,What is

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/london-2050/,Jon Farrow,London 2050,"Looking ahead is important, so this month we’re asking ourselves: what will the world be like in 2050?",At the Museum,"Contemporary science,lates",",The world around us is moving and changing more rapidly now than ever before. With all the hustle and bustle, sometimes it’s difficult to stop, take a moment and look up to see where we’re heading. Looking ahead is important, so this month we’re asking ourselves:
what will the world be like in 2050
?,Predicting the future is always a messy business. Who would have thought in the 1980s that by 2016 we’d be able to fit our entire music collections in our pockets, print 3D objects at home, or that cars would be able to drive themselves? That said, we’re still waiting for Moon bases, flying cars and properly hovering skateboards.,No matter what the future brings, one thing is pretty certain: we’ll still need to eat. That doesn’t mean that what we eat, how we prepare it or how we produce it will stay the same. Far from it! Nearly everything in our food system will change, and I for one welcome the future of food.,The world’s population is expected to reach
9.7 billion
by 2050, meaning farms will need to provide more food, but will have less space to grow it. At the moment, farmers generally treat whole fields as if they were one organism. But plants vary slightly in their needs because of the soil, weather and random variation. Imagine if farmers could give exactly the food and water needed to each individual plant. This is called precision farming, and it will become more important in the coming decades.,Even now there are prototypes that demonstrate how fields might be planted by swarms of autonomous robots. We’re bringing one of these robots into the
Antenna
gallery, where you can see it from 8 April.
Prospero
is a bio-inspired robotic crab that shows what the future of farming might look like.,While diets will almost certainly contain less meat in 2050, that doesn’t mean all our food will come from fields. One of the things I’m most excited to see during our
London 2050
Lates
evening on 30 March and themed weekend on 2-3 April is the
Ministry of Nutrition
. This futuristic government agency has travelled through time from 2050 with some tasty delicacies to show us what we might be eating (I’ve heard rumours of jellyfish and crickets).,The Lates event will be full of all sorts of exciting food activities, from a talk about
The Future of Food
by
Jozef Youssef
, to a
Market of the (Near) Future
where you can check out products available now that are ahead of their time. We’ve even put ourselves in a future mind-set to reinterpret the ground floor of the Museum from the perspective of a curator in 2050. The result is our
London 2050 Trail
, which will be active on the night of Lates as well as the following weekend.,Taking a moment to reflect on the future has been really interesting (and a lot of fun!), so we hope that you’ll come and join us in

Scale
, in the Wonderlab Show Space, 19.30-20.00, during
Lates
on 31 May.,Traditionally physics has sought the fundamental laws that govern a force, or a particle or a field, those laws that work at the subatomic level or the farthest reaches of the cosmos. But Geoffrey West, distinguished professor and past president of the Santa Fe Institute, New Mexico, and senior fellow at Los Alamos National Laboratory, is trying to find the laws at work in the real world, laws which govern the messy complexities of life.,Over the past few decades West has compared the ways in which cities, companies, and organisms work and believes that each represents a riff on a universal theme, manifesting a surprising simplicity beneath their extraordinary complexity and diversity.,An elephant is a scaled-up pygmy shrew, and London a scaled-up Taunton, where West was born, according to his book Scale: The Universal Laws of Pretty Much Everything.,West has put together a grand synthesis of scaling (that is, how the various characteristics of a system change when you change its size) that provides surprising insights into why there are no mammals the size of ants, whether cities are glorified organisms and a framework for global sustainability.,In his interdisciplinary search for the mathematical patterns underlying life, cities and commerce, West has garnered many awards in the fields of ecology, aging and mathematical biology, along with the accolade of being Time magazine’s “One of the 100 Most Influential People in the World.”,The efforts to uncover the mathematical fabric of life began in earnest with the work of biologist D’Arcy Wentworth Thompson, who a century ago published what West calls a ‘wonderful book’,
On Growth and Form
.,Although West started out working on theories on quarks, gluons and string theory, he turned his lens two decades ago to the study of scaling laws in biology: it turns out that as animal size increases, almost all physiological functions, like heart rate, also scale in a systematic way from the intracellular level up to ecosystems over almost 30 orders of magnitude.,All creatures, from pygmy shrews to whales, have equal lifespans when accounted in number of heartbeats: about 1.5 billion of them. West wanted to understand why this regularity holds true, even though organisms are so bewilderingly diverse, with varying adaptations, evolutionary histories, lifespans and survival strategies.,He found that life is ruled by scaling relationships. These are not linear, when doubling one quantity doubles another, but non-linear – they tend to obey what are called power laws: a parameter will increase in proportion to size raised to some exponent, in the case of metabolism, three quarters.,I first encountered Geoffrey West in 1997, when he and colleagues derived this factor of 3/4 from first principles, drawing on ideas about fractals in networks – self similar structures, from cauliflowers to clouds and, in this case blood vessel networks, consisting of branching structures, from the level of arteries down to capillaries.,They assumed this network of vessels must feed every cell of the organism. Secondly, that they had the same basic units of cells, capillaries and so on whether mouse or whale. Third, that evolution has optimised them to get oxygen most efficiently to tissues and organs.,The number four in this factor of ¾ turned out to be important because it represents the dimensionality of the space we live in plus one, to do with the fractal nature of these networks. This held the key to understanding the metabolic limitations of animals.,He has applied this thinking in all kinds of circumstances, from the growth of ecosystem to cancer to the hours of sleep, to show why a mouse sleeps 15 hours and a whale just two.,Even cities can be viewed this way. West does not regard them as mechanical entities but more like living organisms, constantly adapting and evolving.,Within them, he suggests two interacting networks are at work: people and infrastructure so, for example, a map of lorry journeys looks a bit like a network of blood vessels.,With this understanding, it turns out that if you know the population of a city you can reasonably accurately predict that features that are networked, so you can work out, as you increase city size, how many petrol stations there are, what is the total length of roads, electrical cables and so on.,Once again, there are important economies of scale: a city that is twice as populous as another does not have double the infrastructure and productivity.,The good news is it is more efficient, with less infrastructure than you would expect, along with more productivity per head.,If you double the size of a city from 50,000 to a hundred thousand, a million to two million, five million to ten million, you get a roughly 15 percent boost in productivity, patents, the number of research institutions, wages and so on, and you get systematically a 15 percent saving in length of roads and other infrastructure.,The bad news, however, is that cities suffer from more crime.,Overall, he says, ‘diseases spread faster, businesses are born and die more often, commerce is transacted more rapidly, and people even walk faster’.,This understanding of how city growth affects society and the environment is fundamental if we are to make modern life sustainable, he argues, because the fate of cities is ‘the fate of the planet.’,Geoffrey West, will be discussing his book in the Wonderlab Show Space between 19.30-20.00, during

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/researching-faces-data-gathered-science-museum-help-autistic-children/,Allan Ponniah,Researching faces: how data gathered at the Science Museum could help autistic children,,"At the Museum,Research,Science in the news",,"Dr.Allan Ponniah is a Consultant Plastic Surgeon at the Royal Free Hospital, London. He has been involved in the latest Live Science experiment at the Science Museum –
‘Are your facial expressions unique?’
– run in collaboration with researchers from Imperial College London. Below he explores how the data gathered at Live Science could improve the lives of autistic children and people undergoing reconstructive surgery amongst many others.,The human face is an incredible part of our bodies. It plays heavily into how we view ourselves and how the world sees us especially in terms of our identity, perceived beauty, ability to communicate and the expression of emotions.,Surprisingly up until now, analysis of the face has been very limited. I first encountered this during my plastic and reconstructive surgery training as many of the ideals of facial proportions were based on north American Caucasian females. This was due to a lot of previous work being driven by the cosmetic surgery market and as a result planning surgery for facial disfigurement could be difficult if the patient fell within a demographic that had not previously been studied.,,,It was for this reason that whilst I was conducting research at Great Ormond Street Hospital, I set up the largest 3D facial data collection at the Science Museum in 2012. As visitors to the museum come from diverse backgrounds, we were able to collect data for a wide range of age, ethnic and gender groups. To analyse such a data-set I set up a collaboration with Stefanos Zafeiriou from Imperial College London (ICL) and the research gathered then led to the creation of the most accurate digital model of the human face in existence.,Stefanos and I now have a new project at the Science Museum, where we are developing our original research further by collecting 3D data of facial expressions. Once visitors have filled out information covering their ethnic background they are invited to make facial expressions based on emotions like fear, anger, happiness etc. While they’re doing this our 3dMD cameras capture their expressions allowing us to build up a full digital map of how their faces move and express emotion.,The result will be a range of 3D renderings representing about 30 “typical” people of different genders, ethnicities and age groups to help with planning facial reconstruction surgery. The project has excited the public and press with The Times praising the way – ‘moving footage of volunteers pulling a wide range of expressions, including happy, sad, surprised and disgusted, will enable more realistic remodelling…and help people who need reconstructive surgery.’ This 3D technology can also be applied in non-medical ways, such as in games where the desire for accuracy in characters portrayals is ever more important, virtual reality and other entertainment industries.,,One exciting application of this technology is as a tool to help children with autism. Stefanos has previously worked with Maja Pantic  – a Professor at ICL who developed the technology behind the Kaspar robot which is used to help children with autism. We are also consulting various experts and charities including the team at Great Ormond Street Hospital, the National Autistic Society and the Makaton charity in the development of an app that could help children across the autistic spectrum.,A common characteristic of autism is it can make judging the meaning behind other people’s facial expressions more difficult. As a significant amount of human interaction is non-verbal being able to understand common facial expressions can open up a world of new ways to communicate. Hopefully this could help autistic children to feel more confident in their interactions with others, and could inspire the discovery of many more ways of helping people by using the research conducted at the Science Museum.,Live Science ‘Are your facial expressions unique?’
is running in the ‘Who Am I’ gallery until 3rd of July 2017."
https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/does-maths-work-for-you/,Chris Hayhurst,Does maths work for you?,,At the Museum,,"Chris Hayhurst is the European Consulting Manager for
MathWorks
– a developer of mathematical computing software for engineers and scientists. MathWorks is a sponsor of new gallery
Mathematics:The Winton Gallery
at the Science Museum. Below Chris explores how maths has built the world around us.,What image does maths bring to your mind? For many it might be squared paper and a pencil, a graph, incomprehensible symbols, perhaps beauty or maybe fear. Does it actually help you in your work, your everyday life? In short, does maths work for you? Perhaps if we could get beyond the squared paper, sums and calculators, we could see maths in a new way.,Maths is in fact all around us, ensuring our savings are well invested, the supermarket shelves are stocked with the food we want to eat, our weather forecasts are accurate and that the cars that we drive are safe. In all of these situations, computers have replaced hand calculations and made our everyday lives easier.,The Science Museum’s
Mathematics: The Winton Gallery
beautifully shows, step by step, how maths has shaped our world.,,My favourite object in the gallery is Thomson’s tide predicting machine. In 1876 it was known that tides are influenced by many different factors, combining to produce a complicated pattern. Accurate predictions were very important for shipping but were hard to calculate by hand. Thomson created this mechanism to do this specific task easily. Turning the wheel combined the effects of 10 different tidal influences to generate weeks of predictions for any port or harbour.,,Within 60 years, more general purpose machines were being created. This unit from the Hartree differential analyser that occupies a large part of the gallery was built in 1935 and is really a mechanical analogue computer. Originally built to solve problems with electricity distribution grids it could also be re-purposed to apply maths to a whole range of real life problems.,Soon, electronics replaced mechanics, allowing calculations to be carried out much faster. In 1984,
MathWorks
was founded as a company to allow people to do maths using these computers. The company name meant just what it says – the math works. The software that came from that, MATLAB, made complicated and long winded hand calculations fast. Just as importantly, instead of taking days to re-purpose or program the calculations for the differential analyser above, MATLAB made it easy to apply maths to new problems.,,Safe in the knowledge that the maths works, MATLAB has allowed millions of students, engineers and scientists to concentrate on their designs, cars, planes, chemistry, physics or data ever since. Version 1.3 of MATLAB is on display in
Mathematics: The Winton Gallery
.,Another 30 years on and computers are thousands of times more powerful. The rise of computing power has made it more not less important to have strong maths skills, and yet it doesn’t seem any easier to enthuse people about maths. This is why we at MathWorks were so excited when we heard of the Science Museum’s plan to create
Mathematics: The Winton Gallery
.  This new gallery isn’t a maths lesson but a powerful invitation to see how maths has already shaped our world. Our hope is that this will inspire people to investigate maths further now and go on to fuel engineering and science progress in the future.,,MathWorks is proud to sponsor this gallery, helping to give thousands of people every week a glimpse of the wonder of maths. Since partnering with the museum, we have enjoyed showing inspiring applications of maths at events in the Science Museum.,We have shown the asymmetry of encryption – just one line of maths in MATLAB can simulate how an Enigma machine encrypts messages. Cracking those messages was nearly impossible in World War II but was shown to be possible in seconds with today’s powerful parallel computing and statistics.,,We have also shown that images can be reduced to numbers and, through maths and machine learning, computers can learn how to recognise photos of objects in the museum without any knowledge of features that could distinguish for example a phone box from a steam engine.,,,The United Kingdom has a great heritage in engineering and many of our greatest feats are highlighted throughout the Science Museum.
Mathematics: The Winton Gallery
shows that maths lays the foundation for many of these developments.  To continue innovating we need more and more people who are confident, excited about maths, knowing that It can be made to work for them."

Wimbledon
this month (and lucky you if you have!) you will instead be watching on a colour television. This may not seem particularly momentous, but it actually has real historic significance. It was 47 years ago, in 1967 that the Wimbledon Tennis Championships became the first ever UK television programme to be broadcast in colour.,The Championships were broadcast on
BBC 2
, which initially became the only channel to broadcast in colour, showing just five hours of colour TV a week. This transition from black and white to colour was a huge step-forward in broadcasting technology; however it was only appreciated by a few as there were less than 5,000 colour TV sets in circulation at the time.,One of these was the Sony Trinitron TV, and
this one
(shown below) is part of the
Science Museum Group collection
.,The Sony Trinitron TV displayed colour by use of a ‘single-gun three-cathode picture tube’, capable of broadcasting separate red, green and blue signals (RGB) in succession. This technology was first developed by
John Logie Baird
, a Scottish engineer well-known as the inventor of the world’s first television. He demonstrated the first colour television publicly in 1928, but due to the war suspending the BBC television service, and ultimately ending his research, the development of this technology for broadcasting was delayed.,When the
Wimbledon Championships
did eventually become the first colour broadcast in 1967, the interest in colour TV quickly gained momentum. Viewers cited a greater feeling of realism when watching in colour and the broadcasts aim to exploit this interest by seeking more programmes that would benefit in colour, such as the snooker programme
Pot Black
, and children’s TV programme
Thunderbirds
. Shortly after Birds Eye Peas became the first colour advertisement. By mid-1968 nearly every BBC2 programme was in colour. BBC1 and ITV quickly followed and were also regularly broadcasting in colour by 1969.,However, broadcasters still made programmes in black and white for some time, due to the large expense of the TV sets, as well as the increased cost of a colour TV license (£10 in comparison to £5 for a black and white license) which made the demand for colour TV sets increase more slowly. By 1969 there were still only 100,000 in circulation but viewers soon caught up and by 1972 there were over 1.6 million in the UK.,The Wimbledon Championships are still acting as a landmark televised event today, as in 2011 it became the first TV programme to be
broadcast in 3D
. However, history repeated itself, as only a few viewers could appreciate the new technology due to the small number of 3D TV sets owned in the UK. So how long do you think it will be until we are all watching the Wimbledon Championships in 3D?,Volunteer Chloe Vince looks back at the first colour TV broadcast.

Dunkirk
depicts the Battle of Dunkirk which took place during World War II. As France fell and the German army advanced on Allied forces, Dunkirk became the focal point for what would become one of the greatest evacuations in military history. Code-named ‘Operation Dynamo’, more than 330,000 British, French, Belgian and Polish troops were rescued from the beaches of Dunkirk between 26 May and 3 June 1940.,At the Science Museum you can watch
Dunkirk
on one of the largest IMAX screens in the UK (on 70mm IMAX film) and also see a real Royal Air Force Supermarine Spitfire and Hawker Hurricane (which fought over Dunkirk and in the Battle of Britain) in our
Flight Gallery
.,Contrary to common knowledge of the events at Dunkirk, the RAF made a significant contribution to the evacuation of Allied forces. Although soldiers on the beach believed they had been abandoned as they could not see Allied aircraft, the RAF were fighting the Luftwaffe (German air force) over the English Channel.,In May 1940, the RAF faced its first true test against an experienced Luftwaffe. Tasked with protecting the evacuating troops during Operation Dynamo, the RAF targeted the advancing German army and fought Ju 87 Stukas, Messerschmitt 109s and Heinkel 111s high in the sky. As well as an original Supermarine Spitfire and Hawker Hurricane, you can also view scale models of the German Messerschmitt Bf 109 and the Ju 87 Stuka in our Flight Gallery.,A British legend, the Supermarine Mk1 Spitfire was integral to Britain’s front-line air defence during World War II. Together with the Hawker Hurricane, both aircraft played a key role in Operation Dynamo and the Battle of Britain in 1940. Powered by the new Rolls-Royce Merlin engine (on display in our
Making the Modern World Gallery
) the Spitfire and Hurricane along with the Royal Navy, provided enough cover at Dunkirk to allow the Allied troops time to evacuate the beach.,As depicted in the film, the amount of fuel each RAF aircraft could carry severely limited their flight time. Once the pilot made it across the English Channel, there was only enough fuel for one hour of fighting over Dunkirk before the pilot had to return to Britain to refuel. Often, Spitfires and Hurricanes met the Luftwaffe on route to Dunkirk as bombers targeted Royal Navy ships and destroyers. Pilots were forced to battle the Germans over the sea, leaving the aircraft with little or no fuel left to continue onto France.,The Hawker Hurricane on display in the Science Museum’s Flight Gallery fought over Dunkirk and in the Battle of Britain.,It was piloted by P.O. Anthony Woods-Scawen of 43 Squadron from Tangmere and took part in the defensive patrol over Dunkirk beaches. It attacked and damaged two Me 109s, but was hit and forced to land back in Tangmere. After some repairs, it relocated to the No 615 ‘County of Surrey’ Squadron. Piloted by P.O. David Looker, it was attacked by a Bf 109 and crash-landed on fire at Croydon aerodrome in August 1940.,The Hurricane was slower than the Spitfire, but was a much sturdier machine, able to withstand heavier battle-damage. It could be maintained and repaired more easily than the Spitfire. The Hurricane made up more than 60 percent of RAF fighter strength during the Battle of Britain in the summer of 1940. Due to its slower speed, Hurricanes usually attacked opposing bombers, such as Heinkel 111s and Ju 87 Stukas, while Spitfires went after the bomber escorts like Messerschmitt Bf/Me 109s, which were much quicker. The Hurricane accounted for the greatest number of enemy aircraft destroyed in the Battle of Britain.,Many who fought and were evacuated at Dunkirk never saw the RAF in amongst the terrifying dive-bombing Stukas or the Heinkel 111s as they dropped bomb after bomb on Royal Navy ships and soldiers stranded on the beach. In reality, the Spitfire and Hurricane were critical components in the successful Allied evacuation."

","Collections and Objects,Exhibitions and Galleries","biology,chemistry,medicine,weather","In early September 1766,
John Dalton
was born. He was fascinated by colour blindness, the weather and had one of the most important ideas in the history of science.,Dalton was born in a remote village called Eaglesfield in Cumbria, northwest England, on or around 6 September 1766. His parents were Quakers and Dalton had a modest upbringing.,From childhood, Dalton showed himself to be both clever and inquisitive. He attended the local village school, where he took on a teaching position from the age of 12.,By 15 he was helping his brother, Jonathan, run a Quaker boarding school in Kendal, where they taught subjects ranging from ancient Greek to hydraulics.,Whilst at Kendal, Dalton made the acquaintance of John Gough, a blind scholar and keen amateur meteorologist who helped stimulate Dalton’s lifelong love of science.,Gough encouraged Dalton to start a daily weather diary, which he kept for 57 years. Dalton made over 200,000 observations – often with the help of home-built instruments – and completed his last entry just hours before he died.,Dalton’s weather data provided the material for his first book –

– published in 1793.,That year Dalton left Kendal to take up a teaching position at a Presbyterian college in Manchester.,Resigning from the post six years later, he turned to private tutoring to earn a living. Among his pupils was
James Prescott Joule
, the scientist who gave his name to the standard unit of energy – the
joule
.,Once resident in Manchester, Dalton became a member of the
Literary and Philosophical Society
– a discussion group set up to share scientific ideas at a time when science had yet to become a profession. Here he was given access to a well-equipped research laboratory and his scientific output flourished.,Though criticised for the quality of his experiments, Dalton was an enthusiastic investigator who worked late most evenings. In later years he wore a thinking cap, which is now on display at the
Museum of Science and Industry
in Manchester.,In total, Dalton presented over 100 papers to the society,
becoming its president
in 1816. One of the earliest papers Dalton presented was on colour blindness – from which both he and his brother suffered.,Colour blindness, he concluded, was caused by a discolouration of the gel-like substance that fills the middle of the eye, known as the vitreous humour.,To test his theory Dalton donated his eyes for examination after death. Autopsy proved his theory to be incorrect. His eyes were retained and DNA analysis in 1995 (150 years after his death) revealed that Dalton suffered from red-green colour blindness – a condition still referred to as
daltonism
.,In 1808 Dalton placed the idea of the atom on a solid scientific footing with the publication of his book
A New System of Chemical Philosophy
.,Chemical elements, he declared, are made of atoms of different weights that combine to form new substances – or compounds. During chemical reactions atoms are never created, destroyed or transformed – simply rearranged.,Dalton imagined atoms as solid, hard spheres. In 1810 he asked an engineering friend, Peter Ewart, to make a set of
wooden ball-and-stick models
to use as teaching aids.,They remain the first known models of atoms and are currently on display in our Dalton anniversary showcase.,Although Dalton’s atomic theory took a long time to be accepted – and not everything he came up with was true – his ideas still form the cornerstone of chemistry today.,In keeping with his Quaker upbringing Dalton lived a humble life and steered clear of public acclaim as far as possible.,He was nonetheless widely honoured in his lifetime, receiving honorary degrees from the universities of Oxford and Edinburgh.,Dalton was especially loved by the people of Manchester. The city paid for a
life-size statue
to be erected during his lifetime and filed past his coffin in their tens of thousands as he lay in state.,Nine years later they paid for a granite monument to be erected alongside his grave in
Ardwick cemetery
.,The Dalton anniversary display is on the ground floor of the Science Museum until late 2017."

You can help scientists to explore the mystery of sleep by taking part in a huge online experiment, on
worldslargestsleepstudy.com
.,The experiment uses an approach that I helped to develop for
a mass participation study of intelligence
with Adrian Owen and his team from the University of Western Ontario, when 110,000 people took part and the results were published in the journal
Neuron
.,For the sleep study, which he briefly discussed with me at a recent
Lates in the Science Museum
, participants will undergo a series of intelligence tests designed to trigger activity in as much of the brain’s anatomy as possible, combining the fewest tasks to cover the broadest range of cognitive skills.,Every participant will be asked to complete the tests before going to bed at night, as well as completing a questionnaire about lifestyle and personal details,They will then be asked to complete the tests again when they wake up, and provide details about when they went to bed, when they woke up and what sort of night’s sleep they got.,If you take part, you will learn how long you slept relative to the rest of the population, whether you retired to bed earlier or later than others and so on, as well as insights into your cognitive performance.,And you will be invited to have a second go, after a night that was as different as possible as the one you had the first time around.,The issue is important, says Owen, because many professions encourage or require frequent sleep deprivation, notably in healthcare, transport and law enforcement. Productivity lost due to sleepy brains costs countries billions – one 2016 study concluded the impact was an
estimated $50 billion in the UK alone
.,At the level of an individual, being awake for 18 hours had an effect on cognition equivalent to being mildly intoxicated, said Owen.,But there is still a lot to learn, he says: which groups of people are most susceptible to the effects of sleep deprivation? Does the effect of sleep on cognition change with age?,We know that elderly people require less sleep, but does that interfere with their cognitive performance? Does the time you go to sleep matter – or is the secret just to make sure you get enough hours in?,And finally, we all know that getting a good night’s sleep is important for brain health, but how much sleep is enough?,A pilot study by Owen of around 500 people already shows that less sleep harms reasoning and memory, while verbal skills are less impaired, suggesting that those brain systems that are responsible for high-level decision making, planning and problem solving may be disproportionately affected by not having enough sleep – including, paradoxically, the ability to detect that deprivation has made your performance below par.,,Owen will also discuss his sleep experiment with me later this year at the
Manchester Science Festival

Museum of Tomorrow
in Rio were awarded a grant from the British Council, through its Newton Fund Institutional Skills call. It was a thrilling moment to get the result, we all celebrated it, and are now working as hard as we can to make sure the execution lives up to our proposal. Our proposal was to use food as an overarching theme for future activities. We’ve planned to do this through our teams internally, our partners at the Science Museum and the restaurants and local community near our museum in Rio de Janeiro’s port region. This beautiful part of the city was recently declared a world heritage site by UNESCO.,It was late on a Wednesday evening when my trip to London to visit the Science Museum was finally confirmed. Despite the pressure of winning the grant I didn’t feel anxious about travelling. What I was anxious about were the questions that often arise when we’re working on a project: What will the real social impact of this project be? Will it be as great as we expect or will it fall short of our objectives? What new lessons will we learn either way?,The project the grant will contribute towards is one looking at tackling food waste in Rio. We plan to do this by helping restaurateurs to better manage their processes around cooking, storage and use of food in their businesses. In this way we hope the project will benefit not only the environment but each of the restaurants themselves. We also want to combat malnutrition and hidden hunger among the communities near our museum, by teaching them about reducing food wastage and the possibilities of urban gardening. In addition, we also want to exchange knowledge and expertise with our partners at the Science Museum in the UK on the development of exhibitions on food and agriculture.,My trip to London marked the first of a series of workshops we’ll hold at our Museums. The Science Museum is regarded as one of finest museums in the world, both in the way it ignites public engagement with science and as a collection of fascinating objects. It was a privilege to see how such a great institution works from an insider’s point of view; the conception and execution of galleries and exhibitions, how content planning and audience research are carried out, and how all these different elements come together to make a project come to fruition.,It was wonderful getting to visit the museum and see objects like the Soyuz capsule British astronaut Tim Peake used return to Earth from the ISS. I was even able to experience the feeling of being inside it through a new virtual reality experience at the museum. I also got to explore a beautiful new gallery, Mathematics: The Winton Gallery, designed by the late architect Zaha Hadid. The Science Museum is a great example of how historical artifacts and contemporary science can co-exist in a space that has seen generations of visitors walk through its doors. And what’s more, it was fantastic to see that the Science Museum partners not only with other museums in the Science Museum Group, but also has successful partnerships with organisations such as the Natural History Museum, V&A, Wellcome and the Francis Crick Institute.,Meeting colleagues as passionate as we are in Rio about making science accessible, to raise public debates, to inform, entertain and educate, was terrific. Since our inception two years ago we have worked hard to establish ourselves as a world-class museum and have developed our expertise in community outreach, greeting over two million visitors in the process. We hope that this partnership will allow us to develop further. Despite our differences it surprised me that some of the challenges we have in Brazil are quite similar those faced by our counterparts in the UK. I feel really inspired by the possibility of using our combined knowledge to tackle these challenges and know that this sharing of resources will make the bond between the Science Museum and Museum of Tomorrow even stronger.,What I observed in London has already influenced our practices in Brazil. In July we shared ideas in the second workshop within our ‘Food Project’ by hosting two Science Museum staff members with us at the Museum of Tomorrow who will be sharing their experience of creating object displays and planning educational activities for agriculture. The Science Museum will also be hosting two staff members from our museum. I hope this exchange of skills will be a positive experience for all involved, with the increased knowledge and new experiences enriching both museums."

Bradley Wiggins
in the time trial (and fingers crossed not!)- here’s some ideas to put his bike to good use to:,This stange looking contraption is known as a radium ‘bomb’.
Radium
was a radioactive source used to give radiotherapy for cancer treatment in the 1930s at
Westminster Hospital
.  The radium was placed in the egg-shaped lead-lined head (known as the ‘bomb’) and a bicycle break cable enabled doctors to expose patients to the radium by opening and closing the shutter at a distance – helping them to avoid exposure to the radiation.,This ‘exo-skeleton’  leg frame was designed to relieve pressure on the joints of people with arthritis. It features an adapted bicycle seat to help the user to rest their weight when strapped into the frame.,Perhaps our star object is the
Stoke Mandeville Hospital
bed cycle – which employed bike chain and cassette to help injured WW2 veterans rebuild strength in arms and lengths by pushing pedals. Stoke Mandeville Hospital was the site for the games that went on to become the
Paralympics
.,Cycling is clearly not just a recent passion. A number of tattoo’s in our collection, dating from around the 1890s show a great love for the sport.,It would be interesting to know whether many of the GB Team have taken their passion for cycling as far inking the skin. Anyway – good luck to Wiggins and all the cyclists – let’s hope they strike gold!,PS. Yay – Gold! Congratulations to Bradley Wiggins for winning the time trial. Ok so he wasn’t ever in danger of needing to break up his bike for hospital parts.,,"

Novel methods for early detection are continuously under development, including the latest diagnostic approach: biopsy – by breath.,Breath biopsies involve analysing breath for the presence of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are key biomarkers in certain cancers and brain tumours. However, reliably capturing VOCs can be tricky but one company believes they have the answer.,Currently undergoing clinical trials, the ReCIVA breath sampler is the brain-child of
Owlstone Medical
. It can collect up to four breath samples, from different areas of the lungs, at any one time. The captured breath is monitored by pressure and CO2 sensors in the sampler. Depending on the disease, different concentrations of VOCs are present in different breath fractions, so the ability to obtain separate samples is extremely useful for diagnosing.,Two pairs of polymer-based sorbent tubes are used to collect the samples, which can then be stored or directly analysed using a variety of techniques. Doctors believe that a unique fingerprint of VOCs will be found upon analysis if cancer is present.
The ReCIVA breath sampler is currently undergoing four large-scale clinical trials, with the hope of getting the technology into hospitals and GP surgeries before the end of the year. In research carried out by CRUK Cambridge Centre, the University of Cambridge and Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, patients admitted to Addenbrookes Hospital with suspected cancer will undergo breath biopsies using the ReCIVA to collect samples. These samples will be analysed in Owlstone Medical’s clinical laboratory, to assess whether there are reliable levels of biomarkers present to distinguish those with cancer from the healthy population.,If successful, the highly sensitive, non-invasive detection method could help provide a cheap and accurate first screening of patients before the employment of expensive imaging methods like CT scans. This has the potential to significantly speed up diagnostics for cancer and other diseases, saving thousands of lives.,The ReCIVA breath sampler will be on display in our interactive

The single issue that most preoccupies thinking about science research policy has remained constant for more than two decades: what policies will best support translation of laboratory brainwaves into commercial success for UK PLC.,The perennial problems of turning scientific excellence into commercial success without damaging the research base was the central issue discussed at a remarkable gathering of the individuals who have been in charge of British science since the early 1990s, held at the
Science Museum
and cosponsored by the
Mile End Group of Queen Mary University of London
, and the
Royal Society
.,The Minister responsible for science, David Willetts MP, was joined by Lord Waldegrave, Science Minister from 1992-1994 (and former Chair of Trustees of the Science Museum) and Lord Sainsbury, Minister for Science 1998-2006 in an event chaired by the historian Lord Hennessy.,Before them was a who’s who of the British scientific establishment, including the current Chief Scientist Sir John Beddington and his predecessors, Sir Bill Stewart, and Lord May. There were former vice-chancellors too, Sir John Ashworth (Salford and LSE), Sir Alan Wilson (Leeds), Sir Roger Williams (Reading) and the current VC of Queen Mary University of London, Simon Gaskell. Others guests included Sir Walter Bodmer who chaired the first committee to explore Public Understanding of Science and Sir Geoffrey Allen, founding Secretary of the Science and Engineering Research Council in 1981.,The problems of managing science have not fundamentally changed in half a century, and David Willetts emphasised continuity between Lord Waldegrave’s White Paper “
Realising our Potential
” (1993), Lord Sainsbury’s “
Race to the Top
” (2007) and Willetts’ current concerns with helping British industry avoid the ‘Valley of Death, where projects are considered too embryonic for industry to fund and too commercial to be backed by the research councils.,David Willetts emphasised his belief that greater American success in taking university innovations to market was the result of better American government support measures than any cultural differences. Innovations by American scientists receive support at an earlier stage from American government measures than their British counterparts, which enables the US industry to take lower risks when delivering a novel technology to a market. But a note of warning and wise advice based on hard experience was given by Lord Waldegrave, who commented that put scientists and politicians too close together nearly always ends in catastrophe. Lord Sainsbury pointed out that offering to contribute to solving the problems that bedevil the Treasury is a better approach to the extraction of resources than demanding support.,Lord Sainsbury questioned the assumption that public knowledge of science would lead to the public boosting its appetite for science. However, Sir Walter Bodmer pointed out that his committee never believed that widespread knowledge of science would equal public understanding of it, but was rather a prerequisite. This distinction had got lost subsequently. Regulation also has a role, with Sir John Ashworth pointing out the role of research-supported standards and regulation was one way to ensure the best quality in industry.,The speakers vigorously agreed that it was in the interest of British industry to have strong government funded research institutes in a landmark meeting that distilled some of the basic truths to emerge from science policy over the past few decades.,A number of tweets from the night have been
storified

The Energy Show
is lab assistant i-nstein. Nina Dunn, responsible for Video Design and Animation Direction, and Mike Wyatt from Attack Animation were the masterminds behind bringing i-nstein to life. Take a look at their process here.,Design:
We started off with a few rough pencil sketches. Then some orthographic representations of the sketches were created in Photoshop. Extra detail was added into the basic form to add interest.,,3D Model:
Using a 3D computer program such as ‘Maya’, the orthographic illustrations are used as reference to build i-nstein as a 3D polygonal model. The pink dots in the middle image are the vertices of the model. A ‘vertex’ is a point in 3D space. The blue lines are the ‘edges’ of the polygons, they are drawn between two vertices. A ‘face’ can be rendered between at least three vertices.  It is best to use 4 vertices for each face, so the polygon which is drawn has 4 vertices and 4 edges draw between these vertices. We call these polygons ‘quads.’,,Rigging:
The next stage is called ‘rigging.’ This is where the puppet strings are built into the geometric model. The individual elements such as the eyebrows, the moustache, and the goggles are ‘skinned’ to curves and joints, before being placed under the influence of ‘controller curves.’ It is then possible to ‘pose’ each element of the model, and to achieve different emotions in the way in which each controller is positioned.,,https://youtu.be/_gaJtKKZJ-U,Texturing:
The ‘texturing’ process is where we add colour and shading to the model.  The geometry is ‘mapped’, as if you were skinning an animal, so that the surface is laid out on a flat, 2D image. This is called ‘UV Mapping’. Using Photoshop, colour information can be painted onto these flat images, which the computer then wraps back around the model.,,Animation:
i-nstein is animated by posing him in different positions over time. The animator sets ‘keys’ on the time-line, and the computer fills in the spaces between the key frames. Once the animation is complete, a low quality ‘playblast’ movie is created so that the director can sign off the animation before the character is lit and rendered.,,https://youtu.be/D3hZ6O1oVxk,Lighting:
Once the animation of a shot is complete, the model is replaced with a higher resolution ‘mesh.’ This Mesh has a much higher ‘poly-count’ than the low quality ‘proxy mesh’ used for animation. The more polygons the software has to display, the slower the feedback, so this is why make the substitution at this stage. Once the lighter is happy with the general mood and look of this view a render can be made.,,Rendering:
A ‘render’ is a high quality, full resolution image of a particular frame of the animation. It brings all of the underlying elements together and outputs them as one single file. It can take a very long time for the computer to calculate. It took 60 seconds per frame to render i-nstein. There are 25 frames per second. To render 1 second of animation took 25 minutes. We produced about 9 minutes of animation, which took 225 hours to render.
That’s almost
9 and a half days of rendering!,,https://youtu.be/0-LSMagDPZo,i-nstein is starring in Science Museum Live: The Energy Show at the Science Museum until 31 August.

","Collections and Objects,Education,Exhibitions and Galleries",time,"Clockmaker Anna-Rose Kirk reflects on designing The Horizon Clock, a contemporary clock which references time’s relationship with nature.,Before clocks, time was synonymous with nature. For thousands of years, human beings used the natural world to tell the time. The path of the Sun was used to measure a day, the phases of the Moon for a month and the position of the stars were used in many complex ways to measure hours, months and years. The Ancient Egyptians used the star Sothis, now known as
Sirius
, the Dog Star, to signal the beginning of the season in which the Nile floods, thus heralding the start of a new year. Many cultures worldwide have had diverse ways of telling the time throughout history, some even used
sounds and smells in nature
.,To give a more accurate idea of time, people created instruments, harnessing nature to break the day into smaller amounts. Examples include,
sundials
which use the sun’s shadow to tell the time;
clepsydras
, water clocks which measure time using the regulated flow of liquid into or out from a vessel; and
astrolabes
, which predict the positions of the Sun, Moon, planets, and stars, and determine local time.
Telling the time with an astrolabe
also told you about your position in the universe.,In the modern age, where we are able to tell the time instantly and to amazing accuracy, it is easy to forget that essentially time is just a measure of where we are in the natural orbit of the Earth around the Sun, the Earth’s rotation on its axis and the Moon’s orbit around the Earth.,The Horizon Clock reminds us of this fact by indicating the path of the Sun across the sky allowing us to see how much day light remains and how much darkness is coming. Its single hand rotates once a day, allowing for an approximate indication of the time on the ring of 24 numbers. Two arms indicate the times of sunrise and sunset throughout the year. The sunburst pointer represents the sun’s daily journey across the sky and beneath the horizon at night. The clock reflects on the idea that time is intrinsically linked with the steady paths of the Earth and the Sun.,What other technologies help people to connect to or utilise nature?,The Clockmakers’ Museum
at
the Science Museum is home to the world’s oldest clock and watch collection. It maps the history of watch and clock making from 1600 to the present day. The Horizon Clock will be on display as part of the collection until May 2016."

Beyond the Lab: The DIY Science Revolution
.,Exploration and discovery is super exciting and it becomes even better when done together. That’s why we have an open public laboratory in Amsterdam where anyone triggered by the prospect of possibly finding something new can start experimenting. The laboratory focuses on biology, because that’s the field in which there is still so much unknown and it may hold the key to solving grand challenges such as climate change, energy supply, hunger and disease. For example, at the moment a number of regular users are searching for new antibiotics.,Antibiotics are drugs that can cure microbial infections, such as pneumonia and urinary tract infections. However, since the microbes that cause these diseases are able to adapt, the drugs become ineffective over time. This is why there is a constant need for new antibiotics.,In our lab we host weekly open evenings and often special workshops to which anyone is invited with an interest in joining this search. We dug into soil to look for antibiotics, made extracts from plants and recently started exploring the potential use of insects. And since our lab is close to Amsterdam’s Chinatown, an interest has grown in unraveling the mysteries of traditional Chinese medicine.,Especially an extract from a fungus called Cordyceps militaris has sparked some enthusiasm. It is known for turning ants into zombies, by growing parasitically on their bodies and a powder of these fungi can be found in Chinese pharmacies. Zoran Radiceski, a regular user of the lab, has pitched the idea to cultivate the fungus at an opening evening. Others were intrigued too, and now we have multiple petridishes with Cordyceps militaris growing in our incubator. Ready to make extracts and test against reference strains.,It is an excellent example of how community biolabs work. The audience of a typical open lab evening attracts people from very diverse backgrounds: biologists, engineers, artists, designers and other people with a curious mind. Together they come up with research questions, often about something they have been wondering about for a very long time. And together they come up with a plan to take action.,Sounds like an expensive hobby? Not really, actually. Although the equipment in a professional lab can easily add up to tens of thousands, others within our biolab community work on making lab equipment themselves. Assembled as much as possible from off-the-shelve parts combined with parts they design themselves and create using a 3D printer or lasercutter.,That’s what we did to produce the setup of devices and plates that are now on display in
Beyond the Lab: The DIY Science Revolution
as well. The incubator, centrifuge, microscope and spectrometer can be made in any workshop. The centrifuge is for example made from the rotor of a toy helicopter and the lenses in the microscope are taken out of a disposable camera.,And now that the antibiotics research is scaling up we clearly need a new device: an automatic antibiotic testing machine. Because pouring all those petridishes, introducing extracts and reference microbes by hand is a lot of work. However, it does remind us that discovery does not come easy.,Beyond the Lab: The DIY Science Revolution

I joined with other families to set up this group because I was concerned about the dangerous levels of air pollution where my children go to school and play.,In order to have the concerns of I Like Clean Air addressed by local government, we decided to try our hand at collecting scientific data. In October 2014, we hit the streets of Hackney in East London and put up diffusion tubes, which collect air and are used to test for pollution levels, some of which are on display at the Science Museum. Back then, we found that pollution levels in our local area broke annual legal limits within just four weeks. Being able to carry out scientific research ourselves means that a grassroots organisation like I Like Clean Air can gather the right knowledge to speak to the local authorities about fixing the problem.,In June, we took a trip to the Houses of Parliament where 25 school children sang

The kids wear campaign t-shirts and get involved handing out flyers and making posters at school. We were also able to donate some of these items to this exhibition at the Science Museum, in order to show how citizen science empowers us all, including children, to fight for change.,Equipped with scientific data, our aim is to make people pay attention to our concerns and help us to drive real change in our community.

X-ray crystallography

’s 24th Annual Distinguished Lecture (listen
here
). In front of a packed IMAX theatre at the Science Museum, Ellen took us through some of the extraordinary advances in science, technology and engineering resulting from exploration of space, and the challenges even now being worked on by scientists across the world driven by NASA’s
journey to Mars
.,One of the great unknowns for us here on Earth is whether we’re alone in the universe – NASA’s Journey to Mars mission is working to get closer to the answer. Why Mars? The obvious answer would be that it is our planetary neighbour but what makes it an exciting prospect in the search for life beyond earth – is water. Mars is marked all over with signs that water once persisted on the surface – the ragged surface on the red planet could be compared to some of the great geological masterpieces shaped by bodies of water over millennia here on Earth – and then in 2008 the
Phoenix lander
took a sample of ice.,How do we begin such a search? What next steps do we need to take?,Ellen began by highlighting the importance of international co-operation in order to achieve this grand goal of going to Mars. She outlined tremendous work already achieved through combined efforts – particularly noting the extraordinary
Philae landing
this month as well as the ongoing work through the
International Space Station
, saying that in her view such a collaboration is worthy of a Nobel Prize. Although they are extraordinary, exploration by rovers and landers is very slow and limited – having scientists on Mars would dramatically change the scope of exploration and the timescale of discoveries.,We heard of the science, engineering and technology challenges that
NASA
has mapped out and how they, along with international and commercial partners, are going about finding answers. Getting people safely landed on Mars (and back again!) is not possible, yet – but Ellen said she expects it to happen in the 2030s. To get there, the challenges range from how to safely land a heavy craft in a thin and changing atmosphere, and how to keep Mars clean from contamination by microorganisms from earth, to ensuring that astronauts not only survive the eight month journey and landing but are healthy and able to work once they arrive – for instance combatting the muscle wasting and bone density loss that usually occurs in microgravity.,Another challenge is making the mission as efficient as possible – mass affects everything. NASA astronauts are already able to recycle 80% of the water they use, but as Ellen said – don’t think about that for too long. Other challenges you might not think about straight away – such as making sure dust from Mars isn’t brought into the spacecraft. But when you think about it, at zero gravity dust could cause havoc! But perhaps the dust could be put to good use – with the developments in
3D printers
a next step being investigated as part of the ‘in situ resource utilisation’ research is how to use Martian rock to manufacture spare parts, rather than having to transport powder manufactured on Earth.,In the post-lecture Q&A one of the questions was on the timescale of decisions on future missions and investments. This highlighted the disconnect between the short-term, politically driven timescales of public funding and the long-term nature of NASA projects – a challenge not unfamiliar to UK scientists.,And of course in order to achieve NASA’s mission to Mars, and meet the many other great challenges faced closer to home, we need young people with creativity and ambition to become the next generation scientists and engineers. Ellen was animated about importance of inspiring young people about science and certainly did her bit on Friday (I saw one little girl grinning ear to ear holding a shiny new NASA badge)!,It is hard to do justice to the inspirational talk given by Dr Stofan in the awesome IMAX theatre at the Science Museum, so I recommend listening to the audio recording of the lecture itself (

Finding the perfect gift or decoration can be expensive, time-consuming and exhausting. Could the rise of
3D printing
provide the answer to our seasonal woes and even tap into our hidden creativity?,Earlier this month we were pleased to unveil a dramatic 3D printed titanium star, which sits on top of the Director’s Christmas tree. The star, which measures 44cm wide, is an awe-inspiring example of what can be achieved on a 3D printer. The star’s design is based on fractals, the self-repeating patterns found within a
Mandelbrot set
.,The star was the result of a challenge set by the Science Museum’s Director Ian Blatchford at last year’s Christmas party. Attendees to the event were challenged to come up with an innovative design for a star – to be created and displayed on our Christmas tree.,Conceived and designed by London based designer
Jessica Noble
, with help from
Nottingham University
, the star features a central nylon core and 97 3D printed individual titanium stars printed by
Renishaw
that were then connected to the core using carbon fibre rods. The individual parts make the star easy to assemble, dissemble and rearrange – a clear advantage over other types of decoration. The Mandelbrot reference gives a nod to the Science Museum’s
mathematical collections
.,However, you don’t need to be an artist or designer to take advantage of the benefits of 3D printing. Many printers are now available on the high street and can produce smaller scale designs of your choice. Our Inventor in Residence,
Mark Champkins
, has taken advantage of the technology by creating a range of decorations and gift tags for the Science Museum’s shop that can be 3D printed in under 15 minutes.,As the museum’s store now sells
3D printers
, we’ve set one up to demonstrate how the technology works. Should you wish to buy a decoration such as a snowflake or star, you can choose a design and watch it being printed – ready for you to take home. Why not pay a visit to the museum and try it out?,The link between science and design was the topic of
a recent debate
held jointly at the Science Museum and
Design Museum
and attended by Universities and Science Minister, David Willets MP. Organised with the
Technology Strategy Board
(TSB) and the
Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council
, the debate focused on breaking down language barriers and encouraging interaction between scientists, engineers and designers explained David Bott, Director of Innovation Programmes at the TSB.,3D printing is rapidly changing society – whether at home, work or our leisure activities. You can find more examples of how the technology is growing in our free exhibition,
3D: Printing The Future
, which showcases over 600 3D printed objects including prototypes for replacement body organs, bike gadgets and aeroplane parts."

You can put your intelligence to the ultimate test and see how you fare compared with others by visiting the Cognitron website
here
.,Over a period of half an hour the AI will put you through a series of customised tests and, after you have supplied a few details, tell you how well you performed.,Information gleaned from around 200 people at a time will be analysed by the AI to progressively improve its repertoire of brain teasers, you can read the full story in the latest issue of Wired, online
today
.,The AI developed by a team of psychologists, neuroscientists and engineers at Imperial’s Computational, Cognitive and Clinical Neuroimaging Laboratory, ‘C3NL’, depends on Bayesian Optimization. This system is named after the 18th-century Presbyterian minister Thomas Bayes, who devised a systematic way of calculating from an assumption the way the world works and what how the likelihood of something happening changes as new facts emerge.,In this mass experiment, the Imperial team hopes to follow up an earlier online test by Adam Hampshire, Adrian Owen from Cambridge’s Cognition Brain Sciences Unit and myself, when I edited
New Scientist
.,We were amazed when more than 100,000 people took part, and published the results in 2012 in the journal
Neuron
. Based on the data gathered, Adam Hampshire’s statistical analysis suggested that a single number, IQ, could not capture all facets of human intelligence and that at least three factors were needed: short-term memory; reasoning; and, finally, a verbal factor, (read the blog post we published back in 2012 for
more
).,Were these three factors underpinned by three brain circuits? Different circuits did indeed seem to be involved when the Canadian team did a follow-up study of 16 people with a $5 million fMRI scanner. In a way we had distilled intelligence into fractions.,The idea that general intelligence rests on collaborating circuits had been suggested before, notably by John Duncan at the Medical Research Council’s Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, Cambridge. Two of our intelligence factors – working memory and reasoning – corresponded to circuits that Duncan had already identified as being central to human intelligence, suggesting that we were on the right track.,But a broadside published in the journal Intelligence concluded that our results ‘depend on a number of assumptions and subjective decisions that, at best, allow for different interpretations. Ultimately, we as humans are not unbiased enough’ remarked Romy Lorenz.,To remove subjectivity, she and her Imperial supervisor Rob Leech developed the
Automatic Neuroscientist
, with the help of Prof Giovanni Montanna from King’s College London and his doctoral student, Ricardo Pio Monti.,,First, they started out with a well-understood toy problem to make sure that the AI based approach worked: could the AI present more than 300 combinations of sounds and images of varying complexity to human subjects in a brain scanner to figure out which combinations were most able to turn their visual cortex on and auditory cortex off? It did, after six minutes. Leech was ecstatic: ‘That is when we realised that it was the first general purpose Automatic Neuroscientist.’,In collaboration with Hampshire, they went on to show the power of the Automatic Neuroscientist with a pilot brain imaging study on 21 volunteers from their lab who performed 16 different cognitive tasks. The machine was asked to find which brain circuits were activated by each task, including some from the 2012 Neuron paper.,Two tasks cleanly harnessed independent circuits, both from the 2012 paper: Deductive Reasoning, when subjects have to spot the ‘odd one out’, and the Tower of London task, where they are shown a tree-like frame festooned with numbered beads, then asked to put the beads in the right order. Confirmation of two of the three circuits identified by the 2012 paper was encouraging but, as Hampshire says, probably “sheer, blind, luck.”,Still, many of their peers are impressed with the Automatic Neuroscientist.,‘This framework is very promising,’ comments Thomas Yeo of the National University of Singapore, who uses machine learning in brain imaging. It is ‘strikingly innovative,’ adds Chris Gorgolewski of the Stanford Center for Reproducible Neuroscience, who thinks it could be extended to make neuroscience more automated and thus more reproducible.,,The work is ‘potentially very exciting,’ adds John Duncan. ‘Experimental psychology has always been dogged by uncertainty over how well findings generalise from one apparently similar task to another.’ Peter Coveney of University College London, critic of the blind application of machine learning to big data, adds: ‘This is an eminently sensible approach, combining underpinning hypotheses of brain function with machine learning to highly effectively reveal unexpected modes of human thought.’,To turn the AI into a cloud-based test that could be done online, the team worked with Pete Hellyer, a Wellcome Trust fellow at C3NL, along with William Trender. The aim of the new online study launched today is, as Hampshire puts it, to see if they can ‘develop an AI machine that can work out the major components of human intelligence, that is completely unbiased, with large amounts of data and by harnessing the ability to learn in an iterative manner.’,The ramifications are even broader. Leech believes machine intelligence can erase subjectivity from research. Machines could design and run experiments and help usher in a better way to do science. No wonder that it has been backed by the Medical Research Council and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council.,Visit the Cognitron

But have you ever wondered what kind of medicine Scott and his party brought with them to the ends of the earth? Here at the Science Museum we know because we have one Scott’s original aluminium medicine chests. The chest, dated to 1910, was
carried by Scott and his party
when they set out for the pole in November 1911. This chest was originally kept at the Lower Glacier Depot on the way to the Pole, however it was picked up when Scott’s second in command
Lieutenant Edward Evans
began his return journey to the Cape. It was only recovered in 1912 when a search party set out to find Scott and his comrades, whose bodies were discovered 11 miles out from the
One Ton Depot
.,This medicine chest can tell us about the kind of drugs indispensible to Scott and his comrades. Plastic bottles containing Paregoric Elixir (Camphorated Tincture of Opium) and Aromatic Powder tablets (chalk and opium) are to be found within this chest. Opium was a useful sedative and pain reliever. Additional phials of hypodermic tablets of cocaine and morphine would have been administered by injection in cases of extreme trauma.,The chest contains other hazardous chemicals such as strychnine, belladonna, arsenic, and mercury – medicines that would have been used as irritants to bring on a sweat; a common nineteenth century remedy for fever.,,Although it is worth considering how modern medicines may have aided early explorers, we know that even the most efficacious of drugs could not have helped Scott or his team survive the Antarctic storms.,Written by Kristin Hussey and Luke Pomeroy, Collections Information Officers"

Dame Margaret Weston
. Dame Margaret worked at the Museum for many years, joining in 1955 and becoming Director in 1973, succeeding Sir David Follett. She remained in the position until 1986 when the first Launchpad interactive gallery was opened.,Dame Margaret oversaw a significant expansion of what is now known as the
Science Museum Group
. On her first day as Director, Dame Margaret was in York, announcing the city as the home of the
National Railway Museum
(NRM). NRM opened in 1975, followed in 1983 by the
National Media Museum
in Bradford (known then as the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television). This period also saw the acquisition of a large former airfield at Wroughton, near Swindon, in 1979 to allow the development of collections of larger objects such as planes and submarines.,Other highlights under Dame Margaret’s leadership include the acquisition of
Concorde 002
which is now housed on our behalf at the Fleet Air Arm Museum Yeovilton. Dame Margaret described how the Museum acquired Concorde, saying ‘I had a telephone call – it was all telephone calls in those earlier days, not e-mails – and the man didn’t give his name or his department. But he just said, do you want Concorde 002? It’s coming to the end of its test service. And I said, well I want to preserve it but I have no place to put it. But yes I’ll take it.’,Dame Margaret shared

Sophie Waring
and Assistant Curator
Rupert Cole
explore the story behind the purchase of Joseph Priestley’s microscope, part of the Science Museum collection since 1954.,On this day (15 September) in 1767 the famed theologian and natural philosopher Joseph Priestley walked into 171 Fleet Street – the shop of London’s renowned scientific instrument-maker Benjamin Martin – to buy a
microscope
.,The Science Museum has in its collections the very same microscope. But, much more remarkably, the Museum also has Priestley’s original shop
receipt
.,Such ephemera rarely survives the course of history. To have evidence of a transaction between a notable instrument maker and such a famous figure in the history of science makes this example very special.,Priestley, along with Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Antoine Lavoisier, has a claim to the discovery of oxygen after isolating it in a gaseous state in 1774.,While we don’t know exactly what research Priestley carried out with the Martin microscope, there is record in his correspondence of why he decided to buy it.,In April 1767 Priestley was getting ready to leave Warrington Academy, where he was tutor of modern languages and rhetoric. Seeking advice from a fellow natural philosopher John Canton, Priestley wrote:,“At Warrington, I have the use of a pretty good apparatus; but I am about to remove to Leeds [to take up the ministry at Mill Hill chapel], and therefore shall have occasion to purchase several for myself, to complete my own set of instruments. … I want chiefly a good microscope … the plainer and cheaper the better.”,The original letter is held in the
Royal Society Archives
.,Benjamin Martin was the man for the job. Martin had established a well-known trade of affordable instruments in London. As well as being a shrewd marketeer, strategically locating his shop close to the prestigious Royal Society, Martin was also a lecturer and lexicographer – the author of one of the early English dictionaries.,The brass compound microscope Martin sold Priestley was based on his ‘universal design’ of 1759, a cheaper version of one designed by the more-upmarket maker George Adam, instrument maker to the King. The microscope comes complete with its original red-lined wooden case and accessories, amounting to a whopping 33 items in total.,Priestley’s receipt tells us lots of useful information that would have otherwise been lost. It was made out by Gabriel Wright, an assistant who worked for Martin for eighteen years. We can also see that the microscope cost £5, 15s. 6d.,In the top left of the receipt is an illustration of Martin’s trademark spectacles, one of his most successful products, which became the name and symbol of his shop sign. Also on the receipt is Martin’s shop number, ‘No. 171’, a unique feature among the surviving shop bills. In 1766 Fleet Street was allocated building numbers.,It is a bit of a wonder that both the microscope and receipt have survived. In 1791, almost 25 years after Priestley purchased this microscope, a riot destroyed his lab in Birmingham where he was a minister and member of Lunar Society. The rioters were targeting religious Dissenters.,It is highly unlikely that this instrument would have been undamaged or stolen, so it seems Priestley must have lent or sold the instrument by then. It came to the Science Museum in 1954 from the
National Maritime Museum.
Alas we have yet to get to the bottom of its journey before then. The historic record is only so generous!"

The varied environments, weapons and game modes, and the ridiculous characters (Robofish, anyone?) gave it infinite playability. Plus, the long-lost art of split-screen multiplayer. I poured untold hours into that game, and I regret nothing. Also, the Dark Souls series are well known for being harsh, unforgiving games which punish mistakes that other games would let slide.

Great British Bake Off
and nineteenth-century chef
Alexis Soyer
? Well, I guess the blog title gives it away: food consumed – not literally – but as public spectacle.,Outside of the more intimate settings of our home kitchens, the return of Bake Off to our TV screens shows that there is a real appetite for what is frankly (light entertainment) food porn watched by millions. In Bake Off a series of amateur bakers are challenged by celebrity chefs and comedians to produce a series of baked goods armed with a range of modern kitchen equipment and techniques – the winner sometimes becoming a celebrity in their own right.,In the 1950s, the infamous
Kruschev-Nixon kitchen debate
at the American National Exhibition of American goods in Moscow was seen to epitomise the heady face-off between Soviet communism and American consumerism. Kitchen kit even became a hot 2015 election topic in Britain as the media dissected the meaning behind the gadgets, condiments and kitchen appliances of David and Samatha Cameron’s kitchen.,But cooking as spectacle and celebrity chefdom are not a new phenomenon.,Chef Alexis Benoît Soyer, a name unfamiliar to most today, was one of the most well known figures of mid 19
th
century Britain. A tall charismatic Frenchman with a distinctive jauntily-angled hat, he became first chef at the
London Reform Club
where he cooked between 1837 and 1850. He was also one of the first celebrity chefs.,The rich and famous flocked to see his Reform Club kitchen in the mid-nineteenth century. His initiatives to feed the impoverished London Huguenot silk weavers, the Irish Famine poor (whom he stepped up to cook for in their thousands in 1847 at the height of the famine), his cooking for Crimean soldiers and a string of kitchen gadget inventions and cookbooks ensured that his was a household name among contemporaries. Crosse and Blackwell even sold a range of food with Soyer’s name and picture on the bottles.,Soyer planned and oversaw the introduction of what was arguably the world’s most technologically-advanced kitchen at the Reform Club in 1842. The kitchen area was huge and certainly more dazzlingly cutting edge than the Bake Off kitchen.,It used gas-powered cooking which was in its infancy at most at the time and also had temperature controlled ovens, alongside a suite of ice-chilled drawer, slabs and cabinets and multiple kitchen prep and storage areas. Soyer even opened a restaurant up the road from the
Science Museum
in 1851 on the site of the present Royal Albert Hall, selling flamboyant dishes based on the contemporaneous 1851 Great Exhibition’s main exhibition themes.,Whilst the poorest homes sometimes had no kitchen at all, for wealthier Victorians the kitchen certainly wasn’t the place of public spectacle and chef-worship it sometimes seems to be today.,Most kitchens were hidden away at the back of the house, keeping cooking smells, hustle and bustle and kitchen staff away from the rest of the household. Victorian kitchens did however contain a variety of kitchen gadgets to rival any a 21
st
century show (or Bake Off) kitchen.,Victorian kitchen cupboards were crammed full of contemporary gadgets – bean slicers, canning equipment, whisks, dangerous looking mixers, a range of jelly moulds, cast iron cookware, spoons and ladles, sitting alongside ice-cream makers, cauldrons and kettles. Fast forward 100 years, and 1950s kitchen demonstrators used a mixture of brand new appliances (cookers and refrigerators) and sales charisma and to create fabulous dishes and sell appliances to an eager audience of mid 20th-century housewives (and it was mainly housewives).,,From pop-up toasters to horse-drawn vacuum cleaners, take a closer look at the development of household appliances in our

In 1957-8 the rocket was Britain’s main contribution to the International Geophysical Year, a global project to research the physics of the Earth.,Climbing to heights of many hundreds of kilometres, way beyond the reach of scientific balloons, Skylark could perform a range of experiments during its 10-minute flight time. Most of the results would be recorded on board and then parachuted back to Earth for recovery.,It is no exaggeration to say that Skylark laid the foundations for Britain’s space activities of today, which range from world-leading space science programmes to the design and building of satellites. It conducted the first X-ray surveys of the southern sky.,Early experiments measured the temperature, density and wind direction of the upper atmosphere by detonating grenades ejected from the rocket as it climbed into the sky. In the 1970s Skylark produced some of the earliest ultraviolet images of the cosmos.,It was the relative simplicity of Skylark which proved so important in training up young space scientists. They would have hands-on experience of designing and running experiments carried aboard each rocket. Many leading space scientists, from university professors to Space Shuttle astronauts, started their space careers with Skylark.,The experience could be memorable in many other ways. Most Skylarks were launched from the South Australian desert and conditions for the young teams there could be challenging. The heat was intense but when it (very occasionally) rained the desert bloomed only to generate plagues of locusts and budgerigars.,The name Skylark replaced the rather uninspiring CTV5 Series 3. A scientific officer working on the early programme felt the rocket needed a catchier name and so drew up a long-list of equally unlikely alternatives that ended with ‘Skylark’ – which was duly chosen.,Over almost half a century a total of 441 Skylark rockets were launched, making it one of the longest and most successful programmes of its kind in the world."

After documenting all the Museum’s waste for 30 days we have traced where it goes, and how it is recycled and transformed from rubbish back into valuable materials.,For recyclable rubbish put into the Museum’s recycling bins, the first port of call in the journey is the Grundon Material Recovery Facility (MRF) at Colnbrook near Heathrow. Here it is separated out into several different recycling streams. First magnets remove the ferrous metals (like steel cans) and non-ferrous metals (such as aluminum cans) then sophisticated infra-red technology identifies and separates the remaining rubbish into paper, card, glass and several different types of plastics. Any rubbish that cannot be recycled, or pieces too small to be captured, are taken to the Lakeside Energy from Waste plant for incineration, so no rubbish goes to landfill. At the end of the sorting process, the materials are baled as raw materials for resale to companies who take on the next stage of processing.,For each material, the recycling and recovery processes are necessarily very different, but it was interesting to find that there is always a loss of some material which cannot be recovered or usefully reused. For the plastics and the glass, that loss comes from paper labels and glues that are soaked off in the washing process, forming an unpleasant sticky mulch which gets sent to incineration. Even for the steel and aluminium cans which can be endlessly recycled, there is still some loss from the paints and pigments used in printing their branded logos and decoration.,As processes improve and new technology is developed, hopefully, one day these materials will either be captured for future use, or the waste will be designed out altogether. The model for keeping 100% of the materials in circulation is known as the
circular economy
. Sometimes only a small change is needed. In the exhibition, we have the plastic label and mixed flake that is retained from PET plastic recycling. By using plastic labels instead of paper the material can be more easily collected and recycled to make new products like plastic bags.,There is lots of information on the web about the processing of different materials. Some of the online resources I have found most helpful for this project are:,Glass

dhol
drummers, the aroma of incense and dance.,The launch of the
Illuminating India
season
marked the opening of two exhibitions –
5000 Years of Science and Innovation
; and
Photography 1857-2017
– which have drawn together extraordinary scientific objects and photographs from public and private collections in India and Britain, along with France and Israel.,Ian Blatchford, Director of the Science Museum Group, told the 600 guests:,“Many photographs and objects are being seen in these exhibitions for the very first time, and to allow as many people as possible to relish the cultural significance of this double bill both exhibitions will be free,”,The Times
hailed
Illuminating India: 5000 Years of Science and Innovation
as a “beautifully assembled show” which has at its heart the concept of jugaaad, which means the ‘art of creatively but parsimoniously solving problems for yourself.’,The oldest objects on display belong to the Science Museum Group, a set of weights and measures from the Indus Valley civilisation. The newest are artworks commissioned by the museum from the British Indian artist
Chila Kumari Burman
. “I originally asked Chila for one modest painting inspired by India but she was so inspired by the exhibition she presented us with 29 pieces of artwork and created a glittering tuk-tuk that welcomes visitors as they enter the museum.” said Blatchford (who added he dreams of driving it down Exhibition Road).,The most sensational object on show is a folio from the Bakhshali manuscript from the
Bodleian Libraries
, which contains the earliest written record in Indian mathematics of the concept of zero.,Recent radiocarbon dating by the University of Oxford instigated by mathematician and museum adviser Prof Marcus du Sautoy has proved that parts of the manuscript are more ancient than previously thought and that it contains
the world’s oldest recorded origin of the zero symbol
that we use today, underlining India’s pioneering development of profound mathematical concepts that include infinity and algorithms.,When Prof du Sautoy made TV series
The Story of Maths
he travelled to Gwalior in India to see a zero carved on a 9th century temple. Thanks to this ground-breaking research by the university, “we now know Marcus could have crossed the road from his office in Oxford and seen a 3rd Century one in the local library,” said Blatchford.,Illuminating India: Photography 1857 –2017
is an ambitious survey of the technological and cultural development of the medium in India, examining how photography charted the recent history of the country, from the beginnings of photography in India in the mid-19th century partition, independence and the present day.,As
Illuminating India
celebrates taking a fresh look at ancient ideas and familiar objects what better event to herald the beginning of a new visual identity and branding for the
Science Museum
. This follows the launch earlier this year of the new look at another museum in the
Science Museum Group
– the
National Science and Media Museum
in Bradford.,Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. Karen Bradley, sent a recorded message to the launch from the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester, to “convey my congratulations and those of the entire UK Government…It is especially fitting that tonight the Science Museum, which is the most visited museum in the UK by school groups, celebrates India’s contribution to science, technology and mathematics.”,The Secretary of State went on to thank the British High Commission and British Council, notably Baroness Prashar, Deputy Chairman; Alan Gemmell OBE, Director, British Council India; and highlighted key supporters, notably
the Bagri Foundation
,
the Helen Hamlyn Trust
and the John S Cohen Foundation.,She extended a warm welcome to the Indian High Commissioner, His Excellency Mr Yashvardhan Sinha, who told the guests that it was important that the people of his country and the UK connect and share, “not just what we did in the past but what we are going to do in the future.”,He praised the
Illuminating India
exhibitions and referenced India’s recent Moon and Mars missions, the Indian Space Agency’s recent record breaking
deployment of 104 satellites
by a dedicated group of scientists and highlighted the diversity of the team involved.,Chairman of the Board of Trustees Dame Mary Archer, thanked Shivprasad Khened, Director of the
Nehru Science Centre
, Mumbai, in coordinating negotiations; the help of fellow Trustee Lopa Patel; and the distinguished historians, cultural commentators and scientists, such as Sir Venki Ramakrishnan, President of the
Royal Society
, who sat on the
Illuminating India
project board.,Sir Venki, Alan Gemmell, Yashvardhan Sinha, Baroness Prasha and Dinesh K. Patnaik, India’s Deputy High Commissioner, joined Ian Blatchford and Dame Mary on stage to cut a ribbon to declare the exhibition open. “Our aspiration,’ she said, “is to develop a skills and knowledge exchange programme with Indian museums and to work far more closely with India’s industrial powerhouses from the Indian Space Research Organisation to Tata.”,Dame Mary added:,“It is our dearest hope that – with the support of people in this room tonight – we might see both these exhibitions heading to India once its six-month stay at this museum draws to a close.”,A series of public events, presented in partnership with the Bagri Foundation, will run alongside the Illuminating India season, including film screenings, workshops, panel discussions and live performances.,In his personal thanks, Ian Blatchford said he “would not have reached the finishing line” without Dinesh Patnaik, Deputy Indian High Commissioner. “On my many visits to India House, he and his team sustained my team with wise advice, gallons of tea and the best chocolate biscuits in London.” Ian finished his speech by thanking the Surveyor-General of India and his team:,“The Survey of India is one of the most venerable scientific bodies in the world, and 250 years old this year. Despite their own celebrations they have lent generously to us and so let’s wish them a very Happy Birthday!”,Members of the

Does it have an edge? With a stark and simple set, X&Y creates its own little ‘universe’ inside a brightly lit cube, making it perfect for unconventional ‘pop-up’ theatre spaces.  For its London run at the Science Museum earlier this month, it was performed in a converted empty exhibition gallery.,The Manchester Science Festival takes place in venues across Greater Manchester from 24 October – 3 November and X&Y is taking up residence for 5 days at
MOSI
’s stunning Grade 1 listed 1830 Warehouse at Liverpool Road Station.,,Liverpool Road Station was the Manchester terminus of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, the world’s first purpose-built passenger and goods railway. The original coach offices (passenger station), warehouse and intervening viaduct survive, making this the world’s oldest railway station. All four buildings and the two viaducts are listed in recognition of their historic and architectural importance. When British Rail closed the station in 1975, the two oldest buildings were in a very poor state of repair. Since then the whole site has been carefully restored.,The aptly named ‘1830 Warehouse’ was built in 1830 and it was the world’s first railway warehouse. Earlier railways, which mainly carried coal, did not need warehousing but the success of the Railway’s goods services created an immediate need for more storage.,,On 3 April 1830, the Liverpool & Manchester Railway Company placed a notice in the Manchester Guardian inviting tenders for the construction of five brick warehouses. This description is misleading as the resulting building was actually one warehouse divided into five bays. Five firms submitted tenders ranging in cost from £12,000 to £14,000 (approx. £1.16 million to £1.35 million today).,The second lowest bidder, David Bellhouse Jnr, gained the contract. He had taken over his father’s building and contracting business in about 1820. His father, David Bellhouse Snr., was also a leading local timber merchant. These family business connections were valuable because the appointed contractor was responsible for procuring the necessary building materials, other than bricks, which were supplied by the L&MR Company. The stated completion date was 15 August 1830, giving less than four months for construction. The schedule was tough, but Bellhouse managed it. The demanding schedule was doubtless one of the reasons why the 1830 Warehouse has a timber frame rather than a fireproof frame of brick and iron. A timber frame was faster to fabricate and assemble.,The 1830 Warehouse was used for the storage of a variety of goods. Cotton, one of the L&MR’s most important cargoes, was only stored there until two Cotton Stores were completed in 1831.,Two stock books found in the warehouse in 1991 reveal the type of goods stored there in 1885 and 1905. They list a wide range of goods including various meats, bananas, chemicals such as caustic soda and bleach, clog blocks and bottles. Oyster shells and cockleshells were found in the building, suggesting that it was also used for storing shellfish.,As the Manchester Science Festival takes over MOSI and other venues for 10 days, the 1830 Warehouse will be the home of Marcus du Sautoy and Victoria Gould and the creative team for X&Y.,Extracts from this blog from The Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester"

John Whittingdale
, noting the Group’s delight on discovering that the evening was his first official engagement. Later that night the minister tweeted:,The Director took the high profile audience on a whistle-stop tour of the year’s highlights including
the Queen’s first tweet
at the opening of the
Information Age
gallery; a celebration of two hundred years of London science with the Royal Society; our plans for the Clockmakers’ museum; and the announcement that
Zaha Hadid
will be the designer for our new Mathematics gallery.,That last project was made possible by the largest private donation in the Science Museum’s history from David and Claudia Harding. So it was no surprise that David Harding, a noted philanthropist and dedicated supporter of maths and science, was one of the two distinguished guests bidden to the stage by SMG Chairman, Dame Mary Archer, to accept Science Museum Fellowships. He and Nobel laureate Professor John O’Keefe were described by Dame Mary as “rare individuals who’ve given exceptional service to science and to SMG” as they were invited to receive their scrolls.,Dame Mary also told the audience how the Group is “equally ambitious for our very own Northern Powerhouse — our museums in
York

graphene
, first synthesised in 2004 at the University of Manchester.,To underline the significance of the two million children who visit SMG museums each year, Dame Mary emphasised how the country’s economy depends on the understanding and application of science, technology, engineering and mathematics yet, she added, “Britain is desperately short of engineers, only 20% of young people in the UK do any maths beyond GCSE, and more than 80% of postgraduate STEM students in our universities come from — and mostly go back to — countries outside the European Union.”,The MC of the event was the SMG Director of External Affairs Roger Highfield and other guests included the new Director of the National Portrait Gallery Nicholas Cullinan; film producer Michael Wilson; Trustees David Willetts, Lords Grade and Faulkner; Government Chief Scientist Sir Mark Walport; Director of the Science Media Centre Fiona Fox; Pestival Director Bridget Nicholls, photographers Jonathan Anderson and Edwin Low; Emmy and Bafta award winning director and producer Anthony Geffen; Naomi Weir of the Campaign for Science and Engineering; Wellcome Director of Strategy Clare Matterson and double Oscar-winner Paul Franklin.,Pete Dickinson is Head of Communication at the Science Museum."

National Media Museum
, Head of Photography Kate Bush looks at the history of the Science Museum Group’s photography collections.,157 years ago this month, the earliest incarnation of the
Royal Photographic Society
organised the first public photography exhibition ever to be held in Britain at the South Kensington Museum.,Borne of the sense of optimism generated by the
Great Exhibition
of 1851, the South Kensington Museum was an institution set up to promote the arts and science in Britain, later dividing up into the
Science Museum
and the
Victoria and Albert Museum
.,The exhibition was well received by public and critics alike, with The Observer saying that ‘The collection is… the best that has been hitherto exhibited… there are many works of a degree of merit which may not be surpassed.’,The venue chosen for the exhibition was a gallery situated above the museum’s Refreshment Rooms – the very first museum restaurant.,Today, less than a few hundred yards from that initial gallery sits the Science Museum’s Media Space, a bright and airy part of the museum building dedicated to exhibiting photography across two spaces and held together by its own ‘Refreshment Rooms’; the
Media Space café.,The gallery’s current exhibition,
Drawn by Light
, showcases the highlights of the
Royal Photographic Society Collection
from the dawn of photography to the present. The exhibition was recently reviewed by
The Observer
, and was similarly well-received to its 1858 predecessor, with the newspaper’s art critic calling the assembled photographs ‘a stupendous selection’ and a ‘magnificent exhibition’.,In February 1882, Captain William de Wiveleslie Abney, the South Kensington Museum’s Director of Science and President of the Royal Photographic Society on several occasions, had a letter published in the
British Journal of Photography
stating that ‘the Director of the South Kensington Museum is anxious to obtain a collection illustrating the history of photography’. This represented the beginnings of what became the Science Museum Group’s National Photography Collection – a collection of international significance containing some of the most important items in the history of the medium.,Throughout the 20th century, as the Collection continued to expand, the Museum continued to exhibit photography, with a major part of the RPS collection shown in the Science Museum at the end of the 1920s, in a gallery just below where Media Space stands today.,The Science Museum Group acquired the RPS collection in 2002 with the help of the
Art Fund
and
Heritage Lottery Fund
, which added to the collection’s existing highlights which include the largest collection of work by William Henry Fox Talbot, the inventor of modern photography, including the Latticed Window, the very first photographic negative. It also includes the largest public collection of portraits by Julia Margaret Cameron. Other exceptional holdings include the Nièpce heliographs, the Herschel Collection and the Ellis daguerreotypes, as well as key work by
Anna Atkins
,
Hill and Adamson
,
Lewis Carroll
, Roger Fenton, Oscar Gustave Rejlander,
Henry Peach Robinson
,
Peter Henry Emerson
,
Alfred Stieglitz
and
Fred Holland Day
.,All of the major movements of 19th-century photography are represented in the collection, which is situated in the fascinating National Media Museum archives in Bradford. The major focus of the collection’s 20th-century holdings is on British post-war documentary photography. The jewel in the crown here is the archive of

Martin Parr
,
Paul Graham
,
Chris Killip
,
Graham Smith
and Peter Mitchell.,The Science Museum Group would not necessarily be the first institution on people’s lips if they were asked to name a committed collector of photography, but the collection as it stands today grew out of the birth of the medium when exhibitors at the Great Exhibition were unsure whether to situate their photo displays in the Science section or the Arts section. They chose to give their display its own site as an ‘independent art’ and photography has retained something of this middle ground up to the present day. The Science Museum’s Optics Collection has many pre-photographic camera obscuras as well as an exhibit on the grinding of lenses. The Aeronautics Collection has an example of a microphotograph flown into Paris by pigeon when the city was under siege in 1870-71.,The collection also continues to expand, both in size and in reputation, as more and more work by a diverse range of contemporary photographers is acquired and a wide programme of touring and loans ensures that our rich archive is a resource which is shared as widely as possible.,‘Now, more than ever, photography plays a prominent role in contemporary life and part of the collection’s function is to provide opportunities for dialogue between genres, periods and other contexts for photography. Building and using a comprehensive collection of the medium’s various cultural histories produces a greater understanding of what is particular, special and important to photography in the visual arts, media, popular culture and the everyday.’ – Greg Hobson, Curator of Photographs, National Media Museum, Bradford.,Drawn by Light: The Royal Photographic Society Collection

a sample of penicillin
prepared by Alexander Fleming.,At 11.47pm on 25 July 1978,
Louise Brown
, the world’s first IVF baby was born at Oldham and District Hospital in Greater Manchester. She weighed 5lb 12oz.,Louise’s birth changed the face of reproductive medicine. Her parents had spent ten years trying to conceive before they were helped by the in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) technique developed by British scientist
Robert Edwards
and gynaecologist
Patrick Steptoe
. Since then over 5 million babies have been born thanks to IVF techniques.,Yet the story of IVF started long before Louise’s birth….,Scientists had long experimented with fertilising animal eggs outside the body, but few believed it would be possible to successfully create human embryos that way. Robert Edwards first achieved fertilisation with human eggs in 1968, but it took a further decade before Louise was born. During this time, Patrick Steptoe perfected a method for obtaining human eggs from the ovaries by keyhole surgery, using a laparoscope – a long, thin telescopic instrument.,It was inside this glass incubator that the embryos of the first test tube babies developed. Working together, Edwards and Steptoe, fertilised the eggs removed from the mother in a culture dish, which was kept inside the incubator at body temperature until they could be introduced into the womb a few days later.,Until now, the incubator has been in the care of the
Churchill Archives Centre
at Churchill College in Cambridge, home to historic documents of almost 600 important political, military and scientific figures from the Churchill era and after, including those of Frank Whittle and Rosalind Franklin. As a former fellow of Churchill College, Robert Edwards’ papers have been deposited at the Archives and the centre is now embarking on a two year Wellcome funded cataloguing project to fully list the contents of this significant collection which will be a remarkable resource for researchers.,The Churchill Archives hosted a small ceremony to make the transfer of the incubator to the Science Museum, where I was lucky enough to meet Jenny, the second of Robert Edwards’ daughters who’s been instrumental in making our display of the incubator possible. Jenny herself worked for a short time in her father’s lab.,It was really fascinating to hear Jenny talking about her father and to learn about the impact of his work on his family as much as on society. The tenacity Edwards’ had to show in the face of the controversy sparked by Louise’s birth and the ethics of assisted conception was really striking. Jenny also acknowledged the courage of Steptoe and Edwards’ early patients participating in such radical new treatment.,Plans for the incubator don’t stop at today’s display.,In autumn 2019 the incubator will be re-displayed in new
Medicine Galleries
opening at the Science Museum, which will showcase life-changing medical breakthroughs of the past and present.,We’re thrilled to announce that the arrival of the incubator coincides with an award of £7.8 million in funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund adding to a £10 million grant from the Wellcome Trust. This landmark £24 million project will transform the first floor of the Science Museum, creating a magnificent new home for the Museum’s world-renowned medical collections.,The significance of IVF’s contribution to medicine was finally acknowledged in 2010 when Robert Edwards was awarded the
Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine
(sadly, Patrick Steptoe had passed away and Nobel prizes are not awarded posthumously).,Edwards’ and Steptoe’s techniques continue to change lives.,IVF opened up new areas of science offering huge benefits but that continue to spark controversy – most recently IVF’s legacy can be seen with the birth of the world’s first baby born through a procedure using the DNA of three people to overcome mitochondrial disease.,We would like to thank the Edwards Family and the Churchill Archives Centre for making this loan possible."

Lates
, which was themed around the science of sex, drugs and music.,Being accustomed to working at music festivals, the rest of the Guerilla Science team and I are, shall we say, not unfamiliar with the hedonistic themes explored at this month’s Science Museum Lates.,For those of you who haven’t heard of us before, Guerilla Science is an organisation that specialises in taking science to summer festivals all across the UK – from
Glastonbury
and
Green Man
to the
Edinburgh Fringe
and the
Secret Garden Party
.,Working in unfamiliar and often unexpected settings, we set out to challenge audiences and scientists alike, getting them to consider and experience scientific ideas in new ways that are enlightening, inspiring and – we hope – entertaining too!,While not our usual habitat, bringing a sex, drugs and music themed programme of events to the raucous and exhilarating environment of the Science Museum Lates was an offer far too good for Guerilla Science to turn down.,So, what did we get up to on the night itself? Guerilla Science put on 14 workshops, demonstrations and talks across the museum, from mapping erogenous zones and anatomical life drawing in the fourth and fifth floor medical galleries to crocheting chromosomes among the strange and challenging materials gallery on the second floor.,It isn’t possible to go through them all in detail, but I’ll pick out a few of my personal highlights from the night to share with those that couldn’t make it – or can’t remember being there!,First up, Guerilla Science’s own Zoe Cormier filled the Museum’s theatre with tales from her new book
‘
Sex, Drugs and Rock n’ Roll’
, while chemist extraordinaire Andrea Sella treated audiences to a bubbling and explosive journey through the science of distillation.,On the third floor we ran a range of hands-on activities, from experimental hangover cures with food scientist Becki Clark to examining drugged-up fruitfly mutants with Dr James Hodge and sniffing a range of mystery fragrances with chemists Rose Gray and Alex Bour.,My personal favourite, though, was up among the aeroplanes of the Flight gallery, where sexologists Soazig Clifton and Clare Tanton discussed the findings of their national survey of sexual habits and attitudes and tested these against the audience’s own experiences and perceptions.,All in all, it was a thoroughly enjoyable evening and a fantastic opportunity to create something for the Museum’s wonderful audience. Most importantly, we hope the Lates punters enjoyed Guerilla Science’s attempt to bring a little bit of festival magic into the galleries of this grand old institution and might be tempted to check out one of our events in future.,Guerilla Science’s book ‘

It was created in 1969 by EMS (
Electronic Music Studios
), a company founded by Peter Zinovieff. The team at EMS used a combination of computer programming knowledge,
advanced engineering
and musical ambition to create a brand new instrument for all to use. The electronics were largely designed by David Cockrell and the machine’s distinctive visual appearance was the work of electronic composer Tristram Cary.,The VCS3 was notoriously difficult to program but, a year before the appearance of the
Minimoog
and
ARP2600
, it brought synthesis within the reach of the public. It sold for £330 and became very popular in a short space of time. By the mid ’70s, the VCS3 (and its little brother, the suitcase-bound model
AKS
) had become something of a classic and was used by many famous bands like Pink Floyd, Yes, The Who and
Roxy Music
.,This unique instrument allowed musicians to experiment with a range of new sounds never before available to them. Along with other early synthesisers it came to shape ‘the sound of the future’ in the ‘60s and ‘70s, and with further developments came the drum machines of the ‘80s setting the foundation for electronic dance music. Much of the music we take for granted today would not be possible without the pioneering work of groups like EMS and as long as there are developments in technology, there will always be people applying these innovations to music. Inventor
Steve Mann
has developed many interesting instruments such as the
hydraulophone
which uses pressurised water to make sounds, while artist and scientist
Ariel Garten
uses an
electroencephalophone
to turn brainwaves into music.,What sort of instrument do you think will make the sound of our future?,The VCS3 Synthesiser can be found in the
Oramics to Electronica

Oramics to Electronica
exhibition is the
TB-303
. Marketed in the 1980s as a ‘base accompaniment’ for solo musicians it failed to impress. As a consequence TB-303s soon became available on the second hand market, where they were picked up by inventive DJs creating a new type of sound know as House in cities such as Detroit and Chicago. By pushing the TB-303 to its limits they found a unique ‘liquid’ sound that became the signature sound of Acid House. Together with the TB-303, drum machines played a pivotal role in the development of House music. Today there are few music genres that don’t use electronically produced drum sounds.,In our sound (re)production stores at Blythe you can find two big wooden boxes. They are very early ‘rhythm accompaniment’ instruments. Much like the TB-303 they were intended to accompany solo musicians. But unlike the TB-303 both instruments are not purely electronic devices, they have mechanical parts as well.,The oldest of the two is a
Chamberlin Rhythmate
. It arrived on the market in the late 1940s, but was never very popular. It is a bit like a tape machine playing a pre-recorded drum rhythm on loop. Instead of one tape, there are fourteen. By moving the tape head from one tape to the other you can switch between rhythms. You can also speed up the tapes, or slow them down to change the tempo.,The other box is the aptly named
Wurlitzer Sideman
. This was built some ten years after the Rhythmate and doesn’t use pre-recorded material, but creates the sound electronically. Metal brushes attached to an arm sweep around a circular base, touching little contacts as they go along. When the brush and contact are connected, a current is sent to one of a number of sound-making circuits. The type of circuit that is activated decides the type of sound that is created. The speed at which the brush goes round defines the tempo.,It has been said that one of the founders of a well known company producing synthesisers and drum machines was inspired by the Sideman to start making his own drum machines. The company produced many popular instruments, but one of them initially didn’t do very well. It was called the TB-303."

Fourteen years ago the
BBC Radiophonic Workshop
, who created innovative music and techniques that made it one of the most significant influences on electronic music today, closed its doors for the last time. Maida Vale Studios, the home to the workshop, was a place once filled by people brimming with ideas that changed the course of Electronic Music.,The Workshop was set up to satisfy the growing demand in the late 1950s for “radiophonic” sounds from a group of producers and studio managers at the BBC, including
Daphne Oram
.,For some time there had been much interest in producing innovative music and sounds to go with the pioneering programming of the era. Much of The Radiophonic Workshop’s early work was in effects for radio, in particular experimental drama and “radiophonic poems”.,New sounds were created using recordings of everyday sounds such as voices, bells or even gravel as the raw materials for “radiophonic” manipulations. In these manipulations, audio tape could be played back at different speeds (altering a sound’s pitch), reversed, cut and joined, or processed using reverb or equalisation.,Perhaps the most significant recording in Radiophonic Workshop history came in 1963 when they were approached by composer Ron Grainer to record a theme tune for an upcoming BBC television series called
Doctor Who
. Presented with the task of “realising” Grainer’s score, complete with its descriptions of “sweeps”, “swoops”, “wind clouds” and “wind bubbles”, it has become one of television’s most recognisable themes.
Delia Derbyshire
created it by using a plucked string, 12 oscillators and a lot of tape manipulation.,The sound of the TARDIS materialising and dematerialising was made in an even less conventional way. It was created by running keys along the rusty bass strings of a broken piano, with the recording slowed down to make an even lower sound. It may not sound like it but look back at some old Who and see if you can hear those keys. Why not try it yourself – grab your house keys and take them to some rusty strings of a piano.,On display in

were kind enough to be our star judges.,We were overwhelmed by and very excited about the great amount of submissions we received. An incredible 156 tracks were posted on the competition page and our panel experts had a hard time creating a shortlist that could be sent to the star judges. In fact, they found it so difficult that they decided to double the number of tracks on the shortlist and 12 songs were chosen for the next round of judging.,And now… the moment we’ve all been waiting for. Who won the competition and who will receive that great collection of prizes?,It was a close call, but in the end there can be only one winner. And that winner is…
Telescopic Moon
by
Chris Weeks,DJ Spooky
said about this track: “Using nothing but the stems from Daphne Oram’s work, but taking them to places she would have enjoyed, this piece is a journey into some of the overtones […] Oram used with powerful effect.”,Because it was such a close call, we would also like to applaud our number two,
Atomic Shadow, with his track O3
, which Brian Eno called ”A really interesting piece – deep, entrancing. I wanted more of it.”,Our number three, with only 0.3 points difference was Obe:lus. DJ Spooky said of his track Satellite Oramix: ”Great use of the stems from the original material, and it’s a beautiful track that lets you hear how poly-valent Daphne Oram’s work is. Polyrhythm plus the beautiful use of the original material made this track a standout.” Brian Eno said:”I keep humming it.”,Finally a special mention for the tracks submitted by
The Audible Smile
and Astrogarage. The Wire said of Sattelites Cry by The Audible Smile: ”I like the idea of satellites crying to each other across the void of space.” According to Brian Eno the song has “the sort of mysteriousness that Daphne liked.”,Astrogarage’s Orbit was described by Brian Eno as “Very engaging, intricate, and complex in mood. I wanted this to go on and on.”,We would like to thank everybody for submitting their tracks and taking part in the competition.,The OraMIX competition was made possible by Soundcloud; Goldsmiths, University of London; Sound and Music; Boomkat; and the Daphne Oram Trust and the Daphne Oram Archive."

the
most important instruments for many of electronic music’s pioneers, and for the staff of the
BBC Radiophonic Workshop
in particular. With few electronic instruments existing, early sonic explorers were forced to adapt and abuse existing technologies, and practices such as
tape-splicing
soon became vital tools in the search for new sounds. Since then, the situation has changed dramatically for most musicians and electronic instruments and equipment have become ever more accessible and affordable. Or at least, this has been the situation in Western Europe. Many other areas of the globe have not always had such luxuries.,For dance music fans in the USSR of the early 1990s, records and decks were prohibitively expensive, if you could even find them. In Latvia several inventive
young DJs
turned to reel to reel tape players in order to make their own home-brew techno and house music. Modified tape-players were combined with Western dance and hip-hop songs recorded onto tape from the radio or smuggled records to create black-market dance music. The end results were some of the most inspiring examples of against-all-odds

BBC Radiophonic Workshop
, set up in 1958 to produce electronic sound effects and jingles for radio and television including, most famously, the theme music for Doctor Who.,We were also joined by Peter Zinovieff and Alan Sutcliffe of Electronic Music Studio, a music research establishment formed by Peter in the early 1960s. It famously produced the first commercial synthesizer in Britain, the VCS3.,It was great to see the union of what had been two relatively independent strands of electronic music history around one table, as they shared with us their memories and experiences of working at a time when electronic music was startlingly new.,It was the invention of tape that was the catalyst, enabling different sounds to be cut and stuck together to make a recorded track. Before this, individual sounds had been recorded onto discs or spools of steel wire which meant that it was impossible for them to be edited together in advance.,Dick Mills gave us an animated description of the rather frantic work of playing multiple discs at the same time to provide sound effects for live radio broadcasts. Each disc ran for only 2 minutes, so you had to keep two running for background noise, playing one while you re-started the other, while adding in other effects such as wind and birds as needed with cries of “don’t forget the owl!”,Peter Zinovieff, founder of EMS, had been taught how to splice tape by
Daphne Oram
. She had been a founder of the Radiophonic Workshop and creator of the Oramics Machine, which is the focus of the first phase of our exhibition.,Peter told us that the tiresome process of ‘cutting and sticking’ inspired him to experiment with computers to create sound without fiddling about with tape. His desire was for a computer to put the sounds together all by itself. This eventually resulted in the first concert performance by a computer in 1968.,Peter took up making music again several years ago and talked about a recent concert in Istanbul. He had meant to finish his speech by announcing this new standing as a composer. However nerves got the better of him and in an ironically comic twist he actually accidentally concluded by saying: “At last, I am now a computer!”,The development from ‘computer’ to ‘composer’ was noted by the group as a whole. Nowadays, they said, the computer has become almost ‘transparent’ – a tool to get something else done – while in the pioneering 1960s electronics itself was an art – something to be studied, developed, and experimented with. Musicians also had to be engineers, testing and stretching the initial primitive capacities of the limited equipment available.,Almost in summary, the words of the late
Delia Derbyshire
(who worked at the Radiophonic workshop and introduced Peter to Alan) were quoted. She had realised that while the musical products of her generation of electronic artists weren’t yet the best that the medium had to offer, they would prove crucially important for what was to come. This was what the future would sound like.,The Oramics to Electronica exhibition is already partially open. It will be fully opened on 10th October, and will run until December 2012."

A little later something niggled at the back of my mind – as though that elephant was trying to tell me something – but I thought no more of it and caught a train for Teddington and the NPL.,This, I’m ashamed to say, was my first visit to the Laboratory, also known as the
National Measurement Institute

one of the NPL’s anechoic chambers in action
.,The NPL studies all manner of sounds, those the human ear can readily detect but also those at too high a frequency for us to hear – ultrasonic – or too low – infrasonic. Other animals are different, though: elephants, for example, have been shown to communicate using really low frequencies.

Information Age
, will open in Autumn 2014. It will look at the development of our information networks, from the growth of the worldwide electric telegraph network in the 19th century, to the influence of mobile phones on our lives today.,One of the challenges of exhibiting the complex, and mostly intangible, world of information in a museum context is how you bring together the technology with the people involved and the information shared. The history of information is not just a neat history of devices. The telegraph instruments, radio and televisions, computers and mobile phones all reflect the material culture of information, but the history and future of information is much more complex.,One approach for dealing with this complexity is to look at how users, as well as innovators, have developed information and communications networks. Through personal stories we can connect visitors to the lived experience of technological change and reveal the significance of these networks to our ancestors’ lives.,As part of this approach we are conducting some new oral histories. We have recorded Gulf War veterans discussing their experience in 1991 of navigating around the desert both with, and without GPS. We have talked to the original engineers who set up Britain’s first commercial mobile phone networks for Vodafone and Cellnet in 1985. We will be talking to those who created and used the world’s first computer for commercial applications, the Lyons Electronic Office (LEO 1) in 1951. We have also interviewed some of the women who worked at the last last manual telephone exchange in Greater London, the Enfield Exchange in North London.,A lovely example of one account if this interview with Jean Singleton, a telephone operator who worked at a few different telephone exchanges, including Enfield when it was still a manual exchange. Jean left school at 15 when she started working for the GPO. Here she describes what made a good telephone operator.,We hope that detailed personal accounts like these will enthuse our audiences, reveal histories that are often not formally documented and show how centuries of ‘new’ information and communication devices have changed people’s lives."

Its mission was to explore Saturn and its moons and it has been transmitting data since it reached the ringed planet in June 2004.,When it launched in January 2005 Cassini also carried a separate probe, Huygens, designed by the European Space Agency. Huygens landed on Titan – Saturn’s and the Solar System’s largest moon. Before its battery died, it sent back images and data of Titan for more than ninety minutes.,Visitors can see a replica of Huygens on display at the Science Museum in the

It depicts Huygens descending through Titan’s atmosphere, with the second of its three parachutes deployed to steady its descent.,Since Cassini arrived at Saturn it has been using Titan’s gravity almost every month to manoeuvre itself into different orbits around the plant. This has allowed spacecraft to examine Saturn and its rings from different angles and closer than ever before.,Extended twice, Cassini’s Saturn tour has made key discoveries during its thirteen-year mission, including finding evidence of a global ocean with evidence of hydrothermal activity (possibly needed to support life) on the moon, Enceladus, as well as seas of liquid methane on Titan. It has also observed seasonal changes on both Saturn and Titan.,In the Exploring Space Gallery, visitors can see a prototype of the magnetic field sensor used on Cassini to monitor the magnetic fields of Saturn and its moons.The huge volume of data Cassini has produced will continue to yield scientific discoveries for decades to come.,In April 2017, Cassini began a series of daring dives between the gaps in Saturn’s rings, sending back never-before-seen close-up images of them and the planet. Cassini’s ‘Grand Finale’ comes to a dramatic end on 15 September when it will plunge into Saturn’s upper atmosphere, breaking apart and then burning up.,Scientists decided on this fiery end to protect Saturn’s moons from the risk of contamination by any Earth microbes that may be clinging to the spacecraft. This will keep the moons pristine for future exploration. Cassini will continue to transmit vital data back to Earth until the bitter end, using up the last of its onboard propellant to keep its antenna pointed at Earth.,And so, it is with a proud, yet heavy heart that we at the Science Museum salute the Cassini spacecraft one final time on Friday as it sacrifices itself in the name of science.

Seeing, or better yet holding and touching, the stuff that generations now dead made and worked with enlivens history, shucking us from the present and its endless clamour for our attention.,The
Hidden Structures
exhibition at the Science Museum trips us into the history of X-ray crystallography with a small but intriguing display of objects from the 1940s through to the 1970s. The exhibition commemorates the centenary of the development of the technique, by the father and son team of
William
and
Lawrence Bragg
who figured out how the scattering of X-rays by crystals could be analysed to reveal the atomic and molecular arrangements within, providing a vista of the structure of matter that had never been seen before.,The Braggs first applied the technique in 1913 to show how the patterns of X-rays diffracted onto photographic plates by table salt — sodium chloride — could be interpreted to reveal the organisation of the two atoms within its crystals. It was apparent from the beginning that the method was applicable to anything that could be induced to crystallise, even the most complex molecules of chemistry and biology. Soon structures composed of tens or hundreds or even thousands of atoms were emerging from UK labs, which established itself at the forefront of the technique thanks in no small part to the inspirational leadership of the younger Bragg.,,The first protein structures; left to right — myoglobin, perspex stack of electron density, haemoglobin,The artefacts in the
Hidden Structures
display come mainly from the first bloom of chemical and biological crystallography; there is
Dorothy Hodgkin’s
ball-and-stick model of
penicillin
,
John Kendrew’s
wormy brown representation of the oxygen-storage protein,
myoglobin
,
Max Perutz’s
black and white slabbed structure of
haemoglobin
, the oxygen-transporter from human blood, and in pride of place, Hodgkin’s huge model of the atomic structure of insulin.,These scientists had to be very hands-on at all stages of their work — growing crystals, carefully measuring X-ray diffraction patterns recorded on photographs, and printing out the electron density maps produced by their analysis. These three-dimensional maps (there is one for haemoglobin in the display, printed in sections on stacked sheets of perspex) show where the electrons are concentrated, so defining the positions of the atoms. The early models simply depict the contours of these maps and give the overall form of the protein molecule. Coming some years after X-rays had unveiled the elegant double-helix of DNA, their crude irregularity was at first a disappointment: “hideous and visceral” wrote Perutz.,But the resolving power of X-rays soon improved and those early crystallographers had to swap plastic and plasticene for intricate assemblies of rods, each representing a bond between two atoms, that were put together with loving attention to detail. Hodgkin’s insulin model from the early 1960s may not be beautiful, but it is mesmerising — and hugely informative.,,Hodgkin’s atomic structures: left, insulin; right, penicillin.,X-ray crystallography continues apace. Thousands of protein structures have been solved, providing a detailed understanding of the workings of biology at the molecular level. We see clearly now not just how hormones like insulin work, or how haemoglobin picks up and drops off its cargo of oxygen, but also how DNA is synthesised and decoded, how ion channels enable the transmission of nerve signals, how the immune system fights off infection. No pharmaceutical company works blind in the 21st Century; all use X-ray crystallography to reveal the molecular targets of therapy, whether from a virus or bacteria or a cancerous cell, as part of the quest for new drugs and vaccines.,But all the work of recording and analysing data and building models has now migrated to computers. For sure this has greatly accelerated the pace of research and discovery, but there are no more photographs or stacks of electron density or models made of stuff for future generations to pick up and wonder at.

The spectacular patterns revealed by the technique and the necessity of constructing large-scale molecular models has resulted in some of the
Science Museum
’s most striking objects.,By far the most famous result of X-ray crystallography is the structure of DNA, discovered by Maurice Wilkins, Rosalind Franklin, James D. Watson and Francis Crick in 1953. The context of this vital work is not usually talked about – the Science Museum’s display shows that proteins, viruses and other molecules were being intensively studied in the years after World War II. And the timing isn’t a coincidence: some scientists who considered the atomic bomb to be an abuse of physics turned to molecular biology, as a way of working with the fundamental physical structure but for a benign purpose.,But perhaps the most surprising thing about X-ray crystallography is that it has played an important part in the story of modern design. At the 1951 Festival of Britain – an even famed for its colourful and innovative look – one of the main visual motifs was atomic structure. We hope we’ve captured something of the spirit of 1951 in this display of important and intriguing models.,Brois Jardine is Curator of History of Science at the Science Museum. Hidden Structures, a new display case celebrating the centenary of X-ray crystallography, opens today until the end of 2013."

Medicine Galleries
, due to open in 2019, I have been fortunate to work on a wide variety of objects ranging from a 19th century post mortem set to a 21st century DNA analyser.,I love working on such an interesting collection and there is always some excitement when a new object is brought into the lab. I recently had the opportunity to work on one of Dr. Louis Auzoux’s anatomical models.,Dr. Auzoux was a French doctor, who in the 1820s developed a method of producing anatomical models made from papier-mâché that could be taken apart to instruct medical students about anatomy.,The object I worked on was a model of a male figure that was made in the workshops of Dr Auzoux between 1833 and 1866. It was a privilege to handle this object and remove some of the parts to discover the internal structure of the model. Not only was it a fascinating object but also one of my bigger conservation challenges.,I needed to document, clean, repair and stabilise the model so that it can be displayed and enjoyed by visitors in the new Medicine galleries.,There were numerous areas of flaking paint and loss to the paint layers, so my priority was to stabilise the flaking paint to prevent further loss. The model has a top layer of gelatine varnish, so I re-activated the gelatine using a heated spatula and adhered it back into position. A small amount of adhesive was used where this didn’t work.,Where I could remove some of the detachable muscles, I found areas where the papier-mâché layers had started to delaminate causing the muscles to deform. I used humidity to gently ease the layers back together, then adhesive and Japanese paper fills to stabilise the parts so that they could be safely re-attached to the model.,After discussion with the lead conservator and curator, I had the rare opportunity to carry out some restoration work on the model. There are veins running up the length of the model which show the flow of oxygen around the body. Unfortunately, the veins on the chest area had lost much of the blue paint, so their purpose was unclear. To restore these areas, I dyed Japanese tissue paper to match the original colour of the veins, then carefully overlaid and adhered thin strips of the tissue onto the raised veins.,After 35 hours of conservation treatment the model is now ready for display. Working on the model has been both enjoyable and beneficial in developing my conservation skills. I look forward to seeing the model on display and hope that visitors to the gallery will enjoy it for years to come."

Running workshops for primary and secondary school teachers over the course of a week was rewarding, tiring and most of all a great success for the team. Working with a variety of teachers from both international and local government schools gave the team an insight into the often surprising similarities and differences between Hong Kong and UK education.,Amongst all the hard work we did get to do some sightseeing and sample the delights of this busy, dazzling city. We tucked in to some amazing food, shopped for bargains on the markets, were surprised by hidden city temples and took many a selfie with that iconic Hong Kong skyline.,We even learned a few things on the way…here are some fascinating Hong Kong science facts you never knew:,The Bank of China Tower is a testament to the triangle.
The tower is formed from 4 prism shaped towers, which take advantage of the strength of a triangular structure. This means no load bearing structures are required inside the building and the rooms are as big as they can possibly be.,The Hong Kong Science Museum boasts the largest energy transfer machine in the world.
It is 22 meters high and occupies all four storeys of the museum.,Hong Kong citizen Charles K. Kao (also known as the Godfather of Broadband) pioneered the use of fibre optic cables for communication.
Ground breaking discoveries made by him paved the way for the communication systems we have today.,The Mong Kok district of Hong Kong is officially the most densely populated area of the world.
There are 130,000 people per square kilometre! This demonstrates just how important maximising space through clever engineering has been for Hong Kong.,Riding the Victoria Peak Tram will mess with your brain.

helping them to make sense of the science that shapes their lives.,Building Bridges
is doing this by focusing on three outcomes: helping students develop new ideas about why science is important to them/society at large; giving students the ability to communicate these and other ideas clearly; and an increased enthusiasm for science. So far, the project has been working with 16 schools, engaging up to 35 students at each school.,Each group takes part in three key activities over the year: an outreach visit into their school, a school visit to the Science Museum and a family event held at the Museum. The outreach visits were lots of fun for everyone: students got involved in the gloriously disgusting It Takes Guts show and took part in the “Science Communication” session. This gave them the opportunity to think about the stories behind the objects, and also learn science demos to present back to their friends.,In May, we welcomed students to the museum for a fun filled VIP day where schools were treated to their own exclusive events and a visit to
Launchpad
. They also met real scientists during a science journalism session, discussing subjects including the painkiller quality of chillies, and resuscitation. Finally, the students explored the
Making the Modern World
gallery, searching for objects to help a very important guest…,Last weekend, we said goodbye to our first year of students with a fun-filled family weekend at the Museum. The students brought their families to the museum and enjoyed an entire gallery of activities especially for them, including meeting with research scientists and the

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/do-brain-training-games-work/,Dr. Merina Su ,Do brain training games work?,Dr. Merina Su continues the conversation in the heated debate about whether brain training games actually work.,"At the Museum,Research","biology,computing,gaming,Power UP,technology,women in science","As a neuroscientist, I get asked this question a lot. Like, A LOT. Who doesn’t want to be smarter, faster at solving problems, more productive at work, or better at remembering names?,Imagine if you could do all the above simply by playing a few games online, or on an app, for a few minutes a day. That is the promise of brain training games. Games that could help prevent age-related memory decline, like dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. Games that could help you perform better at home, work, and school. Games that could increase your IQ and improve your mood.,The promise of brain training relies on the scientific concept of neuroplasticity, the fact that the brain changes throughout life, not simply by growing more neurons but actually changing the way these neurons work. For example,
London black cab drivers
have a bigger hippocampus, the part of the brain that stores memories of places, and
professional musicians
have larger auditory cortices, the part of the brain that processes sound.,The easiest way to understand neuroplasticity is by picturing the brain as a muscle. The more you exercise that muscle, the stronger that muscle becomes. If you want to run a marathon, you need to start jogging, and you need to build up your fitness with consistent practice. Similarly, you can view brain training as neurobics, a workout for your neurons. Neurobics has become extremely popular (and big business) in little more than a decade, yet science still has a very hard time with answering the question ‘Do these games work?’,Personally, I have tried some of the brain training games and apps out there, and I’ll admit, they’re fun and engaging. I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t secretly pleased to see my scores go up every time, hoping this reflects my brain’s health. Yet the scientist in me remains skeptical.,Yes, playing a game that asks you to recall as many words that start with the letters ‘BR’ as possible for 5 minutes every day will make you quicker at coming up with words that start with ‘BR’ and will probably expand your vocabulary with many more words that start with those letters. But will it make you better at writing that essay for school or  report for work? Will it prevent dementia and Alzheimer’s?,Well, probably not. In the same way that jogging for 10 minutes every day will not make you a better dancer or a football player. A point further determined by Professor Adrian Owen of The Brain and Mind Institute, Western University, Canada, who said: “As we showed in our
Nature study
in 2010 on 11,000 people who brain trained for a full six weeks, they got better at every single task they trained on. But amazingly, they didn’t get better at any other tasks at all, including some that appeared to be very similar to the trained tasks.” And it’s this lack of generalisability of brain training games to the real and complex world that causes scientists to
caution against neurobics
.,For me, it wasn’t the lack of evidence that stopped me from continuing neurobics – I play plenty of games that have no scientific foundation of benefit what so ever (Candy Crush, I’m looking at you). It was the fact that I’d rather spend those 10 minutes a day being out in the world, interacting with people, learning new skills and doing physical exercise – all complex tasks that I know for certain use a myriad of brain functions at the same time, therefore exercising my brain without any conscious effort.,Have you given brain training a try?

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/the-last-man-on-the-moon/,Will Stanley,The Last Man On The Moon,"Gene Cernan, the last man on the moon, visited the Museum for a tour of our space technologies collections and to see his old spacecraft with Curator Doug Millard. ","At the Museum,Collections and Objects","exploration,gene cernan,space","Update (January 2017):
We were very sad to hear of the death of Gene Cernan, who died at the age of 82. During his career as an astronaut, Cernan flew three space missions – Apollo 10, 17 and Gemini 9A.,The Gemini programme is sometimes swamped by the magnitude of what followed with Apollo. And yet the techniques for getting to the Moon were developed and tested on Gemini. Cernan flew with Tom Stafford – later to accompany him on Apollo 10 – on Gemini 9A in 1966.,Their spacecraft should have docked with an unmanned Agena rocket to practice such manoeuvring but the rocket’s fairing jammed forcing a revised mission schedule and also producing one of
the most memorable pictures
of the early space age.,Cernan went on to endure a gruelling two hour spacewalk on the mission. His modified suit proved immensely difficult to work in – restricting movement and painful on the body. His visor misted over and he could hardly see. There was deep concern that he might not be able to re-enter the Gemini spacecraft.,Cernan was the only astronaut to make two descents towards the Moon in an Apollo lunar module: the first time as a practise down to just 14 km above the lunar surface during the Apollo 10 mission, and then all the way down on Apollo 17 – the final lunar landing mission.,…,This is the Apollo 10 Command Module, sent to the Moon and back by NASA in May 1969 as a dry run for the mission that would put the first men on the Moon. But it’s also known by another name, “Charlie Brown”, and this was how Lunar Module Pilot Eugene A. “Gene” Cernan greeted the module when he saw it this morning (September 2013) in the
Science Museum
.,I asked Cernan what it felt like being reunited with Charlie Brown again, “You take yourself back in time to where you were. The view was out of this world.”,And Cernan should know. He’s been into space three times: as pilot of Gemini 9A (1966); lunar module pilot of Apollo 10 (1969); and as commander of Apollo 17 in December 1972, the last Apollo mission.,As only the 11
th
person to walk on the Moon – and the last to re-enter Apollo 17’s lunar module – Cernan has the distinction of being the last man on the Moon. How long he will keep this unique title is still a matter of debate.,As Cernan explains:,“Curiosity is the essence of human existence. We have centuries of exploration on this planet alone. What’s around the corner? What’s across the ocean? It is our destiny to explore.”,Walking through our
Exploring Space
gallery with Curator Doug Millard, our conversation turns to the differences between manned and robotic space exploration. “This is the only computer that can respond to the unexpected,” says Cernan, pointing to his brain.,“You send humans to deal with the unexpected. To bring back things no one expected to find. That’s the purpose of exploration.”,We arrive in front of Apollo 10. “That’s Charlie Brown. I like to feel that by going to the Moon in Apollo 10 for a dry run, we made Apollo 11 far more successful.”,Cernan turns to us and jokes, “Where were you when Apollo 10 launched? I know where I was! Sat in that.”,His re-entry was one of the most dramatic ever seen. Apollo 10 holds the record as the fastest manned vehicle, reaching speeds of almost 40,000 km per hour (11.08 km/s or 24,791 mph to be exact) during its return to Earth on 26 May 1969.,“It was 5 or 6 in the morning and we were like a shooting star coming in,” explains Cernan. “On my Gemini mission I could see reds and greens, but for the Apollo 10 re-entry I saw purples and a white hot glow.”,After Cernan spots
an image
of his excursions driving NASA’s Lunar Rover (Moon buggy) on display, I asked which was more fun, driving the rover or piloting “Snoopy”, the lunar module.,“Flying Snoopy was pretty exciting, but driving a car in 1/6
th
of Earth’s gravity. Well if you get the chance, try it. It is a lot of fun. I truly believe we could go back and drive it again, but you might need to replace the batteries,” he jokes.,“Someone did a hell of a good job building it,” says Cernan, looking at Apollo 10. “This not only got us there, it got us back again too. Every man who went to the moon came back.” The round trip to the moon took Apollo 10 eight days.,Cernan explains how he passed the time, “It was very busy, and pretty exciting. There were all kinds of experiments to do and we were getting ready for challenges ahead. On the way back, you look back and have to pinch yourself. The good news is you had the chance to do it, to go to the Moon. The bad news was that the time went so fast.,Our time is up. Gene Cernan takes a last look at Charlie Brown, his former home in space. “In Apollo 10, the three of us, Commander Thomas Stafford, Command Module Pilot John Young and me, we travelled faster than any other human beings ever.”,It’s a claim very few can make."

At present, the most common use for solar energy is through solar cells, which can be used to power appliances or heat water through the conversion of light to electricity.,But researchers at Eindhoven University of Technology have found another use for sunlight: generating chemical reactions.,Using sunlight to enable chemical reactions is tricky, as a high enough intensity of light is first needed. In fact, it’s a feat that has only been previously achieved in nature. Green plants convert light energy into chemical energy on a regular basis, in a process known as photosynthesis.,Drawing inspiration from nature, researchers created microreactors out of luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs), devices that can collect light over large areas and concentrate the energy onto a small target, in essence, mimicking the way natural leaves capture sunlight. Just like green plants absorb light using chlorophyll in their leaves, the microreactor uses coloured dye to capture sunlight.,In reference to the bio-inspiration behind the idea, the microreactors are designed to be leaf-shaped, complete with thin vein-like channels through which the chemicals can flow. These channels bring raw liquid chemicals to meet with the energy collected from sunlight, resulting in a chemical reaction whereby they are converted into the desired compound.,The technology behind these artificial leaves is so efficient that they would even be effective under the grey skies of London or in the misty Amazon: low light levels are no barrier. And because no electricity is required, they’d be suitable for use in remote areas where fuels are difficult to transport or obtain.,Although the microreactor is not yet ready for commercial use, in the future it could be used to make drugs such as antibiotics or anti-malarial medication in areas that lack access to medical supplies. Another possible future use could be to produce drugs or chemicals needed for food production on other planets.,The versatile nature of the microreactor is similar to how an oven operates, facilitating a chemical reaction between the ‘ingredients’ you choose, in order to produce the desired product. This means the potential applications for it truly are limitless."

And yet, even though this extraordinary global feat has continued unabated for decades, there are still some who doubt the existence of Father Christmas.,There are those who, like the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins, carp about the lack of sonic booms, as Santa flits at high speed from chimney to chimney to deliver all those presents.,Others have conducted crude calculations to suggest that, as result of Santa’s sleigh heating in just the same way as
Tim Peake’s spacecraft
did as it returned to Earth, our jolly fat friend would be incinerated during his high speed travels on Christmas Eve.,However, do stop to think about this existential issue for one moment. If you accept these doubts, then that is tantamount to accepting the existence of an extraordinary worldwide cover-up to maintain the fiction of Santa Claus, involving doting parents, news agencies, TV programmes and more.,We have discussed the rise of the ‘post-truth era’ in the Science Museum and what it means for science but, even so, this seems a global conspiracy theory too far: the idea that dads around the world are about to unpack a fake beard and red coat to delight their children is utterly preposterous.,Here is all the evidence that you need to challenge ten supposedly common-sense reasons cited for the non-existence of Santa:,The latest research suggests there are several ways to achieve this seasonal feat: Larry Silverberg at North Carolina State University has long
pondered such issues
and suggests that Santa Claus exploits features of the theory of
relativity
, such as that a clock in his moving sleigh will tick more slowly relative to clocks in homes he has to visit.,Some have speculated he may use a warp drive sleigh (it’s really not so far-fetched –
see this
Alcubierre warp drive, named after Miguel Alcubierre).,Or Santa may, with the help of exotic materials, create space-time short cuts called “wormholes”, as conceived by
Kip Thorne of Caltech
. The wormhole idea not only allows Santa to shift from chimney to chimney but to carry out temporal hops too, providing all the time in the world to deliver those presents.,Others have also suggested Santa resorts to quantum teleportation, like something out of Star Trek, though it is
trickier to do than many realise.,They are certainly an issue: to deliver all those presents, a back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that Santa must travel at an average of 1,279 miles per second, achieving speeds of around 6.395 times the speed of sound, or Mach 6,395.,Even so, there is plenty of research on how to reduce sonic booms,
see here from NASA
for example. Or perhaps Santa can remove them. He simply cancels the peaks and troughs in the shock wave with troughs and peaks of ‘anti-sound’ generated by a device. His sleigh generates a noise to accompany the sonic boom, such that a peak in the boom is matched by a trough in the emitted noise, and vice versa. The result is a silent night.,Although scientists are struggling to catch up with Santa’s advanced R&D research effort, they too have started to develop
simple invisibility cloaks
based on exotic materials known as metamaterials. Indeed, various invisibility schemes have been around
for more than a decade
.,Santa would simply take the digital instructions for manufacturing all the children’s individual gifts on-site, using nanomachines that grow them, atom by atom, from soot, snow and other chemicals collected along the way (not that far-fetched, given advances in 3D printing).,Large toys would require thousands of nanomachines working in concert—and would therefore drain Santa’s technological resources. That is why children should not expect more than one big gift each Christmas.,With Thomas Oléron Evans, Hannah Fry of University College London opens her book, The Indisputable Existence of Santa Claus, with not one but three mathematical proofs for the existence of Santa Claus.,Taking existing knowledge and building new truths using bricks of pure logic is what makes mathematics so powerful, she argues (so long as your great logical edifice rests on sturdy assumptions, of course.) ‘Deep down, we all know the truth, don’t we?’,With evidence that gene therapy now works, for instance to treat the blood clotting disorder haemophilia,  the power of
gene editing
, and the rise of stem cell science, it’s no surprise that Santa can use
cellular alchemy
to shrug off the effects of old age, and the incredible stress of a delivery schedule that makes the efforts of Amazon look antediluvian.,For a start, Rudoph’s nose, an important clue that there has been friction heating consistent with the demands of high-speed present delivery.,This would rule out competing scientific theories. For example, leaving aside the fact that Santa’s reindeer are probably female (by the time Christmas arrives, the only adult reindeer with antlers, and enough energy to drag around a sleigh full of presents, are likely to be female) some have suggested the redness is sunburn, owing to how the inspiration for Santa seems to be St. Nicholas, born around A.D. 270 in the town of Patara in what is now Turkey.,Another popular competing theory was outlined in the journal
Parasitology Today
by Odd Halvorsen of the University of Oslo who pointed out that Rudolph’s warm, humid respiratory system provides a cosy home to many parasites (our neighbours blame fly larvae, or ‘
snot bots
’). Hence, Rudolph’s celebrated discoloration is the result of parasitic infection.,We do know what he looks like, thanks to bones that have long been venerated as relics of St Nicholas, the original Santa.,Scientists have found that they
do in fact date from the right historical period.
Radiocarbon dating results pinpoint the relic’s age to the fourth century AD – the time that some historians suggest that St Nicholas died (around 343 AD).,The remains of have laid in the Basilica di San Nicola, Bari, Southern Puglia, since 1087, where they are buried in a crypt beneath a marble alter. They were exhumed in 1953 following restoration work and, half a century later,
Caroline Wilkinson of Manchester University, used X-rays and measurements
of the remains to model the saint’s head.,A trimmed, white beard was added after studies of Orthodox icons revealed that to be the contemporary fashion (though today it
could be causing an image problem for Santa
).,The resulting computer-generated image is a world away from the chubby, rosy-cheeked, blue-eyed jolly fellow, however. He was a short, tough-looking man aged around 60, with a masculine square face and a broken nose: you could see him being a bouncer at the Boxing Day sales.,There is a technique called Magnetoencephalography which uses a SQUID (a Superconducting Quantum Interference Device) to detect minute magnetic fields generated by the crackle of brain activity.,Sophisticated signal processing methods could then be used by Santa to filter the data and ascertain by this form of ‘mind reading’ who the children are, where they live, whether they’ve been nice or naughty
(though this is a matter of scholarly debate)
and what they want.,One sign that Santa is real is that his progress around the world is diligently followed each year by none other than the North American Aerospace Defense Command, which was set up to track Soviet ICBM missiles.,Today it deals with the monitoring of man-made objects in space, warnings of attack against North America by space vehicles, and that sort of thing. When Christmas Day approaches, you can use this

total solar eclipse
? The path of totality crossed very few landmasses, so observing this eclipse was for the most intrepid travellers. Next weekend marks the 150th anniversary of a solar eclipse which was somewhat less remote – but observed by some very intrepid travellers, who for the first time used
photography
to settle a scientific debate.,On 18 July 1860,
Warren De la Rue
and his team eagerly awaited the
eclipse
in their makeshift wooden observatory at Rivabellosa in northern Spain. The observatory and its contents – some two tons of apparatus – had been transported from Plymouth to Bilbao on board
HMS Himalaya
and then by stagecoach to Rivabellosa, where De la Rue persuaded a local farmer to set aside his
threshing floor
for the observatory.,The key piece of apparatus was the Kew Photoheliograph, designed by De la Rue a few years before. The first instrument specifically designed to photograph celestial objects, it was regularly used at
Kew Observatory
to record images of the Sun and Moon. The astronomers hoped that its
wet collodion plates
, with their short exposure times, could record the
prominences
visible during a solar eclipse. At the time it was not known whether these were part of the Sun, or an effect of the Earth’s atmosphere.,,Working in the hot Spanish summer, the astronomers only had a few minutes to develop each plate before the wet collodion dried. But they successfully recorded prominences on several plates – De la Rue described them with names including Cauliflower and Boomerang. When the photographs were compared with ones taken by
Fr Angelo Secchi
500km away at Desierto de las Palmas, the two sets were so similar that they proved prominences are intrinsic to the Sun.,For a lively account of the Rivabellosa expedition – including the tale of how the observatory almost burned down just minutes before the eclipse(!) – check out

These constellations, imagined to create pictures of animals, mythical figures, objects, etc. have fascinated people from all over the world for thousands of years.,Throughout history, constellations have had many different applications. Before calendars, they were used in agriculture to choose the best time for harvesting or sowing, as you could determine the time of year by how bright the constellations appeared. Ancient peoples knew for example that when Orion started to appear more visible winter would soon arrive, or they would see the Summer Triangle and know that Spring and Summer were coming as well. It allowed them to plan and form relatively advanced agricultural rotations.,Navigation benefited from constellations as well; sailors could calculate their latitude by finding the North Star (Polaris), which can be easily spotted once the Ursa Minor Constellation is found. This astrological lamppost always pointed them in the right direction as the North Star sits directly above the North Pole allowing them to find ‘true north’.,Nowadays, constellations are used by astronomers to highlight specific stars when sharing their research. Every star in a constellation is given a letter from the Greek alphabet depending on its brightness, with alpha being the brightest.,,Cultures throughout the ages have found different shapes in the night sky. In our exhibition
Illuminating India: 5000 Years of Science and Innovation
,
you can find some coins depicting constellations, dating back to time of the Mughal Emperor Jahangir (1569-1627). Having constellations on coins was quite unusual as this accolade was typically saved for Gods and Goddesses, Kings and Conquerors, and thus shows us the importance that astronomy had under Jahangir’s rule.,It was only in 1922 that astronomers in the International Astronomical Union (IAU) agreed on a universal set of 88 official constellations, up until that point depending on where you were in the world the names and boundaries would vary widely. The official 88 constellations depict 42 animals, 29 inanimate objects and 17 humans or mythological characters.,However various other unofficial patterns have existed alongside these, and are formally known as ‘asterisms’. This got us wondering about the difference in the night sky between the UK and India. The two countries sit at very different latitudes, with the UK in Northern Europe, and India bordering the equator, so we assumed that the constellations would look different, as the view you get is based on both the revolution of the Earth around the sun, and its rotation on its tilted axis, but we weren’t entirely sure how they would look.,It turns out they look pretty different…,It was fascinating comparing the two constellation maps and tracing the shapes in the stars, and it made us want to create our own, and so we came up with the Constellation Coasters workshop.,At the workshop, your stars will be colourful pins that you can push through either side of a coaster, before using string to create your own constellation by joining the pins up.,,Constellation Coasters is just one of many activities we’ve put together for visitors at the

Standard everyday materials such as wood, plastics and paints can also emit compounds harmful to museum objects. In order to avoid introducing a pollutant source ourselves, we take special care to select the materials we use in our collection storage and display areas.,However, there is another source of pollutants we encounter in museums: the objects themselves. The
Science Museum Group collection
has a vast array of fascinating complex objects. Unfortunately, many of these objects are made from a combination of materials which, despite looking beautiful, are not the best suited to be in proximity with one another.,Examples of these challenging combinations include elegant 18th century medical kits and scientific instruments, such as the syringe set above, that are stored in fabric lined wooden boxes. These kits usually contain metallic elements, which are likely to corrode due to sulphur gases. These gases are emitted by fabrics such as wool, a common choice for lining in these cases.,The fabric itself is vulnerable to acids, including those which can be emitted from certain types of acidic woods like oak, a commonly used material for storage boxes. Moreover, wood’s acidic emissions can also cause corrosion on the metallic elements.,Plastics and rubber are other examples of materials that emit pollutants which can harm other elements within the objects. Good examples of these are objects from our prosthetics collection. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from degrading rubber can accelerate the deterioration of leather or metal elements in the object.,In the Conservation and Collections Care team, one of our tasks is to mitigate the pollutants affecting our collection as much as possible, even when the objects themselves are the source.,Maintaining suitable environmental conditions is key. High relative humidity can make some materials more susceptible to absorb pollutants, whilst high temperature can accelerate chemical reactions and exacerbate the damage they cause. It is also important to limit the amount of external air that comes into areas with collections and the use of air filtration units in stores with large amounts of objects that produce harmful emissions.,This is just some of the work we do behind the scenes to ensure that we can continue to inspire our visitors with the objects in our collection. You will be able to see some of these remarkable objects in our new

Wounded: Conflict, Casualties and Care
exhibition marks the centenary of the First World War and the Battle of the Somme (1 July 1916). While the focus of
Wounded
is the First World War, the genesis of our exhibition lies with more recent conflicts.,A few years back, I was struck by the regular reports of British casualties in Afghanistan. While those killed were mourned and commemorated, at times the wounded seemed to be little more than numbers that were soon forgotten. It made me think – were they badly wounded, how had they been treated, where had they been taken, what had they been taken in, who was caring for them and what would happen to them in the longer term?,Looking back to the First World War, at the British on the Western Front, you can ask the same questions. But this was war on a vastly different scale, a new kind of war that produced levels of wounding unparalleled in severity and casualty numbers.,It was also a war fought within environments and under conditions which could be hugely detrimental to efforts to save those wounded. The colossal potential of which reached a peak for British forces on July 1st 1916 – the first day of the Battle of the Somme and the starting point of our exhibition.,What were some of the key medical challenges that arose from this carnage and what were some of the responses – be they scientific, technical or strategic – that emerged to cope with them? These are intriguing subjects for the Science Museum to address. Using material from our diverse First World War medical collections, alongside a number of significant loans, we will explore some of them through this exhibition.,However, this aspiration has presented its own challenges. The medical experience of 1914-1918 and the implications for the years that followed is a vast and complex narrative. Even by concentrating our exhibition on the Western Front and the British experience, we have had to pick out key strands and themes from what was a multi-faceted story. And it is not a simple case of the ‘triumph of medicine’. While real medical innovation did arise as new techniques and strategies were pioneered, others were rediscovered, or adapted and evolved through experience. Many mistakes were also made and time and again medical services were simply overwhelmed by both the nature and the sheer scale of casualties.,Two objects which epitomise some of these ambiguities are an extremely rare blood transfusion set, which we believe to be one of the earliest practical designs for use on British wounded, and an artificial arm. The blood transfusion set represented a major advance in medical treatment that arrived late in the war but proved the life-saving potential of what is now a standard procedure in emergency medicine.,Conversely, we are also displaying an artificial arm that was much coveted during the war for its apparent technological sophistication, but through the experiences of those who used it was ultimately found to be wanting. Initially imported from America, the Carne arm was an expensive item that became known as the ‘officer’s arm’ as only officers tended to get them.  In practice, wearers found them heavy and difficult to master, and many soon ended up in the backs of cupboards – never to be worn again.,A century on, the nature of warfare has been transformed. But along with the many differences there are some surprising echoes, parallels and similarities with the medical events of the First World War – both through the battles to save lives on the frontline and in the realities and potential futures of those living with their wounds today. Some of these contemporary aspects will also be touched on within

I was on a scouting mission for the Contemporary Science Team and didn’t know what to expect; certainly not that I’d become fascinated by quantum physics. In fact, I discovered a whole new world of extremely complicated but incredibly exciting technologies: early examples of quantum sensors, imaging, encryption, and computers. The quantum effects they harness could make these technologies much more precise, and powerful, than their current non-quantum counterparts.,To see if we could feature these projects in the museum, I had to delve into the theories behind quantum mechanics. Getting my head around concepts like ‘an atom can be in more than one place at once’ or ‘entangled with other atoms’ was tough. Translating them into simple terms was even tougher. These ideas are mind-blowing because they disrupt what we know about the everyday world we live in. Scientists have tested these weird phenomena in lab experiments but they’re still pretty mysterious.,Of all the technology that uses quantum phenomena I found computers especially interesting. Quantum computing is an emerging field. Fully developed quantum computers don’t exist yet, but the technology is progressing at an incredible rate. Concepts have been worked up into prototypes that are now being turned into real-world applications. Experts predict that this new computing revolution could happen in the next 25 years. Future quantum computers could do calculations in seconds that would take current supercomputers millions of years to complete. They could predict the weather more accurately and transform the way we develop new medicines, but they also pose a risk to cybersecurity.,Finding objects to represent cutting edge science is one of our main challenges. I have been looking for the right project to feature in a display about quantum computers since the showcase in 2015. Through my research I met the Ion Quantum Technology Group at the University of Sussex and visited their lab to see their prototype quantum computer. Brimming with machines, wires and lasers, the lab was amazing. The Group are building a prototype that will show how a quantum computer could be scaled up to tackle some of the world’s biggest problems. They had some great pieces of equipment we could potentially display—which is a key concern for us when we’re explaining science that’s so small it’s invisible.,The labels that accompany the
Quantum Computers
exhibit are subject to tight word counts. It’s nearly impossible to explain in any detail how a quantum computer works within those limits, so we’ve taken a different approach. You don’t need to understand how your smartphone works to appreciate their global impact. So we’ve addressed the basics of quantum physics in the exhibit but made the potential impact of quantum computers on our lives its central focus.,The Quantum Computers exhibit is on display in our Tomorrow’s World gallery until early summer."

The Man Who Knew Infinity.,With me was the Indian-born president of the Royal Society, the Nobel prize-winner (and self-proclaimed ‘failed mathematician’) Dr Venki Ramakrishnan, and Dr Eugenia Cheng, Scientist-in-Residence at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, author of Beyond Infinity: An expedition to the Outer Limits of Mathematics, shortlisted for the
Royal Society science book prize
.,Some psychologists would say that Ramanujan could harness a process in his brain that gave him deep insights into infinities and more without the use of analytical reasoning. Yet mathematical intuition probably works like intuition in everyday life, and also rests on some blend of experience and rapid pattern spotting that we can’t quite explain.,However, Ramanujan, who died in 1920 aged just 32, had an altogether stranger explanation for his wellspring of creativity. He gave credit to Namagiri, a local incarnation of Lakshmi, the Hindu goddess of good fortune.,Much has been made of how Ramanujan credited his profound insights to the Hindu goddess, said Eugenia. But, she added, ‘that was his way of expressing flashes of inspiration.’,‘We all use our intuition at the beginning of the mathematical process’ she explained. ‘It is very difficult to describe where that feeling comes from…the logic part only comes in afterwards.’,Mathematical intuition is harder to teach than constructing rigorous proofs, she added, and Ramanujan’s notebooks – examples of which can be seen in the museum’s exhibition
5000 years of Science and Innovation
– would provide a rich source of inspiration for other mathematicians,Ramanujan, born 22 December 1887, was raised in Southern India and, as a result of his remarkable mathematical skills, the then clerk at the Accountant-General’s office at the Madras Port Trust Office was invited to Trinity College, Cambridge.,There the eminent British mathematician Godfrey Harold (G. H.) Hardy and his collaborator John E. Littlewood, recognised the raw talent of Ramanujan’s work, which he had recorded in notebooks and tried to capture in a letter to Hardy.,Venki described how Hardy was intrigued by the letter from this obscure Indian clerk because he recognised some of the results but, importantly, spotted some that were not generally known.,His visceral insights enabled Ramanujan to excel in pure mathematics, notably number theory, a field that focuses on whole numbers, how to build them, how they behave and how they interact, explained Eugenia.,Maths research consists of intuition to “guess” results but of course you need logical proofs to convince others and, by helping to provide this rigour, Hardy complemented Ramanujan’s extraordinary insights.,Among his achievements in mathematics, Ramanujan built a bridge between number theory and analysis, another field in mathematics, which was extraordinary because the former mostly focuses on whole numbers and the latter on continuously-changing quantities.,In his second letter to Hardy, Ramanujan shared the following result, which looks either bonkers or poetic, depending how charitable you feel:,1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + … = -1/12,Ramanujan admitted that he didn’t dare put it in the first letter to Hardy because anyone – not least Hardy – would think him crazy to propose such an equation, said Eugenia. But it did make sense, she added, when making connections between number theory and analysis. Maths is not so much about getting the right answer, she said, but ‘about creating worlds in which different answers can be true.’,Ramanujan had extraordinary ways of understanding a series of the kind seen on the left side of the equation without the numbers all just being lumped together as an infinity. ‘I think this gives a sense in which he was the “man who knew infinity,’ she said.,This insight opened up ‘all sorts of possibilities,’ she said because building bridges between different fields of mathematics has much further reaching implications than solving individual problems, as alluded to in an earlier
IMAX discussion between Dr Hannah Fry and Sir Andrew Wiles
, who made global headlines in 1994 when he reported that he had cracked Fermat’s Last Theorem.,Venki discussed perhaps the most famous anecdote about Ramanujan, when Hardy took a taxi to visit him and had remarked that the number of his cab, 1,729, was uninteresting. Ramanujan had replied that, to the contrary, it was the smallest number expressible as a sum of two cubes in two distinct ways.,Today, it is often called the taxi-cab number (for example, in the Science Museum’s event on
maths and The Simpsons
) but Venki said that this was not a sign of Ramanujan’s intimate relationship with numbers, as is often claimed, but because he had already encountered the number in his work on Fermat’s Last Theorem – 1729 was a ‘near miss’.,Although, he doubted most people in Cambridge today would know about Ramanujan, Venki said that in India every schoolchild is familiar with the extraordinary story of how his mathematical prowess got him to England, where he was treated as an equal – even if, like most people, they would struggle to explain his mathematics.,Ramanujan has proved an inspiration to the next generation in India said Venki, and ‘that’s a lesson we could learn here.’,Eugenia agreed but said Ramanujan’s inspiration is double-edged: on the one hand it’s important for us to remember that mathematical ability can come from anywhere, and a great deal of it may be untapped because of the failings of the education system.,On the other, said Eugenia, it’s important to remember that to be good or even brilliant at maths it is not necessary to be like Ramanujan, referring to his divine explanations.,The evening event, a partnership with the Royal Society, was introduced by Matt Kimberley, lead curator of the 5000 years of Science and Innovation exhibition, part of the museum’s Illuminating India season sponsored by the

create a new work, stroke by stroke, before your very eyes.,,Now imagine this work is a portrait, providing an insight into the way Hockney composes his famous likenesses. Even better, the subject is none other than the distinguished Cambridge University cosmologist,
Stephen Hawking
.,For the next three weeks the Science Museum will display an animated version of Hockney’s portrait to provide its visitors with a rare opportunity to see how the artist’s skill has evolved since he was first introduced to the Apple gadget, the iPhone, in late 2008 and then the iPad.,The story of how Hockney came to draw new portrait of Hawking began last December, as we were putting the final touches to a museum exhibit to celebrate Stephen Hawking’s 70th birthday. We were going to show a rarely seen Hockney portrait, dating from 1978, owned by Hawking’s first wife, Jane. What about an iPad portrait too?,,Hockney and Hawking were excited by our idea. Arrangements were made to bring them together before the opening of David Hockney’s triumphant A Bigger Picture exhibition at the Royal Academy but they had to be put on hold as Stephen Hawking fell ill, also missing his birthday celebrations in Cambridge and the museum.,For his iPad art Hockney uses an app called ‘Brushes’, which removes the need to cart around supplies, easel and palette. This is faster than watercolour, or even than coloured pencils. He can use thumbs and fingers, or a stylus, modifying the hue and colour and layering brushstrokes of various widths and opacities.,From today the animated portrait will be on display to the public as part of the Science Museum’s Stephen Hawking: A 70th birthday celebration display.,The portrait begins at the top of Hawking’s head on a beige background. A simple sketch of Hawking’s bespectacled face peers out early on, adorned with violet eyes. Pencil-like strokes add detail, and paint-can sprays fill in his cobalt suit, a light blue cravat, computer screen and shadows. After a while, Hawking’s face gets its hue, polka-dots appear on his cravat and the broader contours of his wheelchair emerge. His hands are moved and a joystick, green background and overhead light installed before Hockney returns to work on his face. Again and again the artist plays with shading and skin tone before the final portrait of the world-famous cosmologist emerges.,Seeing the iPad portrait emerge next to the 1978 line-drawing offers an intriguing comparison — the technology is so different, but, whether paper or a digital drawing pad, it’s Hockney’s draughtsmanship and Hawking’s instantly recognizable face that are the focus.,,This animated tablet art is the latest in Hockney’s long flirtation with technology which has seen him work with multi-screens, high definition video, colour photocopiers, faxes and, of course, the iPad and iPhone too. One is left in no doubt that science has a profound impact on art and culture through its application in technology.,The movie joins other artefacts in the 70th birthday display, which also includes a specially recorded
message
for the Science Museum and a selection of photographs from Hawking’s life and career that haven’t been seen before. The celebration ends on April 9.,Photographs Copyright Judith Croasdell"

I was chuffed to be asked, but didn’t really know where to start.,After giving it some thought I reckoned it would be worth talking to some people that knew him and his theories really well, so I approached the Museum curators, Boris and
Ali
, who have been responsible for putting together a display about his life and work.,They were amazingly helpful, explaining a little about his theories about
Black Holes
and his work to unite the field of quantum physics with the cosmological. They showed me some images of his office, and his most prized objects and awards, along with some models he had made of the way light falls into a black hole. They also directed me to one or two objects in the Museum that have relevance to his work, one of them being
Geissler Tubes
.,Geissler tubes are beautiful! Alison and Boris described to me how a fella called
Geissler
was experimenting with vacuums, and created Geissler tubes by pumping gasses into the vacuum tube, and passing a current through the gas. The gasses glowed as they emitted photons, and though they started out as a curiosity, they led to two developments that relate to Hawking’s work. Firstly, the tubes led to the development of the equipment used to discover the electron – the first sub-atomic particle, which in turn, arguably led to the field of Quantum Physics. Secondly, the Geissler tubes led to the creation of Crookes radiometer, which as it’s name implies detect radiation, linking with Hawking’s identification of his very own form of radiation, that which escapes from a black hole.,I then hit upon the idea of making a “Black Hole Light” using the closest thing available to a Geissler tube – neon tubes. I liked the pun, and how it alludes to
Hawking Radiation
.,The form I chose for the lamp was inspired by the profile of the model I had seen in Hawking’s lab, demonstrating how light is sucked into a black hole.,I rather liked the idea of uniting the technology that led to the birth of Quantum Physics (in the form of a Geissler-inspired neon tube), with a form that is representative of the path light would take spiralling into a black hole. Mixing Cosmology with Quantum Physics, and trying to reconcile them in one artefact. Something of a metaphor for Hawking’s work.,Having made the light, I am really pleased with it. I really hope it can also serve a practical purpose in his home or office, and that he’ll like it!,"

event
was chaired by Fiona Fox, Director of the Science Media Centre, who challenged the panel on whether the ‘war on truth’ really is new.,,James Ball, Special Correspondent for BuzzFeed UK, author of Post-Truth: How Bullshit Conquered the World (Biteback Publishing), said that post-truth is, in reality, ‘a collection of old problems, weaponized by the internet.’,Science was forced to grapple with these problems long before the phrase ‘post truth’ was coined with issues such as climate change denial, and misinformation about autism and tobacco. However, he added, ‘that does not really mean we have got any better at tackling it.’,Evan Davis, BBC presenter, Newsnight anchor and author of Post-Truth: Why We Have Reached Peak Bullshit (Little Brown) said that the post-truth phenomenon was a ‘new and virulent form of an old disease’, pinning its rise on the election of President Trump in particular.,When it comes to scientists, however, Davis added that they are all too human; they make mistakes; there are replication issues and confirmation biases; and there are those ‘facts’ that turn out to be wrong or more complicated than thought.,His tactical advice to scientists is to ‘apply a bit of psychology’ and not to be hectoring, or rely on spin, but ‘more modest about what they know’, to express more doubt, respect and to be less dogmatic.,To persuade people of the truth, ‘shouting at them and telling them they are an idiot is not the way to do it.’,The decline of traditional institutions and the ‘rocket booster force’ of digital technology has created a new climate, said Matthew d’Ancona, columnist, Science Museum Group Trustee and author of Post-Truth: The New War on Truth and How to Fight Back (Ebury).,However, he acknowledged the problem dates back more than half a century, to the birth of a well-funded ‘systematic disinformation industry’ that worked on behalf of vested interests, such as the corporate-sponsored work on tobacco and lung disease.,The aim was not to refute science but to undermine the scientific consensus to sabotage public confidence, creating a ‘critical mass of doubt’ so as to preserve the status quo as long as possible.,He added that the disinformation industry is hard at work today to sow doubts about climate change but ‘what is new is the way we are consuming the mendacity.’,This has driven the rise of scientific denialism, ‘the growing conviction that scientists, in league with government and big pharma and shady forces are somehow at war with the best interests of humanity and our best interests.”,‘We have reached an astonishingly volatile point where evidence-based research is trusted less than anecdote,’ he said, joking that the definitive text on the post-truth era is the
Homeopathic A&E
sketch by British comedy duo Mitchell and Webb.,The answer for science, said d’Ancona, is to have more ‘charismatic leadership’, referring to the likes of Tim Peake, Brian Cox and Stephen Hawking.,He added that scientists also ‘need to communicate facts in a way that recognises emotional as well as rational imperatives.’,Truth, he said, ‘requires an emotional delivery system that is not snarled up by technical language, statistics and acronyms.’,James Ball pointed out that ‘there is good money in making fake news,’ but ‘we have got quite bad at telling stories from facts. There is very good evidence that arguing from evidence does not work.’,This echoed a point made in the introduction to the IMAX event by Ian Blatchford, Director of the Science Museum, who stressed the need to find the right way to engage with a broad audience: ‘It isn’t dumbing down, it is finding the narrative to discuss complex science with everyone.’"

Wait a minute. Doc, uh… Are you telling me that you built a time machine… out of a DeLorean?”,Doc: “Yes, the way I see it, if you’re gonna build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style?,Unless you’ve been trapped in an alternative time-stream you can’t have helped but notice that today (21 October) is
Back to the Future Day
. Yes, we have finally arrived at the date in the far-distant future to which Doc Brown and Marty McFly travel in the hit 1989 movie,
Back to the Future Part II
.,Doc and Marty might have been a little disappointed by the real 21 October 2015. We aren’t all zooming around in flying cars, lawyers have yet to be abolished and the police are even threatening to
arrest anyone found using a hoverboard
in public. And though Doc Brown invented his
time-travelling DeLorean
back in 1985, the prospect of real life time travel seems like a distant prospect.,Of course, in a way we are all time-travellers. I was born two months after Doc and Marty departed for 2015 and have been on a thirty year journey through time ever since, at a rate of exactly one year per year.,Admittedly just waiting for time to pass isn’t a very satisfactory mode of time travel, so can we do any better?,The laws of physics give a resounding yes, at least if we’re talking about time travel into the future.,In 1905,
Albert Einstein
overturned the familiar concepts of space and time with his special theory of relativity. According to relativity, time doesn’t tick by at the same rate for everyone; it depends on your relative speed.,An accurate clock taken on a round the world plane journey will show a slightly earlier time than one left on the ground. This effect was first measured by Joseph Hafele and Richard Keating in 1971, who took atomic clocks on two round the world trips by commercial airliner, measuring shifts of around 100 billionths of a second.,Though this time-warping effect is tiny at everyday speeds, it becomes larger the closer you get to the speed of light.,If Doc and Marty had used the DeLorean to go on a journey into space at 99.94% the speed of light for a year (according to their on-board clock) then when they returned, 30 years would have gone by on Earth and they’d have found themselves in 2015, all thanks to special relativity.,In fact, some real-life machines can do even better.,Protons whizz around
CERN’s
Large Hadron Collider
at 99.9999991% of the speed of light, often spending around 8 hours circling the 27km ring.,At these enormous speeds, an 8 hour shift worked by an engineer in the control centre pass in just under four seconds for the protons. The LHC is a time machine that sends protons into the future!,In fact, they could have made the 30 year journey from 1985 to 2015 in just one and a half days.,If the idea of whizzing around a particle accelerator makes you feel queasy, then there is another way to get back to the future.,This November is the 100
th
anniversary of the theory that Einstein regarded as the ‘most valuable’ of his life: the general theory of relativity.
General relativity
explains the force of gravity as due to the way matter and energy warp space and time and tells us that time passes more slowly in a gravitational field.,So if you want to travel into the future you’re going to need a strong gravitational field. Once again, general relativity can help us out.,One of the most exciting consequences of Einstein’s theory is the possibility of regions of space where matter is so dense, that nothing, not even light can escape – a
black hole
. If you approached the event horizon of a black hole – the point of no return – every tick of your watch would correspond to a longer and longer period of time in the external universe. So if Doc and Marty took the DeLorean into orbit around a black hole, they could travel into the future.,But once they got to the future, could they ever get home again? Here the science is less clear, but again general relativity provides scientists with the tools needed to tackle the problem of backward time travel.,Fittingly, it was science fiction that inspired the first scientific investigations of backward time travel. In the 1980s, the famous astronomer
Carl Sagan
asked his friend, the theoretical physicist Kip Thorne, to help him find a scientifically plausible way for the characters in a science fiction novel he was writing to travel instantaneously from the Earth to the centre of the galaxy.,After examining the equations he derived from general relativity, Thorne realised that it could be possible to create a tunnel between two distant points in space, or even in time; a wormhole. At least in theory, a wormhole could be used to travel from the present into the past, even if building one in practice might prove to be impossible.,Of course, backwards in time travel opens the possibilities of all sorts of nasty paradoxes, like when Marty accidentally prevents his father and mother from getting together, meaning that he would never have been born and therefore have been able to travel back in time in the first place.,Stephen Hawking
took the idea seriously enough to propose the ‘
chronology protection conjecture
’ – that the laws of physic somehow conspire to prevent backward time travel. Let’s hope he’s right, or as Doc Brown said, it could ‘unravel the very fabric of the space time continuum and destroy the entire universe’.

",At the Museum,"einstein,imax,space,stephen hawking,vip events","Roger Highfield, Director of External Affairs at the Science Museum, explores the physics of Hollywood blockbuster Interstellar. Book tickets here to see Interstellar in full 70mm IMAX quality.,Black holes
are thought to lie at the heart of most, possibly all, galaxies. So it should come as no surprise that a particularly striking black hole lurks at the heart of the galaxy of Hollywood stars—Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Michael Caine, Bill Irwin, Casey Affleck and John Lithgow— in the blockbuster
Interstellar
.,What is truly remarkable is that Christopher Nolan’s sci-fi epic spins around Gargantua, the most accurate black hole ever simulated, the fruits of a
remarkable collaboration
between a leading scientist,
Kip Thorne
, and a team led by Oscar winning visual effects wizard,
Paul Franklin
, who will help present the film with me in the Science Museum’s IMAX Theatre on Saturday (8 Nov 2014).,Interstellar’s plot, which started out being developed by Nolan’s brother Jonathan, relies on the monster black hole to explore the theme of time dilation, through which clocks can tick at different rates for different characters.,This is an idea that appeals deeply to Nolan. He used it in his mind-bending hit Inception, in which time moved at different speeds depending on the dream state of his characters. The extraordinary computer generated visions of Nolan’s dream worlds would win Franklin an Oscar.,Black holes are so dense that their gravitational pull prevents anything from ever escaping their grasp. At their heart is what physicists call a singularity, a point of effectively infinite density where the existing laws of physics break down (the laws of quantum gravity are thought to take hold in its core but we don’t understand them at all well). Around the black hole space-time itself bends to the point where even light can’t escape.,This extreme bending of space-time means that as you approach a black hole time will slow down noticeably for you relative to the outside world. An astronaut who managed to navigate into the closest orbit around a rapidly-spinning black hole – without falling in – could, in a subjectively short period, view an immensely long time span unfold.,Nolan was adamant that for Interstellar he wanted to explore ‘real possibilities’, not pure fantasy. Enter
Kip Thorne
, the 74-year-old Feynman Professor of Theoretical Physics Emeritus at Caltech, who was the inspiration for the character played in the movie by
Michael Caine
.,Thorne is one of the world’s leading experts on
general relativity
, the theory of gravity that Albert Einstein unveiled almost a century ago, and he once helped
Carl Sagan
with interstellar travel in his novel and movie
Contact
. Nolan brought Thorne together with Paul Franklin, along with his 30 strong team at the British visual effects company,
Double Negative
.,To make Gargantua scientifically plausible, Franklin asked Thorne to provide him with equations that would guide their visual effects software in precisely the way that Einstein’s physics models the real world.‘This is the first time that a movie’s black-hole visualisation started with Einstein’s general relativity equations,’ says Thorne.,Franklin and the Double Negative team, notably Eugénie Von Tunzelmann (CG Supervisor) and Oliver James (Chief Scientist), used a “render farm”, consisting of thousands of computers running in parallel, to trace light beams around the black hole. Some individual frames for the movie took up to 100 hours to create this way and, in all, the movie manipulated an eye-watering 800 terabytes of data.,The resulting Gargantua black hole looks like “a great lens in the sky with a dark heart,” says Franklin. And there is no way better to enjoy this, the most accurate depiction of a black hole created to date, than on one of the handful of 70 millimetre IMAX cinemas in the UK, notably at the Science Museum in London and the National Media Museum in Bradford.,Physics modelled by the film includes one of Einstein’s most famous predictions: that the path of a light beam can be warped by the gravity of a massive object, such as a star. When light from distant bodies passes through the gravitational field of much nearer massive objects, it bends by an effect known as
“gravitational lensing,”
providing extra magnification akin to a natural telescope and, as Thorne puts it, “image distortion akin to a fun-house warped mirror.”,This modelling of warped space around Gargantua creates a curious, compelling and surprising feature of the gravitational lensing of the star-studded sky along with the simulated accretion disc, the matter swirling into the hole at speeds approaching in the speed of light, which glows brightly.,‘This is the first time that a movie’s black-hole visualisation started with Einstein’s general relativity equations.’,At first they thought that there was a bug in their programming but when it persisted in the Double Negative simulations Thorne became convinced that the unexpectedly complex halo near Gargantua’s shadow was real and not an artefact. He expects at least two papers to emerge from the new details they found lurking in Einstein’s equations: one in the British journal
Classical and Quantum Gravity
for astrophysicists and one for the computer graphics community.,Thorne’s long term scientific collaborator and friend, Stephen Hawking, has argued that the long-term survival of our species depends on us developing
interstellar travel
. This is the central theme explored in Interstellar but, of course, to visit another star without spending thousands of years on the journey is not easy.,As one example of the distances involved, it takes light itself some 25,000 years to reach Earth from the gaping maw of the black hole that sits at the
heart of our own galaxy
, one with a mass of around three or four million times that of the Sun but 30 times smaller than Gargantua.,Physics forbids travel that is faster than the speed of light but might possibly allow for radical shortcuts:
wormholes
– hypothetical tunnels through space-time – predicted by Einstein’s general theory of relativity that can connect remote parts of the universe.,Their inception dates back decades to 1916 work by Ludwig Flamm at the University of Vienna, and later work in the 1930s by Einstein himself and Nathan Rosen in Princeton. Flamm, Einstein and Rosen discovered a solution of Einstein’s general relativity equations that describes a bridge between two places/times (regions of what scientists call space-time). This so called ‘Einstein-Rosen bridge’ – what we now call a
wormhole
– could pave the way to the possibility of moving colossal distances across the universe, even time travel.,It turned out that an Einstein-Rosen wormhole could not exist for long enough for light to cross from one part of the universe to the other. In effect, gravity slams this interstellar portal shut. This was a headache when the late astronomer Carl Sagan decided to write a science fiction novel,
Contact
, to travel from Earth to a point near the star Vega.,In 1985, when the book was in page proof form and Sagan’s attempt at interstellar travel relied on a black hole, he approached Thorne at Caltech, whom he had known since 1970. Indeed, Sagan had even set up Thorne on a blind date with Lynda Obst, who later became the producer of the film Contact (and of Interstellar). Thorne said a wormhole, not a black hole, was what was needed and enlisted the help of his students to work out what flavours of matter and energy would be needed to enable this feat of interstellar travel.,Thorne, Michael Morris and Ulvi Yurtsever speculated that with the help of fluctuations in quantum theory – one aspect of the bizarre theory that governs the subatomic world in terms of probabilities, not certainties – it might be possible to travel between different places and times.,In 1987, they reported that, for a
wormhole
to be held open, its throat would have to be threaded by some form of exotic matter, or some form of field that, because of quantum fluctuations, could exert negative pressure or negative energy and thus have antigravity associated with it. Thorne suggested that only an advanced civilization could make and maintain a traversable wormhole, “if it is even allowed by the laws of physics.”,At Hawking’s 60th birthday celebrations in Cambridge in 2002, Thorne told me that the laws of physics probably forbid ever collecting enough of exotic matter inside a human-sized wormhole to hold it open, but the final story was not in. There were still researchers studying whether it is possible to stuff enough exotic matter into the maw of a wormhole to maintain its gape – and there still are today.,So wormholes, while likely forbidden by physical laws, are still the subject of serious and respectable scientific study, and hence also of serious science fiction. Thorne has now written a book to accompany Nolan’s movie, The Science of Interstellar, in which he tackles wormholes, black holes and much more. With Interstellar we have another remarkable example, along with Contact and
Gravity
, of where the dreams and imagination of Hollywood thrive on real science.,"

full conversation
), as he joined Roger Highfield, Director of External Affairs, to discuss his career and  his new book, A Rough Ride to the Future (Allen Lane).,,Lovelock began by
talking
about his early visits to the Science Museum at the age of 6 and how his passion for science was inspired by his childhood love of steam engines, notably the one developed by the blacksmith Thomas Newcomen and the
Flying Scotsman
. He said that learning about science at the Science Museum was far more useful than learning in the classroom.,The conversation moved onto his early career at the National Institute for Medical Research in Mill Hill as he talked about his work on developing cures for burns during World War II, and how he preferred to carry out painful experiments on himself rather than rabbits.,He talked about how this work brought him into contact with Stephen Hawking’s father Frank, and the moment he
held the infant Hawking in his arms
.,Lovelock discussed his next career move to work in Houston for
NASA
, which provided the perfect opportunity for his inventive skills – creating instruments,‘exceedingly small, simple bits of hardware’ to go on NASA’s rockets. After three years, this paved his way to setting up his own laboratory back in the UK.,When asked whether he sees any scope for anyone succeeding as a lone scientist, he explained how much easier it was to work as an independent scientist years ago when there was less competition due to an overall lack of scientists in the UK at the time. He remains suspicious of committee and consensus led science.,Describing himself as ‘half a scientist, half an inventor’ he explained to the audience that invention is driven by necessity.,This process is ‘largely intuitive’, he said, and ‘the main advances in the world have not been driven by science, but by invention.’,The conversation moved from his work ‘re-animating’ frozen hamsters in a microwave to the importance of his electron capture detector, ECD, a remarkably sensitive instrument to detect trace amounts of chemicals, and gas chromatography equipment (featured in the exhibition). He talked about his home laboratory at Clovers Cottage where a lot of his experiments took place. The laboratory had a “Danger Radioactivity!” sign used to deter burglars.,The ECD helped hone his thinking about
Gaia
, a holistic view of the world, where all life on Earth interacts with the physical environment to form a complex system that can be thought of as a single super-organism.,Roger Highfield and Jim Lovelock then looked at the origins of his Gaia hypothesis, how his friend, novelist
William Golding
came up with the catchy title, his work on the theory with the American biologist
Lynn Margulis
, the opposition Gaia faced in the early days, notably from Richard Dawkins, and his
Daisyworld
computer model.,Later, when asked by an audience member to defend the theory against the opposing view by someone like
David Attenborough
, Lovelock replied that ‘To fight for Gaia is worth it’.,You can discover more about the Unlocking Lovelock exhibition in

The objects used in the display are foregrounded well, especially the beautifully-presented Hodgkin B12 model, and interestingly juxtaposed: the theatrical set-like pieces worked well to conjure up different historical moments such as Turing’s work in Cambridge and Manchester.

A,Homosexuality was a criminal offence at that time and in February 1952 Turing was arrested for having a sexual relationship with a man, then tried and convicted of “gross indecency”. To avoid prison, he had accepted the hormone treatment.,The most poignant item on display is a copy of the pathologist’s post-mortem report, detailing the circumstances of Turing death at his home on 7 June 1954, in Wilmslow, Cheshire.,The autopsy revealed that Turing’s stomach contained four ounces of fluid that smelt of bitter almonds: a solution of a cyanide salt.

and
Roger Highfield,There was a huge buzz of excitement in the Museum on Saturday afternoon when a crowd of visitors sang ‘happy birthday’ to the world’s best known scientist, Professor Stephen Hawking.,There’s no better way to sum up the spirit of the Science Museum than this very public display of affection as the eminent cosmologist visited our new exhibit to celebrate his 70th birthday.,That he is now 70 is remarkable: it was in 1963, then a bright 21-year-old PhD student at Cambridge, that Hawking was told that he had a type of motor neurone disease (today we know it as an atypical form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) and was given about two years to live.,His visit to the museum on Saturday was in itself news: last month, illness had forced the Cambridge University physicist to miss our VIP reception in honour of the opening of the celebratory exhibit, and he had to pull out of a series of birthday celebrations in Cambridge.,We found out on Friday afternoon that he was well enough for a visit the next day, and organised lunch in the Museum’s Smith Centre.,There he was presented with a
special gift
from the Science Museum’s inventor in residence,
Mark Champkins
. Entitled “black hole light”, it consists of illuminated spirals of light to symbolise a black hole and ‘Hawking radiation’, a reference to his famous prediction that black holes will give off radiation. Prof Hawking typed ‘magic’ in response.,Finally, to the delight of crowds of onlookers, Prof Hawking asked to be taken on a tour of the museum, which he describes as ‘one of my favourite places’ and he remained here until 5pm.,His tour included the Apollo 10 capsule in
Making the Modern World
(Professor Hawking is a keen advocate of human spaceflight) and the Cosmos & Culture gallery where he admired the works of illustrious predecessors such as Copernicus, Galileo, Newton and Einstein. He also checked out our latest exhibits including the Fenix rescue capsule and
Oramics to Electronica
, and enjoyed seeing younger visitors in our hands-on Launch Pad gallery – we would like to think that there’s a future Stephen Hawking among them.,When Prof Hawking left, he told us: “The museum is much better than when I used to come in the 40s and 50s”.,The exhibit in his honour represents the first ever display of items from the Hawking archive and encourages visitors to reflect on the relationship between Hawking’s scientific achievements, particularly the work that established his reputation in the 1960s and ‘70s, and his immense success in popularising astrophysics. Hawking and his daughter Lucy have been involved in the selection of objects for display."

Automatic Neuroscientist
,  based on Bayesian Optimisation – was developed at Imperial by Romy Lorenz and Rob Leech.,In collaboration with Ines Violante and Adam Hampshire, the Automatic Neuroscientist studied the patterns of activation in the brains of 31 people as they explored 16 cognitive tests.,The machine was then asked to first identify the tasks that produced the biggest differences between the use of networks in the brain that are involved in almost any difficult task that requires us to concentrate and solve problems.,The automatic neuroscientist first identified what their contributions are, and then redesigned the tasks that produced the biggest differences in these circuits to see if they could disentangle the contribution of different brain networks as strongly as possible, providing precision measures of their functions.,Critically, the AI picked tasks based on the difference in activation of two brain networks,  namely, deductive reasoning and spatial planning.,This chimed with findings of an earlier online study –
published in the journal
Neuron
by a team including myself and one of the coauthors of the new Imperial study
– which concluded that three different networks in the brain support different processes that underlie intelligence, therefore it could not be boiled down to a single master brain network, or a single number like IQ.,The fact that the new study highlighted two of the tasks from the earlier study was ‘pure blind luck,’ said Adam Hampshire, co-author of both studies.,A meta-analysis of many previous studies suggested that some of the 16 tasks that were examined should have activated different circuits; the AI did a better job than the meta-analysis, presumably because it was free of bias.,‘Reproducibility in the DNA of this method, which keeps on checking, updating and revalidating its hypothesis,’ said Hampshire. ‘It is a revolutionary approach to brain imaging.’,Therefore, as well as independently confirming two of the three circuits identified by the 2012 paper, the study shows that the ‘gold standard’, reviews of earlier brain scan studies or meta-analyses, are not as powerful as thought.,A final analysis in the
study reported today showed that each mental task draws on a unique combination of networks in the brain, as shown in this diagram, which accords with an idea first put forward by L. L. Thurstone – the multiple-factor theory – back in 1938.,Today’s study has bigger implications. AI could offer a way to overcome what scientists call the ‘replication crisis’, which was first highlighted in 2005,  when Stanford University professor John Ioannidis concluded that most of the results of
most publications in science could not be reproduced independently
.,A decade later, it was reported that more than half of psychology studies could not be reproduced. Last year, Ioannidis published a study which concluded that cognitive neuroscience was in an even worse state.,Leech believes AI can help reduce subjectivity from research, ranging from exploration, where hypotheses are poorly defined, to exploitation, where well-established hypotheses are refined.  Of course, you still need people to devise prior hypotheses, write code, make assumptions, define the freedom to experiment, write up research papers and so on.,But AI is faster than people, and more reliable. ‘The Automatic Neuroscientist could blaze a trail for the automatic radiologist, the automatic psychologist and more,’ said Leech.,The Imperial College London team has also created Cognitron,
the first artificial intelligence designed to survey human mental skills
. Cognitron is extending the Nature Communications research by developing a new set of tests that measures different aspects of intelligence as precisely and accurately as possible.,Visit Cognitron and, after you have supplied a few personal details, it will design a series of brain-twisting tests lasting about 30 minutes to an hour and tell you how well you did.

HEARTS,,Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School joined forces to create pluripotent stem cells (cells that can become several types of cells) which they used to form tissue resembling that of a developing human heart. When given an electric shock, the tissue began to beat!,3. SKIN,Doctors in the US have designed a way to treat people with severe burns by using a thin layer of stem cells taken from the patient. These stem cells are sprayed onto the wound, allowing the skin to heal evenly and completely without the need for painful, infection-prone skin grafts.,4. BONES,,Scientists at the University of Glasgow and the University of the West of Scotland have created a ‘putty’ for use as a graft for broken bones. Stem cells extracted from bone marrow cells are suspended in a collagen gel and exposed to nanovibrations. Although the resulting mix is softer than human bone, it helps big breaks heal quicker and stronger.,5. MUSCLES,,Researchers at Duke University have grown bundles of muscle fibres that twitch and respond to electrical stimuli. The muscle cells were grown from pluripotent stem cells or cells taken from a biopsy. This lab-grown muscle could be used to develop new drugs for muscle conditions and test the efficiency of treatments before using them on patients.,6. BRAINS,To study genetic mutations in the brain, scientists from the University of California are taking stem cells from children’s milk teeth and reprogramming them into neurons (the cells that transmit nerve impulses). These organoids resemble brains in the early embryonic stage.,7. LIVER,Liver buds have been grown from human stem cells by scientists from Yokohama City University.

Nature
by American Jim Watson and Briton Francis Crick.,Jim Watson visited the Science Museum to mark the anniversary, see his original molecular models now held by the museum, and discuss the shock-waves that are still being sent out by his momentous 1953 discovery, from gene editing to developing new cancer treatments.,,For many scientists, the discovery of the structure of DNA by this Cambridge-based team was only the beginning. It paved the way for new research in areas such as gene therapy for inherited diseases, the sequencing of the human genetic sequence – genome – and biotechnology.,‘That the essence of DNA came in less than one and a half years after I came to Cambridge’s Cavendish Laboratory, in the early fall of 1951, was more than wonderful,’ recalled Watson in a recent speech. ‘Within a day of our first meeting, I saw the then 35-year-old Francis Crick as extraordinary, not only through his brains but in his basic kindness, warmly treating me like a younger brother that had to be looked after.’,Earlier studies had shown that DNA is composed of building blocks called nucleotides consisting of a deoxyribose sugar, a phosphate group, and four nitrogen bases — adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C). Phosphates and sugars of adjacent nucleotides link to form a long polymer.,One Saturday morning in February 1953, the race to determine how these pieces fit together in a three-dimensional model of the double helix was won by Watson and Crick.,Later that day, at the nearby Eagle pub, Crick supposedly declared that they had discovered the secret of life. Their discovery marked a milestone and set about revolutions in medicine, society, the environment and information processing.,Watson’s racy personal account of the discovery,
The Double Helix
(1968), became a bestseller and caused sensation for its candor. It is listed by the Library of Congress as one of 100 ‘Books That Shaped America’ and has now been published as ‘The Annotated and Illustrated Double Helix.’,In the book, which celebrates its 50th birthday this year, Watson described the cast of characters in the race to the helix, notably Maurice Wilkins (with whom they would share the Nobel prize) along with Lawrence Bragg, Jerry Donohue, Rosalind Franklin, and their rival in America, Linus Pauling.,It was Wilkins’ pioneering X-ray studies of DNA which had first excited Watson. Wilkins and another key figure in the story, Rosalind Franklin, worked at King’s College, London. Franklin’s PhD student Raymond Gosling took Franklin’s X-ray photographs of DNA. Numbered 51 and taken in May 1952, it revealed a black cross of reflections, and would prove the key to unlocking the molecular structure of DNA, revealing it to be a double helix.,On leaving King’s College, Franklin gave all her data to Wilkins who then showed photograph 51 to Watson. Watson recalled the image was a revelation, because it ‘was so perfect’ and provided insights into the relationship between the bases (the chemical ‘letters’ of the genetic code, which form a ladder like structure inside) and the supporting structure of phosphate groups.,The molecular structures for the bases they used in their models of this structure were corrected one Thursday by quantum chemist Jerry Donohue, who shared an office with Watson and Crick. That insight proved essential, Watson told me, for his recognition of ‘base-pairing’ and for building one turn of the double helix the following Saturday on a table in the middle of their office.,The helical DNA structure came as an epiphany, ‘far more beautiful than we ever anticipated,’ said Watson, because the complementary nature of the letters of DNA (the letter A always pairs with T, and C with G) instantly revealed how genes were copied when cells divide: this was the long-sought mechanism of inheritance.,In 1962, four years after Franklin’s death due to cancer at age 37, Watson, Crick and Wilkins shared a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.,Between 1988 and 1992, Watson helped establish and served as first director of the US National Institute of Health’s Human Genome Project, to read every ‘letter’ in the human genetic code. In 2007, Watson and his rival in the race to sequence the human genome, Craig Venter, became the first to have their entire genetic code sequenced this way.,Watson celebrated his 90th birthday earlier this month with a gala piano concert and dinner at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on the East Coast of America, which Watson’s leadership turned into one of the world’s principal centres of biology, focusing on cancer genetics.,Eight Nobel laureates and many other giants in the worlds of biotech, genetics and scientific publishing were among the 400 guests gathered to toast his contributions to science and society.,He told them: ‘Key molecular biologists will soon be viewed by history as important as those great physicists of the 20th century who gave the world relativity, quantum mechanics, and nuclear energy.  The Molecular Biology that has followed the 1953 finding of the Double Helix has been more than extraordinary.  Even today we still move fast and furious in seeking out fundamental biological truths.’,He also gave a pledge that ‘I can and will remain active in fighting cancer as long as my brain remains functional.’,‘Further greatness in cancer research will likely only come through the development of drugs that give lifetime cures for the vast majority of its victims,’ he said.  ‘Much reassuring me are two largely still untested classes of anti-cancer agents that block key features of malignant cells.’,One class of drugs on entering ‘cells generate cancer cell killing amounts of reactive oxygen species like superoxide and hydrogen peroxide.’ The second consists of ‘selective small micro (µ) RNAs’, which block key aspects of cancer cell metabolism:  ‘these have the potential of killing much, if not virtually all, of today’s chemo-resistant cancer cell killers.’,Watson also mentioned his two top moral heroes, Bernie Sanders and Pope Francis, alluding to his recent interest in the genetics of human nature, notably the extraordinary extent to which humans cooperate. He told me: ‘”Evolution of ethical behaviour,” you know it is not a bad title for a book.’,This year Jim and his wife Liz celebrated their 50th year at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, on the North Shore of Long Island, along with their 50th wedding anniversary."

No songs were issued as singles, and yet it sold 2.5 million copies in three months and was regarded as one of the most popular and influential records of the decade.,In many ways,
Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band
is a surprising album: it explored new sounds and ways of recording music, developed the idea of the concept-album and was a cornerstone for British psychedelia.,Thanks to the band’s White Album sales, their record company EMI was able to fund scientific research. Part of this funding went to Sir Godfrey Hounsfield, who was researching X-rays and eventually invented the CT scanner.,The
CT scanner
makes it easier for radiologists to view the soft tissues in the body, enabling them to create detailed images and detect any abnormalities.,Astronomers tend to be pretty creative about naming newly discovered asteroids. No surprise then that there are not one but five space-rocks named after the Liverpudlian icons: Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, Starr and Beatles.,In 2005, astronauts on board of the
International Space Station
were awakened by a very special guest. In a special live relay, Sir Paul McCartney played ‘Good Day Sunshine’ for the intrepid astronauts orbiting Earth. We can’t imagine a catchier tune to be woken up by…,Just before recording Sgt. Pepper’s, The Beatles decided to stop playing live shows: Beatles concerts had become, in the words of Lennon, ‘tribal rites’ and as the Live At The Hollywood Bowl album demonstrates, sound quality was heavily affected by the sheer number of screaming fans.,But in 2016, James Clarke, a system analyst at Abbey Road Studio, devised a de-mixing software using a programming tool called
MATLAB
. It works by taking a track and separating it into each of its constituent parts – bass, guitar, kick drum, vocals and remixing them, enabling the restoration of the only Beatles live record in existence.,In 1983 one of the best-known textbooks in molecular biology, Molecular Biology of the Cell, was published.,When its third edition was printed in 1994, its authors decided to put their own tribute to The Beatles’ Abbey Road album cover on the back of the book, taking a picture of them walking across the iconic street. This started a twenty-year-long tradition of Beatles covers homages, currently sitting in many university libraries worldwide.,On the following book update in 2002, they went full out with the Beatlesmania, going as far as to recreate the

","At the Museum,Collections and Objects,Exhibitions and Galleries","chemistry,war,wounded","On 27 May, exactly 100 years ago, it was National Egg Day. Now we are used to the regular occurrence of such obscure, trivial celebrations on Twitter (I honoured National Limerick Day in my
last blog
). But this was an era long before social media. So why raise a toast to eggs on 27 May 1918?,The Times
advert for National Egg Day implored its readers to ‘send eggs’ to the wounded. ‘In cases of gas
poisoning
in especial the men
must have eggs
. Can you deny them?’,The promotion of ‘eggs for the soldiers’, as one slogan ran, began in 1914 with the
National Egg Collection
campaign, following a proposal from editor of the magazine
Poultry World
(still in print!)
.
Over 41 million eggs had been collected by the end of the campaign in 1919.,But it is unclear why the War Office considered eggs especially essential for victims of poison gas.,Poison gas became the greatest fear among soldiers fighting in the Great War. On 22 April 1915 the German Army deployed 168 tons of liquid chlorine at the battle of Ypres, the resulting yellow gas cloud asphyxiating thousands of soldiers within minutes. It was the first instance of mass killing by a chemical agent.,Gas masks were quickly developed in response. The earliest kind, issued to the British within 36 hours of the Ypres attack, was simply a
gauge veil
containing cotton soaked in a solution of sodium thiosulphate, washing soda and glycerine, which protected against low concentrations of chlorine.,In January 1916 the ‘PH’ gas helmet was launched to combat the introduction of a new odourless, clear and deadly gas:
phosgene
. The PH stood for phenate-hexamine, a chemical solution effective at neutralising the gas. Phosgene was responsibility for 85% of all gas deaths in the First World War.,To warn against gases that carried no odour or colour in the trenches, gas alert rattles were employed, giving troops time to adorn their protective clothing. Rattles like these would later be adopted by fans in football grounds.,Gas warfare led to the establishment of
Porton Down
, the Government’s laboratory for research in biological and chemical weapons defence, which began as the War Department Experimental Ground in January 1916. The Science Museum recently acquired Porton’s
archive
.,As well as Porton, research on chemical weapons was also carried out at Imperial College, the Museum’s next-door neighbours in South Kensington. The Ministry of Munitions had assumed control of the chemistry department in 1914.,Two trenches were built behind the chemistry department to simulate conditions on the Western Front. Leading an all-female chemical warfare team at Imperial was
Martha Whiteley
(1866-1956), whose distinguished career, the excellent
Patricia Fara
notes in her recent
book
, was unique for a female chemist in the early 20
th
century.,Alongside chlorine and phosgene,
mustard gas
was one of the most-used chemical weapons during the war. It was less deadly than the other two, but more debilitating, causing horrendous burns. Whiteley heroically experimented with the first sample of this then-unidentified gas after its first use in 1917.,‘I naturally tested this property by applying a tiny smear to my arm and for nearly three months suffered great discomfort from the widespread open wound it caused in the bend of the elbow’.,Whiteley also developed a tear gas that was named ‘SK’ for South Kensington. The British press celebrated her achievement with the line: ‘the woman who makes the Germans weep’.,Her war work was recognised in 1920 with an OBE. She would become an influential campaigner for women in chemistry.

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/bob-edwards-and-ivf/,Martin Johnson,Bob Edwards and IVF,Professor Martin Johnson explores the difficulties experienced by physiologist and Nobel laureate Bob Edwards in his pioneering IVF work.,"At the Museum,Exhibitions and Galleries,Research","biology,genetics,ivf,research,science","When Bob Edwards was awarded the 2010 Nobel prize for Physiology or Medicine, few realised what a remarkable achievement this was. If one compares this ultimate accolade with the early hostility, both professional and social, experienced by Bob, the turnaround is striking. How and why was this medical advance so stigmatized? Here I give you some examples in an attempt to answer these questions.,It was in 1965-66, when I was in my third undergraduate year at Cambridge that I first encountered Bob Edwards. I was so inspired by his lectures that I decided to postpone my intended clinical course and commenced a PhD with him the following autumn.,However, when it became known around the department that a student who had got a first class degree had decided to do a PhD with Bob, the other staff members took me to one side and asked why was I going to waste my time on research with that charlatan, who worked on stuff ‘down there’ and spoke to the press.,This reaction provided me with some of the arguments used to attack Bob, namely that he worked on eggs and spermatozoa, and that he was prepared to talk about his work to the media. The last criticism was commonly made at that time: Bob was also a pioneer in communicating with the public about science.,Infertility was also seen to be unimportant and this attitude was echoed by funders. When Edwards and Steptoe applied unsuccessfully in 1971 for a grant from the MRC they were asked why this area should be a priority when it didn’t help with population control, an argument still used spuriously today by some critics. Bob argued strongly that the infertile should not be penalized for the profligacy of the fertile. Indeed, he was motivated by the heart-rending letters he received from couples, who felt ‘abandoned by the medical profession to their infertility’.,It was not just British medico-scientists that criticized Bob and his work, but Americans too. Notably, James Watson and others attacked Edwards saying that monsters would be born. Similarly, a prominent, but unidentified, American mammalian developmental biologist is reported to have said that in her opinion the blastocysts grown
in vitro
were definitely abnormal and if implanted into a human uterus would almost certainly develop into monsters.,This hostile attitude towards IVF persisted until Louise Brown was born in 1978. However the battle wasn’t over. Edwards, Steptoe and Purdy were refused funding by the MRC again in 1981 and the matter moved to parliament in the 1980s when the moral status of the embryo would become the focus.,The overwhelming professional opposition to the work of Edwards and his colleagues in these early days was deeply isolating and depressing. Bob was largely sustained by the many letters of support that he received from couples who themselves ironically had also experienced the isolation and misery to which their untreated infertility had for so long exposed them.,IVF: 6 Million Babies Later

Throughout my journey, it appeared very few gave a thought to the other half in the relationship – the impact the treatment had for the man. When we first had the diagnosis of my infertility, I naively assumed that I would not be too affected by the treatment, as it was my wife who was about to undergo years of clinic appointments, injections and procedures.,﻿,[#HiddenFaces is a Fertility Network UK video. For more information and support visit
https://fertilitynetworkuk.org/
],In our case the fertility issue was down to me, several operations in my late teens left me infertile. I was diagnosed with
azoospermia
– a complete absence of sperm. Initially the first thing to get my head around was the diagnosis and realisation that I would never biologically father a child. Our only hope of the child we dreamed of would be to accept donor sperm and go down the IVF treatment route. To this day it is commonly perceived that fertility issues are down to the female. Most friends on hearing the news were quick to sympathise with my wife, not thinking that the root cause was my infertility. As men, we are much less keen on talking it seems, so while my wife reached out to friends, family and online support pages, I buried my head in the sand and tried to get on day to day without dealing with the emotional aspect of the condition.,The clinic offered us counselling prior to the treatment starting and after every failed cycle we were told we could have more sessions at any point. Thinking I knew better, I declined the offer, and only had the 1 session over the 7 years. I would like to see it mandated for couples going through the process to have counselling between each cycle, as in my opinion, men are better at complying with instruction than asking for help.,There are many sides to the journey of IVF that are not obvious at first. The emotional state it puts you in affects just about every part of your life. While trying to conceive, we changed jobs to reduce the stress, suffered financial difficulties balancing the cost of private treatment against keeping a roof over our head, and had family disagreements when it became too difficult to join the celebrations of welcoming siblings’ children into the world. I struggled the most with trying to support my wife when she wanted to try again, and I had to have the level head and persuade her to wait until we could afford the treatment.,I had no luck finding any real support online. I felt my concerns weren’t worthy of mentioning over the hundreds of females facing the physical treatment. I tried to find a men-only page, in the hope of speaking with people I could relate to, whilst not offending our partners. Getting nowhere with a group, I started my own. Using a social media platform I created a
male support page for men only
. After a slow start, thanks to media awareness and the charity Fertility Network UK, the group has over 700 members and a sister page to support those who have had success in IVF, so stories can be shared without upsetting those still trying.,IVF: 6 Million Babies Later
opens on 5 July to mark the 40th birthday of in vitro fertilisation. Celebrate at a special Lates event in conversation with Louise Brown and Roger Gosden.

","At the Museum,Collections and Objects","chemistry,materials,plastics,recycling,science","The World Cup itself. The greatest prize in football; a global, cultural icon; a misnomer for pedants (it’s not actually a cup).,There have been two trophies. The first was indeed a cup, originally called
Victory
before being renamed in 1946 to honour
Jules Rimet
, the FIFA President who initiated the competition.,The original trophy depicted the winged figure
Nike
, Greek goddess of victory. It was made of gold-plated silver, initially with a marble base which was replaced with a lapis lazuli one in 1954.,Just before the 1966 World Cup (who won that one again?), the trophy was stolen before being famously retrieved by a
dog named Pickles
. For security, England’s Football Association made a replica in secret.,At the following World Cup in 1970, winners Brazil were awarded the trophy for keeps, which was then stolen in 1983. This time there was no Pickles and it has never been recovered. It is thought to have been melted down.,Until 2016 it was unclear whether it was the replica or the original that survived in the
National Football Museum
. Scientists at the University of Manchester solved the riddle by revealing its chemical composition using an X-ray scanner. They found evidence for tin and lead, but no silver, concluding it must be the replica.,The current trophy, introduced in 1974, is made of 18 carat gold, and shows a football globe held up by a man and a woman. In a
2010 video
, the chemist
Martyn Poliakoff
speculated that it must be mostly hollow, as a solid-gold trophy would weigh around 70kg and be too heavy for players to lift above their heads.,The trophy’s green bands are made from the mineral
malachite
, used since Antiquity in pigment paint and for decorative purposes.,An example of decorative malachite from the Science Museum Group collection is this
armillary sphere
, which illustrates the old earth-centred view of the cosmos – brass circles representing the sun and the moon rotate around the green malachite earth in the middle. It is the closest equivalent to the World Cup in our astronomy collections.,The 1970s witnessed the introduction of synthetic materials in World Cup footballs, when Adidas became the sole manufacturer of the official balls. Their first ball for the 1970 World Cup in Mexico was the iconic Telstar, named after the series of
spherical US communication satellites
that broadcasted the World Cup over the globe.,The
Adidas Telstar
was the last fully-leather ball. Its successor, the Telstar Durast, featured a plastic polyurethane coating to make it water resistant as leather balls become heavy with rain.,The first entirely synthetic ball was the
Adidas Azteca
used at the 1986 World Cup in Mexico, featuring an Aztec-inspired design – the beginning of the trend to reflect an aspect of the host nation in the ball’s design.,The next biggest innovation in waterproofing came in 2006 when Adidas teamed up with
Bayer
, the German pharma and chemical giants, to patent a thermal bonding process that meant ball seams were heat sealed, rather than sewn. We have
one of these balls
in the collection.,It also meant the balls could be almost perfectly spherical, influencing the flight of the ball. As
Franz Beckenbauer
, the former German World Cup winner said in 2006:,‘These are completely different materials that the scientists have come up with. Holding the ball in your hands, it feels completely different from the footballs of 40 or 50 years ago’.,The World Cup kit has become a symbol of national identity, bringing colour to the competition. Some transcend nationhood for their sheer design beauty. The BBC recently hosted a
World Cup of kits
(shockingly Germany’s classy 1990s strip didn’t win).,The classic, garish and elaborate designs we know today were made possible by synthetic material. which arrived in the 1950s, kits having been made from wool and cotton prior to that. Aside from design and sponsorship, the main aims in improving shirt material has been to reduce heat and sweat.,In 2010 Nike struck upon a
great idea
both in terms of its PR and, more importantly, the environment: football kits made from recycled plastic bottles.,That year Brazil, The Netherlands, Portugal, USA, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Serbia, and Slovenia all had green (not literally) kits.,It seems they have adopted the practice since. England sported them in 2014, and now, most appropriately, the green-jerseys of Nigeria are made by this method, saving over 2 billion bottles going to landfill.,As we become more aware of the environmental threat of plastics, there is now a new pride in owning a completely rubbish kit.,Don’t miss our

th
-century American essayist and philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson.,To celebrate the award of another major prize to her Humboldt biography,
The Invention of Nature: The Adventures of Alexander von Humboldt, the Lost Hero of Science
, author
Andrea Wulf
discussed her critically-acclaimed book about the Prussian polymath, geographer, naturalist, explorer and scientist
in the museum
with
Gaia Vince
, a fellow winner of the Royal Society Insight Investment Science Book Prize.,,Wulf explained to the packed lecture theatre that he was the ‘Shakespeare of the sciences’ in his day when ‘the whole world was utterly in love with Humboldt.’,This ‘forgotten father of environmentalism’ predicted harmful human-induced climate change and remains relevant today because he viewed nature as a ‘web of life’, pioneered the idea of the ecosystem and even described the Earth as a ‘living organism’,
which chimes with ‘Gaia’
, a holistic view of the world that the independent scientist James Lovelock put forward in the 20
th
century.,It was no accident, Wulf added, that Humboldt was a friend of fellow German polymath Johann Wolfgang Goethe (1749 – 1832) and had many encounters with indigenous peoples, which together ‘inspired him to think differently about nature’.,During his extraordinary life, Humboldt voyaged through unexplored jungles and mountains in the Americas, met many of the most important figures of his age, and influenced many key figures, not least Charles Darwin.,He was at the heart of a spider’s web of contacts, sending over 50,000 letters in his lifetime and receiving over 100,000, as he added thousands of species of plants and animals to European knowledge, as well as transforming understanding across many fields.,Humboldt ‘understood nature in a new way,’ said Vince, who spent years investigating humankind’s relationship and impact on nature, just as Humboldt had done two centuries earlier.,Vince is the author of
Adventures in the Anthropocene: A Journey to the Heart of the Planet we Made
, which describes her two-and-a-half-year journey to explore our relationship with our planet, and how we are changing the climate, ocean currents, agriculture and cities.,The term ‘Anthropocene’ – from anthropo- for ‘man,’ and -cene, for ‘new’ – refers to how humankind has caused mass extinctions, polluted the oceans and altered or destroyed ecosystems.,Vince described how in her travels she came across Humboldt’s name again and again in South America, where it is borne by a squid, penguin, volcanoes, mountains and river, along with ‘a great upwelling current that gives life to the Pacific’.,Humboldt was a ‘remarkable man living at an extraordinary time,’ Vince said, adding ‘there is no more brilliant guide to Humboldt than Andrea Wulf’, who is now turning her multiple-award winning biography into a graphic novel.,The event was held to celebrate Wulf’s book being awarded the Dingle Prize for the best history of science book for non-specialist readers by the
British Society for the History of Science
.,Vince and Wulf were introduced by Society President, Patricia Fara, author and history of science lecturer at the University of Cambridge.,‘The British Society for the History of Science was delighted to work with the Science Museum to celebrate this fascinating book, winner of their Dingle Prize’, said Tim Boon, Head of Research & Public History at the Science Museum, and current Vice President of the Society.,The event was also supported by the Royal Society.  Since 1988, the
Royal Society Insight Investment Science Book Prize
has celebrated outstanding popular science authors.,Header mage:

Total Darkness
with the aim of creating an experience that can have a positive impact on people’s attitudes towards STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths), as well as having a focus on self-reflection, rather than asking players to recall specific facts or concepts.,Total Darkness
has been shaped and informed by research into
science capital
and the Science Museum Group’s approach to informal science learning. It is a digital storytelling experience which encourages young people to recognise how the skills they use every day relate to STEM and can help them develop their confidence in science thinking.,,Created in partnership with Bristol-based design agency
Thought Den
, the game invites the player to solve a mysterious power cut in their hometown. The game puts players in control, allowing their choices and decisions to guide them through the story.,As the player navigates through the darkened streets of the town, armed only with a torch, they will face various challenges, from lost pets to melting ice cream. Using their curiosity, communication skills and creative problem solving they will discover new theories about what might have caused the blackout.,,But with every step their torch fades, and the player must solve the mystery before the battery runs out. There are five theories to find and disprove in order to solve the power outage and win the game.,The player’s choices and actions throughout the game will score them curiosity, creativity or communication points. At the end, the skills the player has used will be revealed along with their science style, showing how they could put their skills into action in the real world.,,Total Darkness
is aimed at 7-13 year-olds – an important stage in children’s science development.  Research shows that as children make the step between primary and secondary, many move away from an interest in science as other influences have a stronger pull in their lives.,We hope that this game can be one factor that helps positively influence their relationship with STEM subjects – enabling them to see it as something that can play an important role in their future.,Total Darkness

This was the place and time of the last known sighting of Russia’s former Tsar Nicholas II and his family. A century later, here at the Science Museum we’re opening an exhibition exploring the medical science behind the key events of the Romanovs’ lives – and deaths.,Our exhibition
The Last Tsar: Blood and Revolution
will retrace the lives of Nicholas II and Tsarina Alexandra as they navigated their roles as autocratic rulers of Russia, while caring for their young son and heir, who was born with haemophilia B. The royal household faced a turbulent backdrop of social upheaval and war between 1900 and 1918, but we’ll be focusing on the significant influence of medicine on the private lives of the imperial family. Over 70 years after their sudden disappearance, advances in medicine and forensic science transformed the investigation into their fate and solved one of the greatest mysteries of the 20th century.,The Romanov court will be coming to life at the Science Museum with rare artefacts such as the family’s personal diaries, private possessions and an imperial Fabergé egg the Tsar gave to his wife just a year before the fall of the imperial house. For the first time we’ll be displaying photo albums created by an English tutor to the imperial family, which are now part of the Science Museum Group collection. These albums offer a fascinating glimpse into the lives of the Romanovs – from boating trips and picnics, to sledging in the snowy grounds of their palace.,For many years Tsar Nicholas II and his wife Tsarina Alexandra longed for a son and heir to continue the Romanov dynasty. But their son Alexei was born with haemophilia B – the infamous ‘royal disease’ – a rare blood condition passed down from Queen Victoria. The family kept his condition secret and withdrew from public life, relying on help from doctors and controversial healers such as Rasputin. They were determined that no-one would know about Alexei’s illness – but their actions ultimately contributed to the fall of the 300-year-old dynasty.,In 1917, following revolutions in Russia, Tsar Nicholas II abdicated for himself and his son. Shortly afterwards the family were put under house arrest, and in July 1918 they disappeared. The investigation into the disappearance started in 1918 and remains open today. In our exhibition we’ll be showing original evidence from the scene of the family’s execution, including a single diamond earring belonging to the Tsarina, a damaged icon and dentures belonging to their doctor.,It wasn’t until over 70 years later that forensic scientists could piece together the events of that night. In 1991 there was a public announcement that some remains had been found near Ekaterinburg. The question in everyone’s minds was – could this be the Tsar and his family?,Leading experts from the UK’s Forensic Science Service were called upon to investigate the remains using modern DNA profiling. But at the time no-one had ever tested a sample as old as the Romanov bones, so the investigators couldn’t be sure it would work.,Relatives of the imperial family, including the Duke of Fife and Princess Xenia Cheremeteff Sfiri, gave blood samples to the scientists, which they compared to the remains. The investigation reached convincing conclusions.,One hundred years since its launch the investigation is still officially ongoing. For the first time we’ll be showing the original notes including the DNA profile of Tsar Nicholas II from the century-long forensic investigation into this historic case.,Explore the extraordinary lives and deaths of Tsar Nicholas II and his family and go behind the scenes to uncover the science behind one of the greatest mysteries of the 20th century in our free exhibition

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/brougham-brougham/,Rachel Boon,"Brougham, Brougham!","Curator of Technology and Engineering, Rachel Boon, welcomes a new addition to our Making the Modern World Gallery.",At the Museum,making the modern world,"It’s time to get carriage(d) away, there’s a new vehicle on display in
Making the Modern World
. With
Rocket
, the first modern steam locomotive,
on tour in Newcastle
we’re excited to reveal the original Brougham carriage!,The Brougham
(pronounced ‘broom’) marked a significant change in the design of horse-drawn carriages. It was built by London coach-builder Robinson & Cook in 1838 to the specifications of Lord Henry Brougham, after whom it is named.,Lord Brougham was Britain’s Lord Chancellor from 1830 to 1834. As a member of parliament, he campaigned for education, legal reform, and the abolition of slavery. Lord Brougham was also a co-founder of and prolific contributor to the
Edinburgh Review
, one of the most influential publications of the 19th century, covering topics from science to poetry.,This really was the leader of the pack. Unlike the high, heavy, bulky coaches of the time, the Brougham was a light and compact carriage that could be drawn by a single horse. Cheaper to buy and ideal for travelling around busy streets, the new carriage became an instant success with middle-class and wealthy families.,The carriage was designed to be cosy and intimate with space for two forward-facing passengers inside and room for a third next to the coachmen. Broughams and the Clarence, which developed from it, were the most popular types of closed carriages built in the late nineteenth century. They influenced the construction of carriages across the world and even early car designs.,Recognising its historical importance, the carriage’s fourth owner Earl Bathurst presented this Brougham to the Worshipful Company of Coachmakers and Coach Harness Makers in 1894, from whom it has been on loan to the Science Museum since 1895.,The Brougham
is on display in our
Making the Modern World
gallery."
https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/stephensons-rocket-returns-newcastle/,David Rooney,Stephenson’s Rocket returns to Newcastle,"The Science Museum Group is delighted to announce that it will be lending Robert Stephenson’s Rocket, one of Britain’s most famous feats of engineering, to the Great Exhibition of the North 2018.","At the Museum,Collections and Objects,Science in the news","conservation,engineering,history,science museum group,stem,transport","The Science Museum Group is delighted to announce that it will be lending
Robert Stephenson’s
Rocket
, one of Britain’s most famous feats of engineering, to the Great Exhibition of the North 2018.,July 2018 Update: Rocket will also return to the
Liverpool Road station it served 180 years ago
when it goes on display at the
Museum of Science and Industry
in Manchester from September 2018 to April 2019. Later in 2019, Rocket will
go on long term display
at the
National Railway Museum
in York.,Manufactured in 1829 by Robert Stephenson and Company at Newcastle’s Forth Street Works, close to today’s Newcastle Central railway station,
Rocket
won the famous Rainhill Trials  the same year to become the fastest locomotive ever built up to that point.,The Rainhill Trails were a major public competition held in October 1829 by the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, the world’s first main-line railway, to find a new, more efficient form of locomotion.,When
Rocket
’s
turn came it completed the trials at an average speed of 15 miles per hour. It later made celebratory runs in front of the crowds at Rainhill that set a world speed record of 35 miles per hour, three times
Rocket
’s design speed.,In his attempt to win the prize of £500 (worth approximately £50,000 today) the 25-year-old Robert Stephenson combined several innovations with his new locomotive
Rocket
to improve efficiency and performance. As
Rocket
was built as a prototype, the production models made soon after were more refined. But
Rocket
had already secured its place in history: the basic design was ground-breaking and paved the way for subsequent main-line steam locomotive design.,Since its donation to the Patent Office Museum in 1862 and its subsequent transfer to the Science Museum,
Rocket
has been heralded as an iconic object and a potent symbol of Britain’s industrial heritage.,The significant role
Rocket
plays in telling the story of British industrial innovation can be seen in its inclusion in the major 1998 Science Museum touring exhibition to Japan, ‘Treasures of the Science Museum’, part of the Festival ’98 British cultural event.,On its return to Britain,
Rocket
was taken straight from Heathrow Airport to the
National Railway Museum
, York, where it was on display throughout 1999.,Early in 2000
Rocket
was brought back to South Kensington for display in the Science Museum’s landmark
Making the Modern World
gallery. A working replica is held by the National Railway Museum.,Now, as Newcastle and Gateshead celebrate one year to go until the official launch of the Great Exhibition of the North 2018, the Science Museum Group is making plans to transport this historic locomotive to the city in which it was built for the first time since 1862, allowing people across the country to admire this incredible feat of engineering and design."
https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/the-strange-allure-of-sad-songs-and-other-musical-mysteries/,Roger Highfield,"The strange allure of sad songs, and other musical mysteries","Roger Highfield discusses an improvised musical encounter between musician Joe Stilgoe, polymath Philip Ball and the Museum’s IMAX audience.",At the Museum,"Events,lates,music and sound","The
Grandstand
theme tune, played in the eclectic style of Prince, was one of the stranger compositions mashed up at the bidding of the museum’s IMAX audience by
Joe Stilgoe
at a recent event to explore the science of music and mood with Philip Ball, author of
The Music Instinct
.,Listen here:,Earlier that evening in the IMAX the acclaimed singer, pianist and songwriter had – following the suggestions of the audience – created a birthday medley to
celebrate the 40th of Louise Brown
, the first IVF baby.,Stilgoe declared at the start of the encounter with Ball that he was happy to come to the museum both to impress his scientist brother, Jack Stilgoe, and ‘to claw back my double C in combined science at GCSE’.,Ball, on the other hand, was keen to both explore the science of music and marvel at Joe Stilgoe’s technical prowess: ‘I still don’t quite get how Joe fits the entire encyclopaedia of music into his mind’.,To set the scene for the evening of improvised insights, MCed by the museum’s own Jon Milton, Ball wrote a
blog
and began the night by describing the remarkable human capacity to rapidly make sense of music and respond with emotions.,‘It is an extraordinary complex acoustic signal,’ he said. Even so, within a quarter of a second, people are able to discern a song along with its genre: ‘We are all musical’.,Every human culture enjoys music, and there are many theories to explain why. Some say that it creates a sense of community, while the Harvard Professor of Psychology Steven Pinker dismisses music as little more than ‘auditory cheesecake’.,But, though controversial, many suspect that there is an evolutionary explanation. Charles Darwin thought music was to do with sexual selection: ‘Look at me and how big my guitar is,’ joked Ball.,Perhaps music taps into the pattern-seeking mental machinery in the brain that says ‘If I hear the call of a sabre tooth tiger, I ought to get going’ he said, though he added that brain scan studies suggest it involves the reward circuits activated by food, sex and drugs. ‘You are getting a high from the music.’,Drawing on the suggestions from the audience, Ball and Stilgoe explored what made a happy song uplifting, the science of sad songs, the art of improvisation and then, as a grand finale, experimented with how to make a happy dirge.,In the first improvisation session, Stilgoe created a mash up of three ‘happy’ songs suggested by the audience: Nina Simone’s
Feeling Good
, Stevie Wonder’s
Sir Duke
and Gene Kelly’s
Singin’ in the Rain.,Listen here:,Why are they perceived as happy? Stilgoe said nostalgia was one factor when, for example, it comes to
Singin’ in the Rain
. Ball added that, as one 1930s psychologist remarked, music sounds like emotions feel. Or ‘music is the shorthand of emotion,’ as Leo Tolstoy famously put it.,The way music maps onto emotion can be quite literal. The octave jump in
Singin’ in the Rain
‘mimics, in the shape of music, the emotion we want to invoke,’ said Ball, adding that the same tonal leap can be heard in the uplifting ballad,
Over the Rainbow
.,Both agreed that timbre is a factor, with Ball adding that it must be ‘sharp and cutting’ to be upbeat.,When it came to the sad songs, the audience suggestions selected by Joe Stilgoe were
Yesterday
by the Beatles,
Why Does it Always Rain on Me?
by Travis, along with Arthur Hamilton’s
Cry Me a River.,Listen here:,We are drawn to sad songs and the reason why is a fundamental question, said Ball. ‘One possibility is that it is cathartic,’ he said. A dirge ‘allows us to explore that emotion without having anything tragic associated with it.’,What he found fascinating was that ‘we are powerless’ to resist the emotional tug of sad music, even when – as is often the case in Hollywood movies – it is transparently manipulative and toe-curlingly sentimental.,‘Music,’ said Ball, ‘bypasses the rational brain.’,Some have wondered if it is possible to craft a perfectly happy or sad song. In a BBC4 programme,
The Secret Science Of Pop
, Prof Armand Leroi, an evolutionary biologist from Imperial College London, analysed the data from 17,000 chart toppers and then — with the help of Trevor Horn and singer-songwriter Niké Jemiyo — attempted to manufacture the perfect pop hit.,Though many insights emerged, the experiment did not work, said Philip Ball. ‘There is something ineffable about music that seems to resist that kind of analysis.’ Many hits rely on surprise, on adding something new, he said. ‘We can science it as much as we like, we can’t get to the bottom of it.’,And even though different cultures are ‘pretty good’ at working out the mood of other culture’s music, said Ball, we often make assumptions about the mood of minor and major scales, so cultural conditioning also plays a role.,Guided by Milton, they turned to the science of improvisation itself. Given the physical constraints of getting inside a MRI scanner, there have been few studies of brain activity while playing an instrument but those that have been done have provided insights.,As Geoff Goodhill of the University of Queensland has explained,
improvisation draws on two key neural circuits
– the default network, which is most active when the mind is wandering, and the executive control network, which becomes more active when focused on a task.,In jazz improvisation, the default network likely allows the musician to riff around a basic structure laid down by executive control.,At the end of the evening, Jon Milton challenged his guests to turn a dirge into a storming finale. The first attempt saw Stilgoe play the audience suggestion of  Harry Nilsson’s
Without You
in the style of Chas & Dave, Ball’s wildly inappropriate suggestion.,Listen here:,Radiohead’s
Creep
, first in the style of the jazz pianist Thelonious Monk, then Brazil’s Bossa nova, brought the evening to an impressively offbeat end.,If the hour of seemingly effortless improvisation proved anything at all about the science of music, and the inclinations of our pattern-hungry brains, it was that we do indeed all love music for the sake of sheer enjoyment.,"
https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/muriel-harris-nursing-ivf-to-success/,John Webster,Muriel Harris: Nursing IVF to success,"John Webster recalls his time working alongside Muriel Harris, who played an important and integral role in the development of IVF research.",Exhibitions and Galleries,"ivf,medicine,women in science","Muriel Harris was the theatre superintendent both the Oldham Royal Infirmary and at Oldham and District General Hospital. She played an important and integral part in early IVF research and its later development.,When the collaborative work of Patrick Steptoe and
Bob Edwards
started in Oldham in 1969 it took place at Oldham and District General Hospital. However, because of the lack of suitable space in the theatre complex for Bob and the lab technician,
Jean Purdy
, in 1971 the research moved to Kershaw’s Hospital.,Kershaw’s was a small cottage hospital used by the GPs, it was situated about a mile or so from the main hospital. There was an operating theatre adjacent to which was a small room that was ideal for Bob’s purposes. Neither were being used and both were empty. For £200 Muriel equipped the theatre with a second-hand operating table and an old anaesthetic machine!,So as not to interfere with routine NHS work, the egg collections [for the IVF treatment] were done at antisocial hours, either early in the morning or late at night. Occasionally Bob wanted to have one done at other times, and Muriel could always arrange for the necessary staff to be in attendance. She had a group of eight on whom she could call to set up and assist at Kershaw’s. This was all done on their own time and unpaid.,Incidentally, there was no theatre changing room and we had to get into our togs by getting changed together in a tiny room with brooms and cleaning materials. It was a bit of a squeeze when we all arrived at the same time!,Before Louise Brown was born there were many disappointments and at times we got very disheartened, but Muriel, as well as giving the nursing support, provided a great deal of moral support. She had a positive outlook, an attitude which helped everyone.,The IVF programme in Oldham closed shortly after the birth of Louise when Steptoe retired from the NHS. The team then went on to open Bourn Hall,
the world’s first IVF clinic
, in 1980. Muriel became the matron of Bourn Hall and she not only interviewed for nurses, housekeeping and cleaning staff but also equipped the operating theatre and the wards. The place had been empty for some time so Muriel, with a number of her loyal colleagues, got together with the domestic staff to give the place a thorough clean!,Muriel was a ‘one off’ – a great nurse who was blessed with superb organisational skills, and her input toward the IVF programme both in Oldham and Bourn Hall was immense. Without Muriel’s support, who knows what may have happened.,Bob Edwards and Patrick Steptoe got the accolades and recognition which they undoubtedly deserved, although Patrick unfortunately died before he had the chance to share the Nobel Prize with Bob and receive knighthoods together. Recently Jean Purdy, who died some years ago, had her work recognised in an inscription on a new headstone.,In 2007 Muriel died aged 84 and it seems wrong to me, and so many of her nursing colleagues that Muriel never got the recognition she so richly deserved. The efforts she made helped ensure the success and continuance of IVF, a technique which has now led to over six million babies being born throughout the world.,Explore the remarkable story of in vitro fertilisation from the opposition and immense challenges faced by early pioneers to the latest research today in

Was there a specific moment or event that inspired it?,COREY BAKER: On a human level, I have always been fascinated by Antarctica, probably more so because I grew up in Christchurch and visited the Antarctica centre frequently as a boy. As an artist, Antarctica also captivated me – a barely populated place with very few man-made constructions, a place that is beyond beautiful – more than any picture, painting, piece of music or film. My love for Antarctica was always there and grew even stronger through this project. I have been lucky enough to choreograph in many unusual locations before, which gave me a great foundation for working on
Antarctica: The First Dance
.,,I wanted to highlight Antarctica’s epic landscape and vast beauty, but at the same time show that it is under threat – climate change impact is real and immediate. By showing up-close the beauty of this incredible place, people can feel closer to something that may otherwise seem abstract and unconnected. As an individual, I aim to take conscious steps to help mitigate climate change, and wanted to inspire others to do the same.,SM: What have you enjoyed most so far about showcasing your new dance at the Science Museum for Antarctica Live?,CB: Our dance film
Antarctica: The First Dance
has been viewed over 1.5 million times online, and although I believe digital engagement is important and offers a way to access vast amount of people, it was really important for me to have a live experience for people to engage with.,Antarctica Live brings together all our digital elements with a brand new dance performance and interactive workshops. I am so thrilled to be collaborating with the Science Museum and to be able to offer people a new way of learning about Antarctica through art and science.,SM: Tell us about your trip to Antarctica to film
Antarctica: The First Dance
. What did you learn about the continent while you were there?,CB: Scott Base is the New Zealand base in Antarctica, 20 minutes away from the American base. There was a gym, shop, sauna, workshop lab, science labs, computer rooms, library, table tennis, and rock-climbing wall… It was very comfortable, and you don’t have to go outside, as there’s a corridor that links everything together. We spent nights and some of our days in there. It fits about 130 people – it was full of scientists and community engagement people.,In Antarctica you can’t leave anything anywhere – every day you get designated a pee and poo bucket, which you have to clean out and bring back. By the end of the trip I was cleaning out everyone else’s [bucket] as I’d got used to it. There’s no private room for it, you just carry it round with you and go when you need.,I loved being there – but there was a mixture of being in a place I’d always wanted to be as a human, seeing things I never thought I’d see. Things that were there naturally that artists could spend years trying to create. I felt thankful and lucky and honoured, it was like Christmas day on repeat, every day.,I came away with a profound respect for the planet and a huge sense of responsibility – I don’t want to say I’ve contributed to the destruction of the most beautiful place on the planet.,SM: What were the biggest challenges you faced in Antarctica?,CB: Obviously, the actual dancing in the snow was extremely hard, and unpredictable – we sometimes suddenly found ourselves in a meter of snow! The cold was obviously a challenge on an hourly basis. Maddy [Graham] doesn’t even wear gloves in the film!,It was very hard and strenuous on Maddy, as she wasn’t able to rehearse and refine. Everything was going against us – Maddy had never been in snow, camping, in a film, or in a dorm room. She was completely out of her comfort zone. It’s the opposite of what a dancer needs to thrive: no sleep, 24-hour light, unstable ground and it was obviously very cold outside.,Antarctica was the director: it would tell you it’s too windy, too bright, or too cold. We had to listen and respond to that.,SM: Did you meet any penguins?,CB: Yes – we saw a bunch of penguins.,And we were at Scott’s Hut one Sunday and heard crackling… When we looked, we saw three orcas next to us bobbing their heads above the sea ice. They were dancing in the water, water coming out of their blowholes. It was beautiful. Maddy ended up dancing on the hill overlooking them. I even ended up adopting a whale, it’s called Corey.,Antarctica Live took place at the Science Museum from
14-30 August 2018.,It was accompanied by the premier of Dancing on Icebergs, a documentary following Corey and Maddy as they venture out into the extreme cold of Antarctica to film Antarctica: The First Dance. This was followed by a live Q&A with Corey. The event took place on Wednesday 29 August at

These works are part of our ongoing commitment to continue to inspire our visitors with our award-winning exhibition programme and world-class collection of iconic objects and stories of scientific achievement from across the globe.,One of the biggest new developments is our major new
Medicine Galleries
, which will showcase thousands of objects from our medicine collections for the next generation. Thanks to leadership funding from the Wellcome Trust, the Heritage Lottery Fund and the Wolfson Foundation, these six new permanent galleries will open in autumn 2019, transforming much of the first floor of the Museum and putting the history of medicine and biomedical research at the heart of the Science Museum.,As well as the Medicine Galleries, we are also in the middle of preparations for two major new exhibitions opening this autumn.,The Last Tsar: Blood and Revolution
, which explores the extraordinary lives and deaths of Tsar Nicholas II and his family and goes behind the scenes to uncover the science behind one of the greatest mysteries of the 20th century.,Meanwhile our blockbuster exhibition
The Sun: Living With Our Star
explores our ever changing relationship with our closest star, through spectacular interactive experiences, unique artefacts and stunning imagery, in what will be the largest exhibition ever staged on the Sun.,As well as this we will soon start works on another exciting new gallery that will open towards the end of next year, with more details to be announced shortly.,Right now though there is still a huge amount on offer for visitors to come explore, enjoy, and engage with at the Science Museum, from exploring the role mathematics has played in building our world in

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/voyaging-into-the-grey-zone-of-consciousness/,Science Museum,Voyaging into the grey zone of consciousness,Adrian Owen on communicating with vegative patients,"At the Museum,Research","biology,lates",",Adrian Owen, one of the pioneers of the use of ‘mind reading’ to communicate with patients with serious brain injury appeared at a packed ‘in conversation’ event in the Science Museum last night.,During a
Royal Society sponsored Lates
, Adrian Owen discussed his attempts to use brain scanners to communicate with vegetative patients over two decades with Roger Highfield, Director of External Affairs and author of
The Mind Readers,People in a ‘vegetative state’ are awake yet unaware. Although their eyes can open, they can smile, grasp another’s hand, cry, groan or grunt, they are unable to see or to understand speech. It is, says Owen, as if their minds are clamped firmly shut.,While working in Cambridge two decades ago, Owen made headlines worldwide by showing it was possible to use a brain scanner to find evidence of awareness in a supposedly ‘vegetative’ patient, Kate Bainbridge.,He showed that Kate could react to faces: her brain responses were indistinguishable from those of healthy volunteers. Of course, whether that response was a reflex or a signal of consciousness was, at the time, a matter of debate.,Unusually for these patients, Bainbridge surfaced from being vegetative six months after the initial diagnosis and described how she was indeed sometimes aware of herself and her surroundings.,She wrote to him:,Dear Adrian,,Please use my case to show people how important the scans are. I want more people to know about them. I am a big fan of them now. I was unresponsive and looked hopeless, but the scan showed people I was in there.,It was like magic, it found me.,Highfield and Owen also discussed the case of Scott Routley who had been diagnosed as vegetative since an accident on 20 December 1999, and was confirmed as vegetative in 2012.,,Owen scanned Scott several times. By that time he had worked out how to communicate with patients trapped in the grey zone, by asking Routley to imagine playing tennis for yes, and navigating the house for no.,To his surprise, the patterns of brain activity in response to his questions showed Scott knew exactly who he was, and where he was and that he was actively choosing to answer the questions.,“My heart stopped when we asked Scott if, after 12 years, he was in pain,” Owen recalls. “Thankfully, the answer was no.”,With Highfield, the then editor of New Scientist, Prof Owen also conducted
the world’s biggest intelligence test
, the results of which were published in the journal
Neuron
.,Next month, Owen is going to launch the
largest ever study of the effects of sleep
on cognition by encouraging hundreds of thousands of volunteers to report on their sleeping habits and undergo online tests.,Later this year a book written by Owen will detail his extraordinary work on disorders of consciousness, entitled ‘
Into the Grey Zone: A Neuroscientist Explores the Border Between Life and Death

",Exhibitions and Galleries,,"Imagine if the displays at our great national museums never changed; no temporary exhibitions, the same objects on gallery and therefore the same ones in storage. This is to imagine our future as it would be without external funding. Government support is critical to our work as museums and funds the care of our collections. However, it does not cover the considerable cost of the ambitious programming or modernisation that is helping the five museums in the Science Museum Group to thrive.,A variety of single-interest pressure groups want us to end our relationship with whatever sector offends their particular cause, whether that be pharmaceutical, aeronautics or, most recently, energy. But, as the Museums Association has pointed out, there cannot be a one-size-fits-all solution to sponsorship issues such as holding “a list of proscribed companies or industries that museums should avoid.” Campaigners use colourful language to describe relationships through which we gain vital funds and our partners benefit through association with our brand. Yet enlightened self-interest is central to the idea of sponsorship. At the Science Museum Group, we actively seek out businesses whose long-term interests are served by our mission to inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers. What better grounds for a partnership could there be than common cause around the need for that most critical of raw materials, brainpower?,,This week we launched a major new initiative to help address the challenge of low engagement with science and tackle the STEM skills shortage in the UK. Supported by BP, the Science Museum Group Academy will be the UK’s first dedicated centre of excellence for practitioners in the informal STEM sector. It will provide research-led science engagement training, support and resources for thousands of teachers, museum and STEM professionals, improving the quality and provision of informal science learning experiences in the UK and beyond. The Academy is building on a previous five-year partnership with King’s College London and University College, that was also supported by BP, examining how people’s relationship with science can be deepened through formal and informal experiences. In seeking long-term partnerships with sponsors that share our goals, we are able to think big and develop activities such as the Academy that will help address an urgent need for STEM professionals across the UK.,Any company that wishes to work with the Science Museum Group has to accept that editorial control sits firmly with the museum. Our independence covers both the interpretation around particular objects and the broad direction of our programme. As a science museum, it’s important that we explore issues such as global warming and our
Atmosphere
Gallery, which outlines the workings of the carbon cycle and the tough challenges we face, has been visited by more than four million people since it opened. Funding from Shell supported the creation of this gallery – and an exhibition about Jim Lovelock, the pioneer of Gaia theory and someone who sounded early warnings about severe climate change. The driving force behind
Atmosphere
was my predecessor, Prof Chris Rapley, who has a considerable reputation as a pioneering environmental scientist, has been eloquent about the need to engage with industry as well as government and the general public in seeking solutions to the global issue of climate change.,,The Science Museum Group’s stance is that external sponsorship is not only necessary, it is a positive aspect of the way we work. While I acknowledge the passion of campaigners who would rather we turned our backs on a variety of business sectors, I strongly believe we are making the right decisions to secure the long-term future of the museum for the public good."
https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/11-things-you-might-not-know-about-bepicolombo/,Abbie MacKinnon,11 things you might not know about BepiColombo,"A new spacecraft has landed at the Science Museum: the Structural Thermal Model of BepiColombo, developed to test the strength of the spacecraft when on its mission to Mercury. Here are some interesting facts you might not know about this challenging mission...","At the Museum,Collections and Objects,Exhibitions and Galleries","astronomy,ESA,space","A joint mission between the European Space Agency and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, BepiColombo is the first ever two-spacecraft mission to Mercury. The two satellites will go into separate orbits around Mercury. This is a unique aspect of the mission. These synchronised satellite orbits will provide scientists with detailed sets of data which will give them a fuller picture of the planet.,It is only the third ever mission to Mercury. NASA has sent two spacecraft to Mercury: Mariner 10 passed the planet three times in the 1970s and MESSENGER orbited it from 2011-2015. Scientists are still analysing MESSENGER data today.,BepiColombo is named after mathematician and engineer, Professor Giuseppe ‘Bepi’ Colombo. Colombo studied Mercury and calculated how to get a spacecraft into a successful orbit around the planet. His contribution to our understanding of Mercury led the European Space Agency to name their cornerstone mission after him.,Around 1200 engineers and scientists from 16 different countries have worked on this mission since 2000, and the flight model will launch on an Ariane 5 rocket from French Guiana in South America.,The BepiColombo on display is a twin of the flight model and is called a Structural Thermal Model. It was used to test the structure of the spacecraft and is vital to the success of the Mission. It was tested in the Multishaker and the Acoustic Chamber to make sure it could withstand the vibrations of launch. It was also tested in the Large Space Simulator which checked it could manage the temperature extremes during the journey.,BepiColombo will experience Mercury’s dramatic temperature changes, reaching 400°C on the sun side and -190°C on the night side. Everything on the spacecraft is designed to protect it from the heat and radiation.,Part of this protection is a special space blanket which is made up of 97 layers of aluminium, plastic and glass ceramic fabrics. This insulation blanket was specially developed for the Mission and helps to keep the onboard instruments as close to room temperature as possible.,BepiColombo also has a special radiator which moves the heat from inside the spacecraft out into deep space. The flight model has ‘fins’ covering the radiator which look like venetian blinds and help to protect BepiColombo from radiation. The test model on display in the Science Museum is missing its ‘fins’ because they will be flying to Mercury on the flight model!,It will take BepiColombo more than seven years to get to Mercury. It will have to take a very complex route there which involves coming back past Earth nearly two years after it launches in 2018. It will also fly past Venus twice and Mercury six times before settling into its orbits in late 2025.,,After launching, BepiColombo will be travelling too quickly to be able to put the two scientific satellites into their Mercury orbits. To help slow down, BepiColombo is fitted with four solar-electric ion thrusters. These thrusters use xenon for fuel and solar power for electricity. They are designed to fire in the opposite direction of travel and act as a brake, slowing BepiColombo down.,BepiColombo had key contributions from UK industries. The British made solar-electric ion thrusters for example, were made by the UK-based company, QinetiQ. This type of electric propulsion is a first for a mission to an inner planet.,BepiColombo also carries 16 instruments on board that will gather data about the surface and interior of Mercury as well as its magnetic field. Some of the instruments were developed by British scientists. The Mercury Imaging X-Ray Spectrometer, or MIXS, was developed by scientists from the University of Leicester and the University of Helsinki.,The University of Helsinki also developed the Solar Intensity X-ray Spectrometer, or SIXS, along with scientists from Aberystwyth. (MIXS is Finnish for ‘Why’? and SIXS is Finnish for ‘That’s Why’!) These two instruments work closely together to provide data on Mercury’s magnetosphere.,Come face-to-face with a full-size engineering model of BepiColombo at our free exhibit

before
the Big Bang of creation.,I was honoured to introduce Sir Roger, the University of Oxford Emeritus Rouse Ball Professor of Mathematics, for the second public lecture to be held in the museum by the university’s Mathematical Institute (the first was with
Sir Andrew Wiles
.),,Before him on Tuesday night in the IMAX sat a diverse audience, from schoolchildren to academics, including the Institute’s Mike Giles, Professor of Scientific Computing, and Martin Bridson, Whitehead Professor of Pure Mathematics, along with celebrities such as Dara O’Briain and Rachel Riley.,Over six decades, Sir Roger has visualised the unity between mathematics and the physical cosmos through his art, usually in the form of geometric drawings on transparencies for overhead projectors, and popularised his ideas with bestselling books that confound the claim of his former collaborator,
Stephen Hawking
, that every equation halves the popular readership.,He held the audience spellbound as he outlined his self-confessed ‘outrageous’ theory of cyclic cosmology, no less than a daisy-chain of universes, shown again on the IMAX screen as what looked like a multicoloured cosmic pipeline. ‘You get nice big pictures here’, he remarked.,He outlined his latest efforts to develop what he calls Conformal Cyclic Cosmology (CCC) which says that, instead of a single Big Bang, the universe cycles from one aeon to the next, each time starting out infinitely small and smooth before expanding and generating clumps of matter.,That matter eventually gets dragged into supermassive black holes which over the very long term (of the order of googol, that is 10 to the power of 100, years) ‘disappear with a pop’ by emitting Hawking radiation to set the stage for the next Big Bang.,Each universe leaves subtle imprints on the next cosmos when it pops into being, he told the audience: energy can ‘burst through’ from one universe to the next, at what he calls ‘Hawking points’.,However, this theory has gone down ‘very badly’ with his peers, he said. In response, there has been deathly silence: ‘that’s what we’ve had’.,In a
preprint on the arXiv server
, Sir Roger with Daniel An of the SUNY Maritime College in the United States and Krzysztof Meissner at the University of Warsaw in Poland – report scouring data from the European Space Agency’s Planck satellite and say they have evidence to support their CCC idea.,Some have questioned
their data analysis but he said that a new paper will show more than 99.9 per cent confidence in their Planck results. When it comes to their critics, he said, ‘all they have to do is look’.,After his talk, Sir Roger was interviewed by museum Trustee, author of
Hello World
and University College London Associate Professor Hannah Fry, who asked him of his CCC theory: is it a good crazy idea or just plain crazy?,To be the former, which is what Sir Roger believes, it has to be consistent with well-established physical facts, he replied. CCC is however ‘unbelievable on the basis of current cosmology’ but he added that cosmology teems with crazy ideas, from the Big Bang to inflation, the theory of exponential expansion of space in the early universe.,She asked him about his love of challenging conventional thinking with bold ideas. Sir Roger said it is probably down to his ‘big headedness’, or perhaps being indifferent to what others think.,He told the audience that though he adores mathematics, his agenda has been driven by physics – ‘how the world works’ – and perhaps this is why he has been so influential, applying mathematical insights to some of the deepest problems of all.,Sir Roger’s research has stretched from pioneering work on black holes with Stephen Hawking, to quantum ideas of consciousness, and to so called Penrose tiling, where absurdly simple two-dimensional symmetrical shapes, like distorted diamonds, can be used to create an infinite plane of patterns that never repeat. The latter has influenced the museum’s
Pattern Pod
aimed at younger children.,He is also a well-known critic of purportedly our most well-tested theory, quantum mechanics, which rules the subatomic world and, he says, is not only ‘self-inconsistent’ but also inconsistent with general relativity, our theory of gravity and the very big.,Sir Roger is not alone. Compared to him, he explained, Einstein was politer about quantum theory and simply said it was incomplete.,Sir Roger added that he hates the term ‘
dark energy
’, postulated to act in opposition to gravity and to account for much of the energy in the universe: ‘it is neither dark, nor energy’, he said. He prefers to call it ‘lambda’, referring to the ‘cosmological constant’ that
Einstein had used
to balance the force of gravity.,Their conversation ranged across many other themes, from Sir Roger’s childhood problem-solving skills being too leisurely for school (‘I was moved down a class’); to his doubts about wormholes; whether gravity really counts as a force (not really); the elegance of
twistor theory
, which he used to try to fuse the theories of quantum theory and relativity; along with the creative power of procrastination.,His love of geometry and art also resurfaced during the conversation in the form of his personal encounters with the Dutch graphic artist M. C. Escher.,He and Hannah Fry discussed the impossible structures of Escher along with the Penrose triangle, which Sir Roger devised with his father, the psychiatrist Lionel Penrose. The impossibility of these images make chimps feel queasy as well as humans, Sir Roger explained.,Paradoxically, however, impossible images can also be a boon for visualisation: Sir Roger showed the power of an Escher image – ‘Circle Limit 1’ – to represent infinity using hyperbolic geometry.,After the event, a reception was held in
Mathematics: The Winton Gallery
, designed by
Dame Zaha Hadid
. Hannah Fry remarked that Sir Roger is ‘one of the most fascinating, charming, impressive and mischievous people I’ve ever met’."
https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/burglars-beware/,Selina Hurley,Burglars Beware….,,Collections and Objects,communication,"This blog was written by Jared Keller, a part-time Explainer.,With so many visitors flying in from abroad, security has been a hot-button issue in the capital all summer. So much so that we here at the Science Museum thought we should offer our expertise and services to make sure everything goes off without a hitch. So we’re proud to offer this  – a 1930s “Burgot” Burglar and Fire Alarm.,,This wonder of mechanical ingenuity combines a gramophone, rotary telephone, and closed electric circuit into one of the world’s first automated burglar/fire alarms. If tripped, this machine would mechanically dial an emergency number, and play a (quite posh) pre-recorded message alerting the authorities to the situation – a video of which can be seen
here
(fast forward to 7:20).,Similar devices were also widely deployed as silent alarms in banks and other high security buildings. The unit was placed in a back room and connected to a foot trigger underneath the front desk. That way a clerk could alert the authorities even while the burglars thought they had the situation under control. The illustrations imagining the scenes are courtesy of
Matteo Farinella
, Neuroscience PhD at UCL, and science comic extraordinaire!
A journalist for the
Spokane Daily Chronicle
took special joy in one particular use of the Burgot when
he wrote
,,“armed robbers that enter a bank and ‘cover’ the cashiers with revolvers preparatory to gathering up the money, may find that they are not as secure from attack as the submissive men in front of them would indicate”.,Though it may appear rather quaint and low-tech to our twenty-first century eyes,
an article
in
The Age
reported that similar devices accounted for 67 arrests in Yorkshire in 1955 alone!,And lest you think this wonderful device could be outsmarted by simply cutting the power to the premises, the developers of the Burgot alarm system even had the foresight to wire in each device with its own power source hidden deep within the building. As the
1938 issue
of Gramophone Magazine waxed,,“even as the burglar fondly imagines he has cut all communications with the outside world, the treacherous voice of our mechanical informer is summoning swift retribution. Who would be a burglar?”,Indeed. With things like the Burgot around, who
would
be a burglar?!"

A series of battles that began with an Allied attack at the end of July finally petered out on the 10 November, as Canadian troops reached the objective whose name still resonates today.,Casualties were huge, but by 1917 this was no longer unexpected.,Indeed, 1917 would prove to be the British Army’s costliest year of the war. How our medical services, both near these battlefields and back home, attempted to cope with casualties on such a scale is the subject of our exhibition
Wounded: Conflict, Casualties and Care
, which remains at the Science Museum until next Summer.,1917 had been a year both of consolidation and change for those caring for the wounded. While medical services continued to be over-stretched much of the time, and totally overwhelmed at others, they had been transformed since the summer of 1914. Staff levels had multiplied, and valuable lessons had been learned from many months of treating and transporting those wounded in the inhospitable trench environment.,For the ‘chain of evacuation’, the system which potentially took a wounded man from the trenches to a hospital ship on the French coast, the largely static nature of the Western Front had proved advantageous. Casualty Clearing Stations, set some miles behind the frontlines, had originally been imagined as transient sites for sorting the wounded.,By November 1917, they were well established, well staffed and well-equipped field hospitals. Blueprints for the likes of Camp Bastion, the army’s medical unit established in Afghanistan many decades later.,Life-saving interventions were also proving their worth. New blood transfusion technology could revive those previously considered beyond help, while decades before penicillin the innovative Carrel-Dakin apparatus was providing some defense against wound infection.,Frontline experience also highlighted the value of best practice and good medical training. As medicine came ever closer to the action, stretcher bearers were increasingly acting as emergency medics rather than simply as carriers. They might be trained to apply Thomas splints, simple devices first used in the 1870s, but whose introduction as standard kit, transformed the prospects for those with major leg fractures.,And yet…. tens of thousands of Allied soldiers died in the assaults around Passchendaele. For all the broad improvements in treatment and logistics, the nature of this war ensured that it remained a daily medical catastrophe.,At home by November 1917, tremendous resources and facilities had also been given over to the further treatment, care and rehabilitation of the war wounded. A vast network of sites existed across the country. From austere military hospitals to grand suites in country houses, the state and the public were providing many thousands of beds. Sites for specialist treatment had also been established and were expanding both in size and in expertise, such as The Queen’s Hospital in Sidcup (for facial injuries) and Queen Mary’s Hospital in Roehampton (for amputees).,Wounded veterans were familiar sights in communities across Britain and many were also being retrained and brought back into the workforce. A good number even found themselves retrained into work that was directly associated with the results of wounding. Amputees might become limb-makers, the blind trained as masseurs and physiotherapists. With the war still raging, they continued to be a focus for extensive fundraising, and remained figures of both sympathy and respect.,However, some of those physically and mentally scarred by the war were already looking forward with fear and uncertainty as to how they might fare when peace returned. The government was also concerned, but for different reasons. With the likely final cost of veterans’ pensions escalating, officials would be accused of tightening the assessment of a veteran’s disability in order to save money in the longer term.,In the early years of peace, the wounded were to become inexorably linked with a symbol used to commemorate those who had not survived – the poppy. Following its introduction by the British Legion in 1921, the poppies for the following year were manufactured by a handful of disabled men based in a South London workshop. Within 10 years, over 350 disabled veterans were making them in what became known as the Poppy Factory. Veterans wounded in more recent conflicts continue to make them today."

race between him and his rivals to discern the structure
: Profs Ada Yonath in Germany and Israel, Thomas Steitz and Peter Moore at Yale University, and Harry Noller at the University of California, Santa Cruz.,The aim of the race was to map the million atoms in this ancient molecular machine to fathom the fundamentals of life, to provide new insights for the development of antibiotics, and claim a share of the Nobel Prize.,If this work were to be done today, said Venki, scientists would use an alternative to X-ray crystallography, called cryo-electron microscopy, which last year won
Richard Henderson
the Nobel Prize, underlining how Britain’s LMB is a veritable Nobel prize factory.,We met just a few days before the latest crop of Nobel Prizes and it became clear that Venki is uneasy about their corrupting influence. Moreover, when it comes to a Nobel, it can only be shared by three people, when modern science is a cooperative venture relying on much greater numbers of people.,In his book, it emerges that his wife, Vera, was nonplussed too. When she heard that Venki had won the Nobel Prize, she remarked: ‘I thought you had to be
really
smart to win one of those.’,The foreword of

IVF: 6 Million Babies Later
in Who Am I? until 25 November 2018.,Perhaps one of the most fascinating questions in Biology is how a single cell, the fertilized egg, gives rise to the complex myriad of cell and tissue types present in the adult organism, in an organized and timely manner.,By the late 1400s, Leonardo Da Vinci had already dissected a human fetus and concluded that embryos change in size and shape during development. But if we are to understand how these changes take place, and how they go awry in cases of miscarriage and pregnancy loss, we need to study human embryos.,Many centuries had to pass before
Bob Edwards
achieved a revolutionary scientific milestone: the fertilization and in vitro maturation of a human egg. This achievement opened the doors for the treatment of infertile couples, but it also gave scientists the opportunity to look at human embryos developing in vitro
for the first time in history
.,Upon fertilization, the human egg undergoes a series of divisions and changes in shape, culminating with the formation of an embryo, called the blastocyst, composed of approximately 200-300 cells on the 5th day of development. An embryo that reaches this stage is ready to implant into the maternal uterus, and, therefore, in
IVF clinics
embryos are transferred to the women’s uterus on day 5. But what happens to the embryo after implantation? 30% of human embryos fail to develop normally during the first post-implantation week. Yet, since the embryos are placed in the uterus, we cannot see them or study them to provide an answer. Could we find a way around it?,The starting point of our research was the hypothesis that
human embryos could develop beyond implantation
without the maternal uterus. At first this may seem unrealistic, but we already knew that mouse embryos could develop in a petri dish beyond the implantation point. And if mouse embryos could do it, why wouldn’t human embryos?,To perform these experiments we had to first seek approval from the Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority, as well as an independent ethical approval from a Research Ethics Committee. This legal framework allowed us to use surplus human embryos from IVF treatments, which were donated by couples that received informed consent.,In our daily routine we collect, manipulate and observe mouse embryos. Watching how they develop in perfect harmony is enchanting, but it definitely does not compare to the thrill and excitement that we experienced when we cultured the first human embryos beyond day 7, day 8, day 9… and all the way up to day 13. Not only did the embryos survive and grow, they also formed various post-implantation structures. We observed the formation of the amniotic cavity, which protects the developing embryo from damage; the appearance of specialized cells that build the placenta and communicate with the mother; and the formation of a rudimentary yolk sac, which provides nutrients.,But the excitement has just begun! We are now using this new method to understand why some embryos develop well and some others fail. We are particularly interested in understanding what happens when cells in the embryo do not have the right number of chromosomes, a phenomenon known as aneuploidy, as this is a major limitation for human reproduction. By studying human embryos that would otherwise be discarded we want to understand why so many human pregnancies fail, so we can hopefully conceive new strategies to fight infertility.,See

Western Front
. It was probably present at some of the biggest battles of the
First World War
between 1915 and 1918, including the Somme, Ypres (twice), Cambrai and Arras.,The Decca was the first portable gramophone assembled in England, launched in 1914 by Barnett Samuel and Sons Ltd.  Around 50,000 Decca instruments were made and many of them accompanied the troops in the trenches during the Great War; it was often referred to as the ‘Trench Decca’.,This gramophone travelled over 100 miles around the Western Front between 1915 and 1918. Soldiers wrote names of battles they fought in on the case and when they ran out of space they continued writing on the bowl inside.,,A bullet has passed through the bowl – which is unusually made of copper rather than the more common aluminium – but that clearly didn’t stop the troops using the gramophone and it even got a new cover afterwards.,When this gramophone arrived back to Britain, an article was written about it in trade magazine
The Talking Machine News
. In August 1918, the author admiringly states the war-honoured machine was still in full working order. Just a month earlier, Barnett Samuel and Sons Ltd had published an advertisement in the same magazine proudly quoting a letter from an enthusiastic soldier:,‘It was literally hit by a shell one day when playing in the mess and after we had recovered, we found the old gramophone still going strong! We had a new case made for it and it still survives though badly wounded.’,,When it retired from active service a century ago, the gramophone was donated to the Imperial War Museum where it went on display in an exhibition. The Decca was loaned to the Science Museum in 1964, with the Assistant Keeper of Physics writing at the time that, ‘It is a portable gramophone and could be carried without great difficulty by public transport’.,After some
conservation work
was completed, the gramophone went on display at the Science Museum in 1968 for the 50
th
anniversary of the end of the Great War.,I’ve recently had the chance to study this incredible object as part of preparations to move much of the
Science Museum Group Collection
from Blythe House in London to the
National Collections Centre
in Wiltshire.,,Handling the object I saw something on the cover that looked like dirt at first glance, but taking a closer look it resembled letters. It was hard to even see the black ink on the brown cover.,After chatting with my colleagues in the photography team, I decided to photograph the case and use photoshop to try and reveal the text.,Spending time with this object has made me wonder about the soldiers who used it. It is still hard to tell what was written on the case, but most likely it belonged to the Royal Engineers 75
th
Field Company which were part of the 16

(Irish) Division and present at the battles recorded on the gramophone.,"

2001: A Space Odyssey
for the first time. I’m glad, for it meant I could experience it properly for the first time on the Science Museum’s 60-foot IMAX screen.,I am not usually especially interested in a film’s special effects, but throughout watching
2001
I couldn’t help wondering , ‘how did they do that?’,One of the most visually impressive scenes of Stanley Kubrick’s 1968 masterpiece is the famous ‘Stargate Sequence’. This comes at the climax of the film (don’t worry, no spoilers). It is a visually stunning, psychedelic feast of colours. It feels as if you were experiencing a supernova through the hallucinating vision of an LSD-fuelled
Tim Leary
disciple.,﻿
Stanley Kubrick on the set of ‘2001: A Space Odyssey’. Credit: Warner Brothers,It came as a (welcome) surprise to discover Kubrick had turned to chemistry to create the ‘star gate’ effects.,As
Michael Benson
has revealed in a recent book on the making of the film, Kubrick began experimenting on what would become this scene in the unlikely setting of an abandoned brasserie factory in New York.,In the factory he and his team set up a series of square water tanks containing a mixture of black ink and a toxic WW2-era paint thinner called banana oil – isoamyl acetate, to chemists. Under incredibly-bright lights and cameras, Kubrick captured the dramatic reactions and colour changes produced when adding paints and various other chemicals to the tanks.,Christiane Kubrick, wife and collaborator of Stanley, recalls the factory experiments were ‘unspeakably disgusting’, as bacteria grew on the materials, causing a stench. Her husband would return home in the early hours, eyes red and swollen from the chemical fumes, to painstakingly record each chemical combination and the effect so it could be replicated.,Chemists also make use of a technique that involves water tanks and colours, known as thin-layer chromatography. Their purpose is to separate chemicals, rather than create cinematographic artistry. We have one of these tanks in our collection.,Kubrick had a background in photography, which had a profound influence on his meticulous filmmaking practice. As a student, he experimented with photochemical processes in a dark room – possibly formative experiences for the water tank techniques he deployed in
2001
, in collaboration with the special-effects guru
Douglas Trumbull
.,Chemistry is not a theme that crops up much in Kubrick films. But there is a notable example in probably my favourite, the wickedly-satirical Cold War comedy
Dr. Strangelove
(1964).,Without giving too much away, the psychotically-paranoid General Jack D. Ripper responsible for sparking the nuclear crisis of the film is driven by a belief that America is being poisoned by communists.,The method of poison? Fluoride in the water. Chewing on a cigar, Ripper exclaims ‘fluoridation is the most monstrously conceived and dangerous communist plot we have ever had to face’.,Fluoride, a staple of toothpastes, had been introduced to US water supplies just after the Second World War (and some UK water from 1964) to combat tooth decay. However, it was largely left-wing liberals, rather than communist-fearing military generals, who opposed its introduction.,Over half of America drinks fluoridated water today. The public debate about its consequences for health remains, though convincing evidence supporting its risks has yet to surface.,For now, if you’re heading to the IMAX Theatre to catch the film, fortify your gnashers with some popcorn while you enjoy the chemical mastery of Kubrick’s
2001: A Space Odyssey

","Collections and Objects,Exhibitions and Galleries","chemistry,materials,photography,plastics,science museum group","Bakelite
changed the world in the first half of the twentieth century.,Advertised with the slogan ‘The material of 1000 uses’ Bakelite was the first synthetic plastic and heralded an age in which we were no longer dependent on the products of nature.,Bakelite’s legacy is a world where synthetic plastics surround us: from medical implants to space shuttles, we have now become dependent on these synthetic materials.,On 7 December 1909, the United States Patent and Trademark Office granted the Belgian-born chemist Leo Baekeland a patent for a “Method of making insoluble products of phenol and formaldehyde”.,Hard, compact, insoluble and infusible this was the first synthetic plastic. Named Bakelite after its inventor.,Leo Baekeland moved from Europe to the United States, starting life in America working for a photographic firm.,An able chemist and innovator, Baekeland developed his own photographic paper and started a manufacturing base to produce Velox paper, the first commercially successful photographic paper. In 1899, Baekeland and his business partners sold their company, Nepera, to George Eastman of the Eastman Kodak Co. for $750,000.,Now extremely wealthy, Baekeland set up a well-equipped research laboratory in the comfort of his own home. As part of the sale agreement with Kodak, Baekeland had agreed not to development any more photographic technology; he would need a new area of research.,As he had done with Velox, Baekeland looked for a problem that offered “the best chance for the quickest possible results.” Asked why he entered the field of synthetic resins, Baekeland answered that his intention was to make even more money.,By the 1900s, chemists had begun to recognise the potential of natural resins and fibres, but attempts to replicate these in laboratory settings had been unsuccessful.,Baekeland familiarised himself with previous work and performed his research in a systematic and well documented fashion, carefully controlling and varying the effects of temperature, pressure and the types and proportions of phenol and formaldehyde.,The production of polyoxybenzylmethylenglycolanhydride was the answer to Baekeland’s dreams. With the slightly catchier named of Bakelite, the resin is combined with fillers, such as wood and asbestos before it’s pressed directly into the required final shape.,A multitude of different uses
were found for this new material and Baekeland’s legacy can be seen across the
Science Museum Group Collection
.,One of the most iconic is the
Bakelite phone
:,Equally collectable today is the
Bakelite radio
:,Lesser-known applications were
coffins
and
medical training equipment
.,This
Cigarette box
from the 1930s, is an imitation of much more expensive imported wooden boxes, showing a horseman spearing a lion in the Assyrian style fashionable in the interwar period.,Baekeland’s process patent for making insoluble products of phenol and formaldehyde was filed in July 1907, and granted 108 years ago on 7 December 1909.,At the time of Baekeland’s death in 1944, the world production of Bakelite has been estimated at around 175,000 tons; it was used in over 15,000 different products.,Today, we grappled with the controversies of how to cope with a world full of plastics; perhaps we can learn something from the history of their development and use?"

HLF Conservation Intern, Matt Walker, talks us through the process of repairing one such object.","Collections and Objects,Exhibitions and Galleries","conservation,exploration,medicine","Over the past year I have worked as a conservator on the Science Museum’s upcoming
Medicine Galleries
, due to open in 2019.,One object that has been a privilege to work on is
a medical kit used by the British explorer Ernest Shackleton
(1874-1922) during his 1907-1909 attempt to reach the South Pole.,Although unsuccessful, Shackleton’s team did set a record for the southernmost point reached, and were able to map some of the area. Shackleton returned to Britain a public hero and was Knighted for his achievements.,The medical kit was made by Burroughs & Wellcome Co. and consists of a thermometer, bandages, plasters, safety pins, a tube of Hazeline cream, and sewing needles all held within a leather wallet.,There are also sixteen tubes containing various medicines and tablets of the day. In a bid of advertising genius,
Henry Wellcome
donated his company’s medicine chests to various expeditions with the hope they would donate them back to his burgeoning history of medicine collections.,The aims for conservation were to document, clean, repair and stabilise the medical kit so that it’s fit for long term display.,The leather wallet was in poor condition and presented the biggest conservation challenges. The leather had deteriorated, a phenomenon known as red-rot, causing it to crumble and become powdery. It was also torn in several places.,I applied a weak consolidant called Klucel G over the leather surface to hold any loose fragments on to the wallet surface and prevent future shedding. Klucel G had the advantage that it did not discolour or alter the surface appearance, and still retained the natural flexibility of the leather.,Where larger areas of leather had crumbled or torn I adhered pieces of dyed Japanese tissue on the reverse side of the wallet for support and to prevent pieces detaching in the future.,The three flaps that covered the medicine tubes had fully torn off (a fourth flap is missing). To reattach the flaps I created a hinge from strips of dyed Reemay fabric. Strips were adhered between the two halves of each flap, and the ends of the strips attached discretely to the wallet.,The strips were coated with an adhesive and allowed to dry before the ends were adhered to the wallet by heat activation of the adhesive using a heat spatula. Using heat meant a stronger bond could be produced, and done so more quickly compared with applying the adhesive on wet and waiting for it to set.,The flaps are now securely attached and can be opened and closed as originally intended.,There were also two large tears in the expandable sides of the middle pocket. As these will not be visible under the open flaps of the wallet on display I felt that a full repair was unnecessary.,Instead I found a simple solution by wrapping a strip of transparent tape around the wallet, under the medicine tubes and through the gaps between the strips attaching the flaps on each side, with double sided adhesive tape to hold the ends together.,The two sides of the pocket are now held together, enclosing the contents and allowing the front face of the pocket to rest in a more natural position.,I found treating Shackleton’s medical kit both an interesting and rewarding experience. While it still bears many scars from the expedition it is now in a much more stable condition and will hopefully interest people for years to come. I can’t wait to see it on display.,The Science Museum Medicine Galleries are due to open in 2019."

Medicine Galleries
.,Since joining the Medicine team in September 2017, we have already worked on hundreds of objects. These have ranged in materials from plastic spectacles, ceramic and glass medical jars to ivory dentures and horn pipes. The age of objects spans widely, from Roman lancets to modern day e-cigarette machines. Some objects have travelled to Antarctica on expeditions, some are worn during traditional medical rituals in Sri Lanka, and some are part of contemporary medicine. The variety of objects really is incredible!,Most of our time is spent condition assessing, which is done to ensure that every object going on display is in a stable state. This process involves inspecting each object, evaluating its physical and chemical stability, and intervening when necessary.,What we look for ranges from surface dirt and accretions to deteriorating materials (such as corroding metal or powdery leather), unstable surfaces (such as flaking paint or cracked glass), detached fragments and old repairs. What we uncover determines the type of treatment we complete.,We use specialised techniques and reversible materials to complete treatments. This ensures everyone can discern our treatment from the original object and allows for the safe removal of the materials we have introduced. The following are a few examples…,Half-way through surface cleaning a stone mortar. European 1800-1950.,Before and after of Medicine chest used by Captain Scott, made by Burroughs Wellcome & Co, supplied to the British Antarctic Expedition 1910,Before and after of a portable pocket face mask in blue plastic container c.2000,Cracks are stabilised to prevent the damage from worsening, as well as to ensure the object is safe for handling, packing and transport.,Before and after of a model alligator made of resin and wood.

If there are gaps along the join edges, we fill these to support the fragments in situ.,Before and after conservation of a Pharmacy vase 16th – 17th century.,Occasionally we improve the appearance of old repairs that have aged poorly. Our main concern is that old repairs remain stable and don’t further deteriorate, but sometimes visual changes such as severe yellowing become a distraction.,Surface cleaning, re-adhering fragments, filling and painting this votive plaque tin glazed earthenware. Italian 1650-1750.,The treatments frequently involve a combination of the above steps. We select techniques that allow us to maintain and interpret the historical, spiritual and aesthetical values."

James Watt
for his separate condenser.,The patent was titled ‘A new method of lessening the consumption of steam and fuel in fire-engines’ and is now regarded as one of the most significant patents ever granted in the UK.,Watt’s separate condenser was the greatest single improvement ever made to the steam engine.,The condenser vastly improved efficiency. Steam engines with Watt’s condenser burned 2/3rds less coal, making them capable of working not just on mines but in factories, mills, workshops, and anywhere else that needed power.,The separate condenser resolved the engine’s fundamental problem, that for maximum fuel economy the steam cylinder had to stay as hot as possible, while for maximum thermal efficiency it should be cooled once per working cycle.,By condensing the steam in a separate condenser kept permanently cool, both fuel economy and efficient use of heat were maximised.,Taking this concept and transforming it into an industrial machine took Watt years of hard work, leaving behind a collection of models which remain in the
Science Museum Group Collection
.,What was
long claimed to be the first model of the condenser
, dating from 1765, is displayed in our
Making the Modern World gallery
.,However, the true identity of the first model was only established in the 1960s by museum curator Rodney Law, who realised that the first model had in fact been concealed, un-noticed, among other items laying on a workbench in
Watt’s workshop
, also
in the Science Museum
.,John Robison saw this model within a few days of it being made. He later wrote:,‘I came into Mr Watt’s parlour… and found him sitting before the fire, having lying on his knee a little tin cistern, which he was looking at. I entered into conversation… about steam.
All the while Mr Watt kept looking at the fire, and laid down the cistern at the foot of his chair.,At last he looked at me, and said briskly, “You need not fash yourself about that, man; I have now made an engine that shall not waste a particle of steam.” So saying, Mr Watt looked with complacency at the little thing at his feet, and seeing that I observed him, he shoved it away under a table…’,It may only be a ‘little tin cistern’, but this modest object led to a series of events that transformed the world, and is one of the most important items in the national collection."

inaugural run in February 2016
.,And Sir Ian himself curated an exhibition to celebrate the career of the world’s greatest railway artist,
Terence Cuneo
, as part of Hull UK City of Culture 2017.,Sir Ian says that the work of the Science Museum Group is rightly celebrated because its collections of seven million items rests on remarkable foundations, the nation’s key role in the rise of science, from the industrial revolution to astonishingly creative individuals such as Isaac Newton and Ada Lovelace, to the discovery of the single atom thick wonder material graphene (celebrated at a recent exhibition at the Science and Industry Museum).,Britain has an amazing story to tell about its contribution to world science. For Sir Ian, who talks much about ‘inspiring futures’, this story of the power of rational thinking must be taken to the young people who will change our world in decades to come.,With the biggest informal learning effort of its kind in Europe, the museum group he leads now attracts more than 600,000 children in booked educational groups. It has also pioneered the next generation of interactive galleries in its Wonderlabs in London and Bradford. Sir Ian likes to talk of ‘dumbing up’ – museums can ignite curiosity about science, technology, engineering and mathematics.,Sir Ian’s ambitions are global; he feels it is more important than ever before to engage with new allies as much as re-engage with his old friends. “We, and Britain’s wider museum sector, are rightly celebrated as unique and powerful players in cultural diplomacy,’ says Sir Ian, who, as the most experienced current director of a national museum, and former Deputy Director of the V&A, is also the Chair of the powerful National Museum Directors’ Council.,The Group of museums that he oversees – five, including the Science Museum, reaching an annual audience of more than five million – supported a recent report by the think tank ResPublica, entitled
Britain’s Global Future: Harnessing the soft power capital of UK institutions
. “Culture is a powerful bridge between nations,’ he says, ‘and Britain is fantastically placed to use it to create global impact, both in terms of its individual talent pool and its wealth of great institutions.’,Sir Ian, who has a background in the history of art, walks the walk as well as talking the internationalist talk. The Group has strong cultural bonds with Russia, through its current Last Tsar exhibition, the UK–Russia Year of Science and the museum’s ground-breaking Cosmonauts exhibition which began in London and closed in Moscow after a long run and rave reviews.,For his efforts, Sir Ian received the Pushkin Medal, the nation’s highest cultural honour, from Russian President Vladimir Putin – you can see a virtual version of the

Louise’s parents had spent ten years trying to conceive before they were treated using the in vitro fertilisation (IVF) technique developed by British researchers Robert Edwards and Patrick Steptoe. Robert Edwards first achieved fertilisation with human eggs in 1968, although it took a further decade before Louise was born. During this time, Patrick Steptoe perfected a method for obtaining human eggs from the ovaries by keyhole surgery, using a laparoscope. With Edwards and Steptoe working together, eggs were removed from the mother, fertilised in a culture dish (a process known as in vitro) and then reintroduced into the womb a few days later. While in vitro this glass incubator was used to keep the embryos at body temperature as they developed inside. Since Louise’s birth over 5 million babies have been born thanks to IVF techniques. Robert Edwards was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2010 for his work on IVF.,Birthday Fun Fact:

:,Dwayne,
Explainer,,“I studied Anthropology at university with a focus on learning and development; as such I love seeing how people absorb and decode knowledge and there is no better place to see this in practice than at the Science Museum. The Light Table is my favourite object to
interact with visitors over because light is something that is literally all around us, and vital for so many things. Through setting up different displays of light I like prompting our visitors to think about how light affects them and its place not just in scientific experiments but in our everyday lives.”,Wonderlab: The Equinor Gallery
is the UK’s biggest interactive science gallery. The permanent gallery features unique exhibits, specially-commissioned artworks, explosive demonstrations and immersive experiences led by the Museum’s talented team of science communicators, Explainers, to inspire visitors of all ages to wonder at the science and mathematics that shape our lives. With over 50 exhibits across seven zones (including the
Light
zone) visitors to the gallery will explore the incredible phenomena that occur around us every day, with topics as diverse as sound, forces, light, electricity, maths, matter and space.
Wonderlab
is also home to three live demonstration areas and a 120-capacity showspace inspired by the Royal Institution’s world-renowned Faraday Theatre.,Birthday Fun Fact:
The first
‘Children’s Gallery’
in the museum opened in December 1931. It aimed to stimulate the curiosity of children, and included a large number of working models. ‘I was one of the first visitors to the original Children’s Gallery, which opened back in 1931, and can still remember the wonderful door that opened before I had even reached it.’ – Sir David Attenborough.,Vickers Vimy Aircraft, 1919, from
Flight
:,Ben
, PhD Researcher in Conservation,,“The Vickers Vimy aircraft is my favourite object as it represents such a great human achievement. It made the first non-stop flight over the Atlantic Ocean in 1919, a journey that is now routine but was then incredibly dangerous. For my PhD research I am studying how to conserve this plane and others like it. As it gets older the fabric covering over the wings tears, and I’ve been investigating how this can best be prevented and repaired to keep the planes safe for future generations.”,The Vickers Vimy aircraft was used by John Alcock and Arthur Whitten Brown to make the first non-stop flight across the Atlantic. In 1913 Lord Northcliffe, proprietor of the Daily Mail, offered a prize of £10,000 to the first aviator to cross the North Atlantic. The outbreak of the First World War intervened but attempts resumed in 1919. The Vimy had been designed in 1917 as a heavy bomber. Its great asset for the Atlantic attempt was its two Rolls-Royce Eagle engines – probably the most reliable aero engines then made. In June 1919 it left St.John’s, Newfoundland before landing in Clifden, Co.Galway after a perilous flight across the Atlantic. For this arduous journey the Vimy had been specially constructed to perform the flight, as additional fuel tanks were added to it in order to extend the range it could travel. Later Alcock and Whitten Brown were awarded KBE’s in recognition of their skill and bravery.,Birthday Fun Fact:
The

Volunteer,,“I studied Health & Human Sciences at university and have always found the history behind attitudes towards mental health fascinating. This led to me working on Wounded: Conflict, Casualties and Care. I got to research the history of medicine and discovered the instruments used to treat ‘shell-shocked’ soldiers like the blood circulator by Dr Macaura. While it was originally invented as a tool to help hysterical women relax it was later used on soldiers to ease their pain. Doctors at the time thought the best option for healing soldiers was through physical treatment as psychological damage wasn’t understood in the way it is now. Instruments like this object marked a real change in how scientists and doctors helped people suffering from trauma.”,Two thousand vibrations per minute are produced by cranking the handle of this massager, which was applied to the body. Advertised as a blood circulator, the massager was claimed to cure pain, deafness, anaemia, heart disease, cramp, polio and ‘women’s problems’. It was invented by Gerald Joseph Macaura and thousands of the devices were made with this example being produced by British Appliances Manufacturing Co, based in Leeds, England. During the war makers of this vibrating massager advertised directly to discharged soldiers. They claimed their device could relieve pain, and stimulate paralysed muscles and vocal chords.,Birthday Fun Fact:

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/creating-little-eric/,a guest author,Creating Little Eric,A volunteer at the Science Museum has created his own mini version of Eric the UK's first robot. ,Exhibitions and Galleries,"robots,Science Museum,technology,volunteers","Robin Hiley is a volunteer at the Science Museum. Recently he was inspired by
Eric
– one of the key automatons in our
Robots
exhibition – to create his own mini version of Eric which looks and moves just like his larger counter-part.,Before the
Robots
exhibition opened back in February I joined a small team of volunteers working on producing ideas for object handling in the exhibition. This inspired me to make an automaton of my own – but what to make? Maybe toy horses that could race each other – or perhaps a beautiful mechanical flower that would open of its own accord. When I saw artist Giles Walker’s restored replica of Eric my decision was made. The Eric on display in
Robots
is a modern recreation of the UK’s first robot and was rebuilt by Giles with help from a
Kickstarter campaign
.,My resources are nowhere near the scale of Giles’s workshop, but I have built several 3D printers and thought I could use this technology to render something similar. I therefore planned a much smaller version, Little Eric, with a 3D printed skeleton, an Arduino microcontroller for a ‘brain’ and stepping motors for the movements.,I designed the skeleton parts using CAD (Computer Aided Design) then printed them in PLA (polylactic acid) plastic. I can’t claim to have got them all perfect the first time and there was a lot of prototyping (aka trial and error), but gradually Little Eric took shape. Several of the other volunteers helped me out with ideas and advice. Part of what makes being a Science Museum volunteer so much fun is the support and encouragement everyone gives each other.,The trickiest part was the standing mechanism. After some experiments I connected a fairly large stepping motor onto a shaft (all hidden in the wooden box you can see above), then drove the knee and hip joints from the shaft with toothed belts. You can print gears and belt sprockets quite easily using a 3D printer. At this stage I hadn’t designed his upper parts, so I estimated their weight and trialled loading the standing mechanism to make sure it would produce enough force for Eric to stand.,I like recycling materials where I can. Eric’s arms are driven by motors salvaged from old DVD drives, and the linkages to them are made from a length of titanium wire I found on a beach. I tried to make his ‘skin’ from old drink cans, but the aluminium used in these turned out to be too stiff and instead I used a more malleable material.,Little Eric has no voice yet, but I’m working on it…….,There are just 4 weeks left to see

Science Museum Group Academy
, with Founding Partner BP.  The Academy is the brand new home for our science engagement training for educators, STEM and museum/science centre professionals.,The first
science engagement
courses delivered in our new Academy classroom took place last month for both primary and secondary school teachers. This course shares our creative approach and philosophy – focusing on different hands-on
activities
that teachers can use in the classroom to engage their students.,Throughout the day teachers experience the techniques for themselves and reflect on how they can implement the ideas in their own classrooms, helping pupils to make personal connections with science, both in school and in their everyday lives.,All of our courses are underpinned by academic research around science engagement and in particular
science capital
. We integrate the
principles of good practice
from the research into all our courses, both by discussing the theory, and trying out practical activities to demonstrate how they can be used in school.,For example, one activity called
Powerful Questions
encourages teachers to generate questions or statements that link students’ interests and experiences with the science concepts they want to teach.,This approach shows the value of considering their students’ interests, knowledge and experiences in finding ways to make the science content they teach meaningful and relevant. Their powerful questions provide an effective way to get students to start thinking and talking about science, while casually reinforcing that there is a scientific aspect to many of their interests.,We generated some great powerful questions in these first courses, including
‘Harry Potter: boy wizard or scientist?’
and
‘Which of your senses is most important when playing Fortnite?’.,The energy in the room during these courses was really positive as teachers wondered, explored, discussed ideas – and really enjoyed themselves in the process.,We had some brilliant responses to our activities and everyone shared their experiences and ideas, inspiring each other as well as us.,One teacher commented on how ‘supportive and not intimidating’ the course had been, and another said how great it was that our resources use ‘every day materials and equipment which made them cheap and easy’ to put in to practice. Overall the feedback was great, with possibly the most rewarding comment being that it had ‘reminded me why we teach children science’.,Our next Academy courses at the Science Museum are happening in January and we’ll also be delivering training at the
Science and Industry Museum
in Manchester from February. We can’t wait to meet our next groups of teachers and hopefully inspire them to engage all their students with the wonders of STEM.,Find out more about our upcoming science engagement courses

recent exhibition
.,Sally Cheshire, CBE, chair of the HFEA, said that the origins of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act still forms the basis of the framework by which the UK regulates patient treatment and human embryo research, even though its origins date back to 1990.,During the five months that the 40th anniversary of In Vitro Fertilisation was marked by the Science Museum, including a
celebration of Louise Brown’s birthday
, it is estimated that around 180,000 visitors saw the exhibition,
IVF: 6 Million Babies Later
.,Speaking at the Progress Educational Trust’s Annual Conference, held at Amnesty International in London,
Sally Cheshire said
: ‘The Science Museum exhibition I opened in July this year to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Louise Brown’s birth was called
6 Million Babies Later
and, its estimated that by the end of this century, 400 million babies or 3% of the global population could exist by virtue of IVF babies and their descendants. We live in a world which the HFE Act could never have predicted.’,She acknowledged that
advances
such as mitochondrial donation,
growing embryos for longer than ever before in the laboratory
,
artificial embryos
,
genome editing
and more were pushing back the boundaries but was ‘not yet convinced’ that the HFE Act has to change, such as by modifying the rule that embryos should not be grown for more than 14 days in the lab, which rests on the work of
Baroness Mary Warnock
, who in 1984 led a committee which explored the borderlands that lie between acceptable and unacceptable research on the human embryo.,At a session chaired by Roger Highfield, Director of External Affairs of the Science Museum Group, advances in fertility science were discussed by Dr Evan Harris, the former MP who scrutinised the HFE Act 2008; Dr Andy Greenfield, Principal Investigator and Programme Leader in Mammalian Sexual Development at the Medical Research Council Harwell Institute’s research centre; and Dr Kathy Niakan, Group Leader of the Francis Crick Institute’s Human Embryo and Stem Cell Laboratory, the first researcher licensed by the HFEA to edit the genomes of human embryos.,Genome editing
dominated headlines around the world the week of the conference when He Jiankui of Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen claimed to have created the world’s first genome-edited babies in an attempt to confer resistance to HIV, the AIDS virus.,Dr Niakan said
that the development was concerning, and, if confirmed, would mark an irresponsible, unethical and dangerous use of genome editing technology. ‘In the UK, it is rightly illegal to establish a pregnancy from a genome-edited embryo. Given the significant doubts about safety, including the
potential for unintended harmful side-effects
, it is simply far too premature to attempt this.’,She also pointed out that ‘…the sparse technical details suggested that there does seem to have been a genetic change in these infants but it fell short of the precision that one would expect from genome editing. Moreover, creating “genomic immunity” to HIV infection was a weak justification for genome editing because there are still too many unknowns concerning the technology and human embryonic development.’,Dr Andy Greenfield
attended the International Summit on Human Genome Editing
where the controversial work was unveiled. He said: ‘There was an electricity in the auditorium unlike anything I have experienced in my scientific career…. I sensed so many apparent contradictions. He (He Jiankui) did not once admit any wrongdoing; he carefully explained what he had done and why. His aim had been to generate humans with an altered version of a particular protein, CCR5, which if disrupted would confer immunity to HIV infection.’,Dr He had, he believed, followed appropriate protocols in obtaining informed consent from the parents. ‘He had also sought and was given appropriate institutional authority to proceed – but neither of these statements convinced many in the audience,’ said Dr Greenfield.,Many questions remain, not least the need to independently verify the data that He Jiankui  presented, whilst protecting the identity of the children. As yet, the data have not appeared in a peer-reviewed journal.,The panel was also concerned by the impact of the announcement in terms of public confidence. Dr Harris said that ‘…it is important to keep pushing for progress. If we don’t talk about issues for fear of controversy the only voices being heard will be those seeking to restrict or ban.’,Sarah Norcross, Director of the Progress Educational Trust, said the news was shocking on many levels. ‘First, we would have expected to see a lot more research into the safety and efficacy of genome editing in human embryos, before attempting to achieve a pregnancy. Second, we would have expected the first such application of genome editing to be on an embryo which had a serious genetic condition with life-limiting consequences. Given our current level of knowledge, editing the genomes of healthy embryos to attempt to confer resistance to HIV is completely unethical.’,A more accurate kind of genome editing, unveiled in 2012, exploits a mechanism used as a defence against viral attack by the bacterium
Streptococcus pyogenes
. It is known as CRISPR mutagenesis, an acronym that comes from the repetitive DNA sequences (‘clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats’) that form the bacterium’s immune system with a set of enzymes called Cas (CRISPR-associated proteins) that, guided by RNAs copied from invading viruses, can cleave the invading viral DNA to stop the viruses from replicating."

DNA
from our parents is shuffled and mutated to make us all individual is published today.,The work shows how the cellular machinery that allows human populations to adapt to new environments carries a heavy price for a few people who suffer mutations that lead to serious genetic disease.,We are all individual because of the novel patchworks of genetic codes we inherit from our parents, with a few novelties thrown in as a result of mistakes.,Today, new details of this process are laid bare because of a remarkable database of DNA information from the Icelandic population, published in the journal
Science
.,The analysis reveals how men and women contribute differently to diversity, through a process called crossover recombination, and shows how the mutational roots of rare disease are a side effect of the mechanism that allows us to generate new versions of the human genetic code, so that everyone is different.,‘We have done this both because it is of fundamental interest to understand more about who we are as a species, and because here in Iceland we have unique resources to address these questions,’ said Dr Kari Stefansson, CEO of
deCODE genetics
in Reykjavik, Iceland, a subsidiary of Amgen, and last author of the paper. ‘We want to understand the raw material for evolution and selection.’,The analysis by Dr Stefansson, Bjarni Halldorsson and colleagues provides the most detailed view to date of the location, rate and connection between these two key drivers of human evolution: recombination – the reshuffling of the genome that occurs when a special kind of cell division (meiosis) forms eggs and sperm; and new (
de novo
) mutation – the appearance in every one of our genomes of dozens of usually small variations that we did not inherit from either of our parents.,Today’s study draws on DNA sequence data from some 150,000 Icelanders from multiple generations, comprising nearly half the population and yielding the precise location of 4.5 million crossover recombinations and more than 200,000 de novo mutations.,To drill down into the details, they studied 126,000 meioses in mother-father-child trios, and did even more precise detection of
de novo
variations using the whole genome sequence of 28,000 people.,Mutations – spelling mistakes – in the DNA code are linked with evolution but, said Dr Stefansson, ‘we see here, in great detail, how this process is in fact systematically regulated – by the genome itself and by the fact that recombination and
de novo
mutation are linked.’,The study shows 35 variations in DNA sequence that affect recombination rate and location, and that de novo mutations are more than fifty times more likely nearby recombination sites where DNA has been shuffled between parents than elsewhere in the genome. This is ‘dramatic’, said Dr Stefansson.,Furthermore, women contribute far more to recombination, while men contribute more to de novo mutation. The latter is a major source of rare diseases of childhood. ‘Children conceived to a 40-year-old father have twice the
de novo
mutation than those of a 20-year-old,’ he said.,It is important to put this in context – most of these mutations are harmless – but it does show that an ‘astonishing number of rare genetic diseases early in childhood are from
de novo
mutations arising in the father.’,‘What we see here is that the genome is an engine for generating diversity within certain bounds,’ Dr Stefansson concluded. ‘This is clearly beneficial to the success of our species but at great cost to some individuals with rare diseases, which are therefore a collective responsibility we must strive to address.’"

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/future-technologies-in-music/,Chris Bell,Future Technologies in Music,A panel chaired by Jarvis Cocker discussed the advancing technology in music and where artificial intelligence might lead us. Chris Bell explores more.,At the Museum,"AI,imax,lates,music and sound,vip events","On Wednesday 30 January, the Science Museum welcomed an esteemed panel of musicians, artists and technologists to the IMAX Theatre for a discussion chaired by former Pulp frontman and all-round musical icon Jarvis Cocker, to discuss the many possible futures for music. With technology advancing at an ever-increasing pace, where might things like Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning lead us? And with ever more sophisticated means by which to measure the human body’s physical state, how might these be utilised to create the optimum sonic experience?,The discussion centred around
Ecstatic Data Sets: The Apeiron Chorismos Scanner
, newly published on Rough Trade Books and authored by panelist Sam Potter of cult band Late of the Pier. Joining him were two of the technologists whose work directly influenced the book, music producer and ex-NASA scientist Dr Kelly Snook, adaptive/algorithmic composer Robert Thomas, and artist Hannah Peel, whose studies into the effects of music on dementia patients were the inspiration for her 2016 album
Awake but Always Dreaming
.,Ecstatic Data Sets
is a pamphlet containing a speculative design for an imagined machine that “listens” to the user, taking detailed measurements of the body’s functions and neural activity, to provide a tailored soundtrack to elevate the user’s mood and alleviate “adverse” states of mind such as anxiety or paranoia. Access to a cloud-based store of archive music and machine learning-enabled composition-on-the-fly allow it to provide the user with a sort of musically-assisted mental equilibrium. With increased regular use by a great enough number of people, it can eventually work out how to stimulate states of ecstasy – tapping into its
ecstatic data sets
.,The proposed machine doesn’t yet exist in real-life, but as the pamphlet assures us, the technology for it does; and the likes of Robert Thomas, Dr Kelly Snook and Hannah Peel are amongst those working at the forefront of the technology and ideas that inspire the speculative design. So exactly how close are we to having a device like the Apeiron Chorismos Scanner?,As Robert Thomas discusses, there are numerous examples of this technology already. The Hear and Now mindful breathing app, developed in part with Thomas, monitors the user’s heart rate during meditation – the algorithmically-generated music will adapt to the user and create a different arrangement to direct them towards a meditative state. There are even, apparently, ways to cheat the system by imagining the music that might bring about this state; ‘What it does is set a feedback loop between you and the system so you’re affecting the music; that moves the music to a different position, and because the music has an emotional effect on you, it goes around’. Thomas has also produced algorithmic music for a similar meditation app which, rather than measuring heart rate via a wristband, uses an EEG headset to assess the meditative state.,Artificial Intelligence in music, meanwhile, is all the rage these days. Nick Cave might have recently proclaimed that ‘
an AI will never write a great song
‘, but you can bet your bottom dollar they won’t stop trying. One could make a compelling case that machine learning already has its fingerprints on mainstream listening habits, with Spotify’s recommended tracks based on subscribers’ prior listening, and on the cutting edge of AI-generated music, companies like Australian startup
Popgun
are ‘using Deep Learning to develop an Artificial Intelligence to create awesome pop songs’.,More recently Siri co-founder Tom Gruber announced his new venture LifeScore, a new AI with the potential to conjure up musical compositions based on the behaviours and actions of listeners, from how they’re feeling to the pace that they walk. Not unlike the Apeiron Chorismos Scanner.,The quest to create autonomous music isn’t a new one of course. In 1987 David Cope developed Experiments in Music Intelligence, or “Emi”, a programme capable of reading music in the form of musical code. Fed any number of classical compositions, Emi could then regurgitate a new composition based on the scores it had previously read. Go even further back and you find the mechanical music boxes of 19th century European clockmakers, or the autonomous Flute Player built by Jacques de Vaucanson in 1738. Heck, you have to rewind all the way to 9th Century Baghdad to find the earliest example of a mechanical musical instrument – the hydropower organ invented by the Banu Musa brothers and described in their
Book of Ingenious Devices
.,So, we’ve been thinking about autonomous music for literally millennia, and for time immemorial striving to create machines and software that can play something for us to listen to. The intriguing thing now – as Jarvis and co uncover in their fascinating discussion – is that we’re on the cusp of making machine music that listens to
us

Chinese incense clocks
!,,Chinese incense clocks have three main uses; practical, recreational and religious.,Practically, a clock needs to be able to tell the time.,This can be done through sound, sight, touch or smell. There are early records of incense clocks being used in China from 1073AD, where a severe drought in the countryside caused many municipal clepsydrae to stop working.,This solution replaced water with fire in the form of the “Hundred Gradations Incense seal”, a public incense clock which could burn for up to 100 nights.,Recreationally, powdered incense clocks were mainly used in China as personalised and portable time-keeping devices for homes.,Metal (nickel, silver, pewter) versions were lighter and smaller than their wood and stone predecessors and therefore became a popular gift used by Chinese scholars and intellectuals.,Incense smoke would waft through the grate and would strengthen and change over time stirring the emotions of scholars. These gift incense clocks would often overtly feature Chinese symbols of growth and prosperity.,,This example
from the Science Museum Group Collection features the Chinese “double happiness” character, shuāng xǐ (囍), as part of the latticework. Shuāng xǐ (囍) is a widely used Chinese character which represents love, marriage and literally “happiness”.,Other featured characters could be Fú (福), meaning good fortune, or chūn (春) both characters heavily associated with Chinese spring festival and a way of adding a personal touch to the gifted clock.,Incense seals, sticks and spirals were also used for religious time telling, keeping the time during festivals and important rituals. Incense spirals were given notches in order to keep track of time, and though incense is still a common feature in East Asian temples they now primarily feature as votives rather than time measurement instruments.,Find out more about how this smoky signaller works in this episode of

Spotting shapes in the sky is fun, especially on a sunny day. The amateur meteorologist
Luke Howard
looked up and classified these wisps of white, changing the course of meteorology forever.,Luke Howard had been inspired by nature from a young age. Born  today (21 March) in London in 1772 Howard developed his childhood passion and became an amateur meteorologist. He even built a laboratory at his home filled with instruments to analyse the weather. Even though his day job was manufacturing chemicals for the pharmaceutical industry, Howard’s scientific work changed the way we understand the climate around us.,Before the 19
th
century, many meteorologists thought of each cloud as unique, unclassifiable and in a state of temporary existence. Instead of strict descriptions clouds were recorded by colour or individual interpretation.,This all changed when Howard presented his
Essay on the Modification of Clouds
to the Askesian Society in 1802. The impact of this work was immense, elevating the natural phenomenon to the realms of worthy scientific investigation.,Founded in detailed observations, with a pinch of imagination, these cloud types were; cumulus, Latin for ‘heap’; stratus, Latin for ‘layer’, and cirrus, Latin for ‘curl of hair’. Words we still use today.,Luke Howard captured these transient phenomena in delicate, though scientifically scrutinised sketches.,The Science Museum Group has a
rich collection
of these images in a range of medium from pencil to watercolours, with some on display in our
Making the Modern World gallery
.,It has been argued by historians of art and science that Howard’s contemporary
John Constable
was
influenced by this new meteorological theory and visible in his powerful landscapes.,Not only did Howard’s images inspire great art but so did his published essays which stimulated the imaginations of the poets Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Percy Shelly.,Even though Luke Howard was only an amateur meteorologist he believed strongly that developments in science depended on accurate data gathering.,By taking daily observations of temperature, rainfall, atmospheric pressure and wind direction from his home in Tottenham, Howard became one of the first pioneers of urban climate studies.,He published the first two volumes of
The Climate of London
deduced from Meteorological Observations at different places in the Neighbourhood of the Metropolis
in 1818 and 1820, followed by an extensive
second edition
in 1833.,Howard noted the changes in weather religiously for over 30 years recording his results in tables and innovative graphics.,Discover more about Luke Howard’s sketches in this film:,"

until 24 July.),The novel was inspired by two things: a science fiction short story warning of climate change that was written on Antarctica in 1911 by a polar explorer and atmospheric scientist called
George Clarke Simpson
, and secondly by silent black and white film of Antarctica, shot during Sir Ernest Shackleton’s heroic expedition of 1914-16; the first moving images of Antarctica that most people at the time had ever seen.,My novel fuses these ideas to tell a new story about Emily and her daughter Jenny, climate change refugees who are fleeing to Antarctica instead of from it as Shackleton had done, in a hot world rather than a cold one, but a world in which the Shackleton story has become a founding myth of the new continent, much as the story of Christopher Columbus gave symbolic value to historical migration to the United States of America.,I wanted to try and communicate some of these ideas in the
Shackleton’s Man Goes South
logo, so I approached leading British designer Jake Tilson, who is well known for his work with the likes of Ian Dury and the Blockheads and many others.,In our early conversations Jake and I both wanted to relate the logo to polar-themed books and films of the Shackleton era, so he created an Art Nouveau-style typeface and used this to spell out the title of the novel, before using computer software to ‘morph’ the lettering, as if it were melting and dripping down the page: ‘going south’ as the title suggests. Normally one associates the name of Shackleton with snow and ice, with cold colours such as pale blues or white, but we wanted to  reflect the kind of colouring that is used on maps to communicate global temperature increases. Our logo is spelt out in bold yellow, and as it melts the logo changes subtly to a warmer orange.,Jake Tilson’s logo for
Shackleton’s Man Goes South
is a crucial part of the designs for both the novel and the
Atmosphere
Gallery display. It has been a huge privilege to work with a great British designer like Jake Tilson. I hope that his melting logo for

will intrigue Science Museum visitors, as well as giving some clues about my book and the story it contains."

I’ve always assumed it was just because of their size but the reason is actually more scientific than that.,Wind turbines can only capture energy from wind that is moving in a single direction. In urban spaces, tall buildings push wind in many directions at once, making it impossible for us to harness this resource. The winners of the 2018 Dyson Prize, Nicolas Orellana and Yaseen Noorani, think they can change that.,Their invention, the O-Wind, is a small, spherical wind turbine – the first to catch vertical, horizontal and diagonal wind at the same time. This makes it perfect for apartment dwellers to install on their balconies. Orellana doesn’t yet know exactly how much electricity the O-Wind will be able to generate but it will be more likely to power a single electronic device than your entire flat.,Britain has lowered its greenhouse gas emissions by more than 20% in the last decade but we still aren’t on track to reach our emissions targets by 2050. Would charging our mobile phones with a wind turbine really make a difference?,Probably not. Each of us has a carbon footprint – the amount of greenhouse gases, like methane and carbon dioxide, that we put into the atmosphere. For the average person living in Britain, that amounts to more than nine tonnes per year.,Some parts of our carbon footprint are easy to calculate, like the carbon dioxide that is emitted when we drive a car, instead of walk or cycle. Others are harder to work out because they come from the roles we play in larger supply chains, like the food we choose to buy. Beef, for example, has a bigger carbon footprint than chicken or pork, but how much more depends on many factors.,Powering a single device with an O-Wind, rather than other sources of electricity, won’t make a big difference to the global carbon footprint. But our other actions can.,One of the biggest impacts an individual can make is limiting their air travel – one return transatlantic flight adds more than a tonne to each passenger’s carbon footprint. Knowing this is not enough to make most people skip their holiday but a study by Birkbeck University suggests that people would be more likely to avoid flying in an effort to reduce their carbon footprint if they know that someone else has done the same.,Other research has found similar results in explaining our choices to install solar panels or have a meat-free lunch instead of a hamburger.,Reducing your own carbon footprint by installing an O-Wind won’t make a big difference on its own but it could be part of a larger cultural change. The more we value sustainability as a society, the more it will influence our bigger decisions.,There are more than 700 tower blocks in just London alone, and with 60% of city dwellers living in apartments, that’s a lot of balconies! That’s a lot of mobile phones that could soon be charging in a clean, sustainable way, reminding us to think about our carbon footprint when we’re out buying our groceries or planning that next holiday.,See the O-wind on display in our

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/how-long-should-we-grow-human-embryos-in-the-lab/,Roger Highfield,How long should we grow human embryos in the lab?,"Roger Highfield discusses the ethical dimensions of reproductive science to mark our new exhibition, IVF: 6 Million Babies Later.","At the Museum,Exhibitions and Galleries,Science in the news","biology,ivf,medicine,women in science","The ‘14-day rule’ is a widely observed ethical line past which human embryos are not allowed to be grown outside the body, and has been enshrined in law in 12 countries, including the United Kingdom. However, recent advances in our ability to grow human embryos in the laboratory have led to calls for the 14-day rule to be relaxed.,It was Baroness Mary Warnock, an English philosopher of morality and education, who in 1984 led a committee which explored the borderlands that lie between acceptable and unacceptable research on the human embryo.,,Remarkably, the UK still abides by their recommendations, which were enshrined in the UK in the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act in 1990, making Warnock arguably the most influential proponent of applied bioethics in recent decades.,In her original report, Warnock came up with a practical way for society to deal with the ethical and moral fallout of the most momentous event in human embryology, the birth of the first IVF baby, Louise Brown, by reconciling the irreconcilable: the views of religious fundamentalists who treated the early embryo as a person, and scientific pragmatists who regarded it as a collection of cells. Then she had to build a bridge of consensus for how to regulate this work between the public, media, parliamentarians and the scientists.,Once the euphoria surrounding the birth of Louise Brown in 1978 had abated, concerns about growing human embryos in the laboratory for experiments would steadily grow. There was a perception that scientists could not be certain of the outcome of implanting artificially-conceived embryos, indeed many were appalled by the thought that scientists could discard living embryos that were deemed imperfect. Some, as Warnock put it, thought that this was tantamount to ‘throwing a baby away.’ Consternation followed the admission by Edwards in a February 1982 television documentary that he had experimented on embryos he had no intention of implanting into patients: ‘they can teach us things about early human life’.,In June of 1982 Norman Fowler, the Government’s Secretary of State for Health and Social Services, wrote to Warnock, then a University of Oxford philosopher and educationalist, to invite her to advise ministers on whether IVF should be banned and, if it did go ahead, how it should be regulated. Warnock had huge respect for the public who she believed were ‘entitled to know, and even to control’ professional practices, an appetite for public engagement that feels very contemporary.,Warnock herself was ‘completely ignorant’ about embryology and the earliest stages of human development and, despite the broad representation on her select committee, she needed help. One member alone would prove crucial to the outcome of her inquiry: the Cambridge University developmental biologist, Anne McLaren.,In recognition of how the early embryo is not the same as a person, or a child, 14 days was adopted as the limit for embryo research. In paragraph 45, the Warnock report recommended that ‘it be a criminal offence to handle or to use as a research subject any live human embryo derived from in vitro fertilisation beyond that limit (i.e. fourteen days after fertilisation)’.,The 14-day limit was chosen for good reason. First, Mary Warnock wanted an unequivocal limit that rested on a defined period rather than a stage of development, which could at best be open to interpretation. Moreover, 14 days was around that time a human embryo elongates and develops a line called the primitive streak, which marks a channel where the spinal cord will eventually grow. Some have described this as the first developmental stage at which the embryo can develop into a more complex organism which can plausibly be nothing other than a human being.,The reception to her report was, she admits, mixed. Of all her opponents perhaps the most implacable was the chief rabbi, Immanuel Jacobowitz. He mounted attack after attack – one
Times
article carried the headline ‘Warnock destroys morality’. This headline, she recalled with a wry smile, delighted her husband Geoffrey, a fellow philosopher and then Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford.,When the legislation eventually came before them, parliamentarians were offered a choice between prohibiting all embryo research and permitting it in defined circumstances.  By then the public debate had moved on, focusing now on the possibilities of adapting the now established method of IVF to screen embryos for genetic disease. Aware of the possibilities, parliamentarians chose the latter course to allow IVF and experimentation but legislated that embryos could not be kept or used ‘after the appearance of the primitive streak’.  The 14-day limit became law.,In recent years, Warnock believes that her report has held up ‘quite well, particularly the 14-day rule’. She told me that if ever she feels despondent, she reassures herself by thinking about her report: ‘Well, at least I did
that
’.,But even the Warnock report envisaged that a day would come when the 14-day limit would be challenged with ‘the maintenance of developing embryos in an artificial environment (ectogenesis) for progressively longer periods’. Only recently has it become possible to grow embryos for longer than 14 days, in the light of
recent work in the University of Cambridge by Magdalena Zernicka-Goetz
and
in America
and this could pave the way for research to improve IVF efficacy by identifying markers of successful development, help understand the causes of early embryo loss in pregnancy end the misery of miscarriage, and further understand the effects of drugs, alcohol and toxic compounds in embryos.,Baroness Warnock agrees that there is a great deal that could be learned by extending this limit but argues that the public need more time to understand the basics of what was being proposed and what scientists want to do with embryos grown for longer in the laboratory. If this advance in growing human embryos immediately prompted a loosening of legislation to, say, a 21-day limit, then it would stir ever-present fears about sliding down the ‘slippery slope’.,In the longer term, there are other points at which a line might be drawn to curb embryo research, and these were also explored by the Warnock Committee. Perhaps in the beginnings of a central nervous system (at around 22–23 days) or much later, when functional activity in the brain can show if pain could be felt (today we know that connections to the cortex are not intact before 24 weeks of gestation and, as most neuroscientists believe that the cortex is necessary for pain perception, the foetus cannot experience pain in any sense prior to this point in gestation).,Decades later, the thinking in the Warnock report remains as relevant as ever.,Baroness Warnock was a Patron of the
Progress Educational Trust
and won the
Dan David Prize
in 2018.,"
https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/history-of-the-wheelchair/,Kay Nias,History of the Wheelchair,"To celebrate International Wheelchair Day on the 1st March, Research Fellow Kay Nias explores the history behind what has arguably been the most important mobility device in history.",Collections and Objects,"discover the collection,medicine,medicine galleries,technology,transport","The wheelchair is a piece of technology that we are all familiar with, used by millions of people with disabilities around the world.,The history of the wheelchair shows us how technological advancements have been driven by the changing demands, circumstances and ingenuity of wheelchair riders throughout time.,When was the first wheelchair invented?,While it is uncertain as to what can be considered the first wheelchair, stone inscriptions from Ancient China and Greece suggest that wheelchair-type furniture has been used at least since the sixth century AD.,Perhaps one of the best-documented early examples, however, was made by an unknown inventor for King Philip of Spain (1527-98), in 1595, who in his later years suffered from severe gout which made walking difficult. This chair was elaborate in its design with plush upholstery, arm and leg rests, and four small wheels which meant that he (conveniently) needed to be pushed around by a servant.,The first self-propelled wheelchair was invented in 1655 by paraplegic clock-maker of Nuremberg, Germany Stephan Farfler (1633-1689), who built his own mobility aid when he was only 22 after having broken his back as a child.,Using his mechanical expertise as a clock-maker, Fafler’s wheelchair frame was based on a three-wheel chassis and worked by turning handles attached to a geared front wheel using a system of cranks and cogwheels.,While it wouldn’t be for another few hundred years until the invention of the bicycle, it is easy to see this wheelchair as a forerunner.,The Science Museum Group has an interesting example of a self-propelled chair inspired by Fafler’s design in its
collection
. Built in Britain between 1910-1920, this chair has three main wheels and driven via chains by two hand cranks either side of the rider.,From the second-half of the eighteenth century a number of important wheelchair developments occurred in the town of Bath. At this time Bath was a popular spa town destination for the sick and disabled from across Britain and Europe who sought comfort and healing from the mineral waters and physical therapy offered there.,To meet the demand created by immobile visitors wishing to take the waters, a number of wheelchairs were designed and became available to rent. The most popular design of this period was that of John Dawson whose 1783 ‘Bath Chair’ was a model supported by two wheels joined by an axle underneath the seat, with a small pivoting wheel in front of the supporting footrest.,The Bath Chair could be steered by the rider via a long curved rod connected to the front wheel, though it still had to be pushed by an attendant. Variations of the Bath Chair quickly became very popular and soon rivalled the
Sedan chair
(an enclosed box with a seat carried on poles by two men) as a form of transportation for wealthy disabled people across Britain. The
Science Museum Group Collection
even has a Bath Chair made for Queen Victoria in 1893 for her later, less agile years.,Patents show that throughout the nineteenth century many improvements were made to the wheelchair to promote comfort, manoeuvrability and independence, including the invention of rear push wheels and push-rims.,Perhaps the most commercially successful wheelchair to be marketed was the revolutionary ‘X-frame’ folding wheelchair. Developed in the 1930s by American engineers Harry Jennings and Herbert Everest – after the latter became paraplegic in a mining accident – the relatively lightweight and easily transportable chair is still familiar today.,The
Science Museum Group Collection
has a ‘Model 8’ version of this folding wheelchair built in the 1950s. Used in hospitals, nursing homes and private institutions, the Model 8 could be manoeuvred either by the patient via the metal rims attached to each wheel or by an assistant pushing the chair.,Unprecedented advancements in manual wheelchair technology have been witnessed since the 1930s with materials such as aluminium and titanium making devices much lighter than older steel versions, and with the advent of athletic models specifically adapted for sports performance.,The ‘Shadow Racer’ sports wheelchair for example, was designed for track and road racing by Jim Martinson, an injured Vietnam veteran. Manufactured by the company Quickie Designs in the early 1990s alongside tennis and basketball chairs, the development of sports wheelchairs highlights the role of personal ambition driving technological adaptions and advancements.,Today the wheelchair is one of the most commonly used assistive devices for enhancing the personal mobility of people with disabilities. Considered a basic human right for people with limited mobility by the
World Health Organisation
, it opens up a world of independence and enables participation in social, economic and cultural life.,International Wheelchair Day is a welcome moment both to celebrate the innovative technological advancements which have changed the lives of millions, but also to consider the reality that throughout history – as is still the case today in most developing countries – only the privileged few who need wheelchairs actually have access to them."
https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/the-centenary-of-the-spanish-flu/,Jack Davies,The centenary of the Spanish flu,"In 1918, as the First World War ended and peace celebrations began, a new enemy emerged - the Spanish flu.","At the Museum,Collections and Objects","discover the collection,history,medicine,war","In 1918, as the First World War ended and peace celebrations began, a new enemy emerged.,That year saw the beginning of one of the deadliest pandemics in our world’s history. Spanish flu spread to every corner of the world and, unlike many other diseases, it killed young, healthy adults aged between 20 and 40 years old, instead of groups considered to be more vulnerable, such as children and the elderly.,Estimates put the death toll at 3 to 5 per cent of the world’s population, amounting to 50 to 100 million people.,But what was the so-called Spanish flu?,The symptoms were gruesome, and they developed quickly. Patients had the normal flu-like symptoms: sore throats, headaches, fatigue, shivering, fevers, and body aches. But they also developed deep brown spots on their cheeks, they coughed up blood or bled from their ears, and their faces turned blue as a build-up of bloody fluid stopped the circulation of oxygenated blood. Many patients drowned, unable to breathe through the bloody froth that filled their lungs.,Most Spanish flu related deaths were caused by pneumonia, a secondary infection that overwhelmed patients’ weakened immune systems.,While many people think that the disease came from Spain, Spanish flu is a misnomer, and historians still debate where it originated. So why do we call it the Spanish flu?,In short, it’s because of the First World War. More specifically, it was because of the need to control the spread of information through censorship. Most countries involved in the war censored their domestic press to prevent information from helping the enemy.,Though reports from battlefields or numbers of wounded or dead were the obvious targets of the censor, it extended far beyond that. In Britain it covered anything likely to cause ‘dissatisfaction’ in the population: including the spread of disease.,It was only Spain, a neutral country in the First World War, that published accurate information on the influenza pandemic, creating the false impression that Spain was more heavily affected. Thus, the disease was dubbed ‘the Spanish flu’.,The disease was caused by the H1N1 strain of the influenza virus. Though the 1918 virus was once considered a ‘superbug’, this theory has since been discredited.  Now we know that the 1918 strain was very similar to other strains of influenza, a model of which we have in our collection.,So, if Spanish flu was not a superbug, how did it kill so many people?,The First World War created the perfect environment for disease to spread; mass migration of populations, overcrowding in hospitals, barracks, and prisoner of war camps, and weakened immune systems due to malnourishment all allowed the virus to spread quickly. Soldiers from all corners of the globe fought in battles that spanned the entire world, spreading the germs they picked up along the way. Those who survived the war went home in 1918, taking the influenza virus with them to their friends and family.,As quickly as it appeared, the Spanish flu epidemic died out. It was suggested that its spread was controlled by quarantining patients, but it is more likely that this strain of influenza changed to become less severe.,Though this sounds unusual, it is not that uncommon. Many strains of influenza become weaker as time goes on because stronger strains kill their hosts too quickly, limiting the time the virus has to spread and infect others.,There were very few treatment options for patients with Spanish flu in 1918. Most medicines were aimed at making the patient as comfortable as possible by reducing fevers and alleviating pain. The Science Museum Group Collection holds examples of influenza treatment methods from the twentieth century, such as ‘Fennings’ Little Healers’ and ‘Kaputine’ medicine both pictured above.,Now, we would probably prescribe antiviral medicine like Tamiflu, which was distributed during the swine flu pandemic of 2009. This object was donated to the museum by one of our medical curators, whose child was thought to have contracted the disease.,As well as commemorating the centenary of the First World War over the last four years, it is also important that we recognise the longer-term impacts of the conflict. The Spanish flu pandemic was one of the biggest threats that the world has ever faced. In one year, it killed more people than four years of the Black Death.,But this is much more than just an episode of medical history, it is a stark reminder of the long-term consequences of war, and the dangers that viral infections pose.,Influenza still exists, and the virus continues to mutate and change. Experts believe that it is not a case of
if
, but rather,
when
a new influenza pandemic will spread throughout the world."
https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/total-immersion-pain-and-scientific-creativity/,Roger Highfield,"Total immersion, creativity and the world’s best selling drug","In the run up to the opening of our Medicine Galleries later this year, Roger Highfield reports on an unlikely story of how a road rage attack provided the secret of scientific success, leading to a Nobel Prize.",Research,"medicine,medicine galleries,nobel prize,research","The unlikely story of how a road rage attack provided the secret of scientific success was recounted earlier this month by
Sir Greg Winter
, who shared a
Nobel Prize
last year for research that paved the way for the world’s best-selling drug.,Sir Greg, a pioneer in engineering proteins, told an audience in Oxford how six of the top ten best-selling drugs in the world today are based on antibodies, which are exquisitely-shaped proteins produced by the immune system that are able to bind to targets in the body for a vast range of uses, from diagnostics to drugs.,After giving the
Norman Heatley Lecture
at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, Sir Greg was asked how he had been so creative, not least in finding three ways to create antibody drugs: humanising mouse antibodies, creating a way to shuffle a library of genes by harnessing the power of evolution, and creating a variety called bicyclic peptides, or Bicycles.,Aside from hard work, the protein chemist said the secret of success came after being ‘attacked on the way to work,’ after which he was unable to use his right arm and was in constant pain. In the attack his right arm was dislocated badly causing severe nerve damaged paralysis.,With his right arm in a sling, Sir Greg trained himself to use the latest computer graphics with his good arm so he could study the details of the molecular shape of antibodies. ’When I was looking at antibodies, the pain stopped,’ he said. ‘It was a distraction therapy.’,The ‘total immersion’ in antibody structures for 12-hour days helped to distract him from the ‘terrible pain’ and gave him the insights to develop humanised antibodies. His biggest ideas have come from working day and night. ‘It loosens up my brain a bit and ideas come floating through your head.’,Previously, it had proved impossible to make human antibodies to fight diseases such as cancer or rheumatoid arthritis – we are self-tolerant, that is, we can’t readily make antibodies against our own tissues. Meanwhile, the corresponding rodent antibodies, had provoked an immune response when given to patients.,Sir Greg is credited with inventing techniques to humanise rodent monoclonal antibodies in 1986, where monoclonal means of one type that binds to one target substance, and to create fully human monoclonal antibodies in 1991. This remarkable ability to bind to one target can be used in many ways, from spotting a disease agent to highlighting a target in the body and delivering a toxin to a cancer cell.,For his work on ‘harnessing the power of evolution’, Sir Greg was awarded the 2018 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, along with George Smith and Frances Arnold.,Sir Greg was cited specifically by the Nobel academy ‘for the phage display of peptides and antibodies’, the technology that led to the fully human antibody ‘Humira’, which is now the world’s top-selling pharmaceutical drug and used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, among other conditions.,However, Sir Greg added that it is important not to be too focused: he and a colleague came close to devising a way to amplify genes a few years before the development of another Nobel Prize winning innovation to do just this, called PCR, or polymerase chain reaction.,‘The reason we missed it was that we were too focused on what our goal was,’ he said, though he added that, though a ‘terrible mistake’, it might have diverted him from his antibody work if he had succeeded.,Sir Greg founded three Cambridge-based start-up companies to help develop therapeutic drugs based on his inventions, and his research career has been based almost entirely at the
Medical Research Council’s Laboratory of Molecular Biology
and the MRC Centre for Protein Engineering, in Cambridge.,Over a 25-year period Sir Greg has generated something like £900 million for the Medical Research Council and his secret of scientific creativity was ‘total immersion’ and to forget work-life balance, he told the packed audience.,His lecture was introduced by Prof Matthew Freeman, head of the university’s Dunn School, one of the UK’s top biomedical research departments, which organised the event: ‘Sir Greg has probably done more than anyone in the world to apply the tools of fundamental molecular biology to transform human health. A third of new drugs are based on his technologies. Given the impact he has had on human health, he may be a rare case where the Nobel Prize itself is not his proudest achievement.’"

Britain’s greatest achievement.,Since the NHS was founded, not only have illnesses, technologies, and budgets changed, but the UK population has grown vastly and aged in demographic. In 1948 life expectancy was
66 for men and 70 for women
. Today, it is 79.2 and 82.9 respectively.,With an aging population, as well as increased demand and expectations, pressures on the NHS are higher than ever before.,This blog post explores 70 years of the NHS in 7 objects: one for each decade.,To represent the NHS, an ideal and a concept, through objects has been a challenging and fascinating feat.,Free spectacles were one of the first provisions offered by the newly formed NHS. For many people at this time, spectacles would have been a large expense, only affordable to the wealthy or through schemes like National Health Insurance.,Public demand was huge, far exceeding the government’s predictions. In the first year alone, the provision of spectacles cost the NHS almost five times more than expected.,Spectacles such as
these
were mass-produced to be cheap and robust and showed little imagination or design flare. The limited range of NHS frames available later led them to become a social stigma.,Like me you might be thinking, glasses today are not so dissimilar… though today this style is a fashion statement.,The oral contraceptive, better known simply as
‘the pill’
, was first made available through the NHS in the 1960s. This revolutionary contraceptive allowed women to control their own fertility, dramatically contributing to women’s liberation and to the sexual freedom of the so-called “Swinging Sixties”.,Initially, the pill was only made available to married women, but this law was relaxed in 1967 and by 1974 all contraceptive advice and prescriptions were free of charge on the NHS, irrespective of age or marital status.,It is
estimated
that 70% of all women in Britain have used the pill at some stage in their lives. And though this tiny pill still attracts strong and conflicting opinions, it is impossible to deny the impact it has had and continues to have on women’s lives.,In 1972 CT scanners transformed the way doctors examine the body. Using a technique called computerised tomography (CT), images are built up from a large series of measurements taken by an X-ray source and detector. This remarkable technology, designed by Godfrey Hounsfield at EMI, enabled medical professionals to view detailed images of patients’ brains for the first time.,This brain scanner
was the model used in the first trials on patients in 1971. After its introduction, the EMI brain scanner, though expensive, was adopted in substantial numbers for medicine.,The NHS has been instrumental in providing childhood vaccinations free of charge.,In 1968 when the vaccination against measles was first introduced, the number of cases a year varied between 160,000 and 800,000. Take up was low for many years following its introduction and measles remained a major cause of infant death.,When the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine was introduced in 1988, health education posters such as this played a substantial role in encouraging public participation, resulting in reports of measles falling dramatically.,The NHS has played a significant role in organ transplant, with the first kidney, heart and liver transplants occurring in the 1960s.,Kidney donor cards
were the first organ donor cards established by the NHS in 1971. In the 1980s, these donor cards were amended to include other organs such as the heart and liver. But despite millions of individuals carrying such cards, it wasn’t until 1994 that the Organ Donor Register was set up by the NHS.,With the launch of the
Donor Register
it was made easier for individuals to sign up and express their wishes. The scheme was an invaluable introduction with over 2.2 million people joining the database in its first year. Today there are more than 24 million donors ‘opted in’ on the register (roughly 38% of the UK population).,There continues to be a shortage of donor organs and supplying the high demand relies solely on voluntary registration.,Paramedic bikes are now a familiar sight for many people living in large cities, but the ambulance Cycle Response Unit (CRU) was only established in the early 2000s.,The idea to form the CRU came from former British BMX racing champion Tom Lynch MBE. After retiring from competing aged 22, Tom re-trained as a paramedic.,As anyone who’s attempted to drive through London will know, traffic can be congested and progress unbearably slow. It was this that caused Tom to consider reaching an incident by bike.,In 2000 the NHS agreed to trial a paramedic cycle service. In the trial’s first hour alone, Tom received and answered five calls and cancelled 5 ambulances.,Today, there are more than 120 pedalling paramedics, providing the NHS with approximate savings of up to 6000 hours per year in ambulance time. This not only helps ease pressure on A&E departments but also saves the NHS around £1million a year.,New research is constantly being developed from within the NHS. With technology evolving, researchers are striving to provide new and improved medical practices.,It might be hard to imagine the relationship between a 3D printer and life-changing transplant surgery, but in 2016 the world’s first 3D printed models were used by surgeons to plan a successful kidney transplant.,These remarkable 3D printed objects were created from MRI scans of a father’s kidney and his two-year-old daughter’s abdomen, in preparation for a kidney transplant operation between parent and child.,Surgeon Pankaj Chandak from Guys and St Thomas’ Hospital Trust developed the idea of using 3D printed models to help plan complex operations outside the high-pressure environment of the operating theatre.,For many people living in Britain today, the NHS has been a constant backdrop to our encounters with health – from the cradle through to the grave.,It’s impossible to predict where the NHS will be in another 70 years. Who knows what the technologies and policies of the future will hold.,Join us at the Science Museum on Wednesday 25 July 2018 for our special
NHS Lates

The heir to the Romanov throne, Prince Alexei is probably the most famous person to have had the condition, and I’ve always been fascinated by the stories of the miracle “healer” Rasputin.,Of course, Alexei lived during a time when haemophilia hadn’t even been identified and no treatment existed. Records describe his suffering, often being bed-bound and carried around. I know how painful bleeds can be, even in the presence of treatment.,Growing up severe haemophilia B didn’t exactly contribute to a normal childhood, but then again what really is “normal” anyway?,Whilst haemophilia has impacted my life in many ways, I can draw more positives than negatives from my experiences. Now, at the age of 24, it’s just a part of who I am, something I have adapted to, but not the thing that defines me.,Perhaps one of the most challenging moments growing was having to learn how to intravenously inject myself. People with severe haemophilia B need to inject a treatment called factor IX. It’s an important protein which helps blood to clot, which my body doesn’t produce on its own. I inject it every couple of days, which temporarily replaces the missing protein and treats bleeds if and when they happen.,I am at risk of prolonged and painful internal bleeding in to my muscles and joints, which can lead to joint damage and arthritis. Sadly, this is something I have acquired after many bleeds in to my ankles, but you learn to adapt and live with it.,And no, I won’t bleed to death if I get a papercut!,For a 7-year-old, injecting factor isn’t an easy skill to learn. I’d miss my vein a lot, it would be painful and I’d get extremely upset. It took a fair few years before I could safely call myself a “pro” at injecting myself, but I count myself very lucky that I live at the time when haemophilia is well understood and treatment is available.,I can only begin to imagine how painful and scary it must have been for Alexei, especially with no treatment available for his condition, and at a time when doctors didn’t understand what caused these bleeds.,In many of the famous photographs of Tsarevich Alexei he is posed with a box under one foot, thought to be because his knee joint was so severely damaged from bleeding that he wasn’t able to straighten it. Fortunately, I haven’t sustained joint damage this severe.,I am one of the lucky ones. I was born in the “right place, at the right time.”,Right now 75% of people with haemophilia in the world do not have access to adequate treatment so many people with the condition don’t make it to adulthood, or live with joint deformation like Tsarevich Alexei experienced.,I’ve travelled to meet people living with haemophilia whose quality of life is significantly impacted due to healthcare and treatment inequality. These experiences have been extremely humbling and helped put a lot of things in perspective for me.,This is one of the main reasons I now dedicate much of my time to the haemophilia community, which has been one of the most influential things in helping me accept and embrace my condition.,Seeing Alexei’s experiences and treatment he would have received in
The Last Tsar: Blood and Revolution
, it’s incredible to see how much life for people with haemophilia has changed. But I want to see that all of those living with haemophilia have access to safe, effective treatment and equal opportunities in life.,Looking back through history can show us how far we have come, but at the same time, show us how much more there is still to do.,Hear more from Luke on

Crafted in 1885 for Tsar Alexander III to gift to his wife Empress Maria Fyodorovna, the ‘Jewelled Hen Egg’ was 2.5 inches tall, with a white enamelled ‘shell’ and yellow-gold ‘yolk’ complete with a gold hen. The eggs went on to become more extravagant using materials such as gold, pearls and precious stones. It was not until the First World War that the eggs reverted to simpler designs to reflect the austere mood of the time – in part due to shortage of resources but also as the imperial family could not be seen to be commissioning such frivolous and expensive gifts at a time when all of Russia was drowning in war.,The two Fabergé eggs on display in our exhibition,
The Last Tsar: Blood and Revolution
, date from the First World War and both speak to this historical context in their own way.,The Imperial Red Cross Easter Egg was made in 1915 to honour the contributions of Tsarina Alexandra and her two eldest daughters, Olga and Tatiana, in the war effort as Red Cross Sisters of Mercy. It is made of silver and gold, white and red enamel with watercolour on gold and glass and is almost 3.4 inches tall.,The front of the egg divides into two quarters, revealing an intricate triptych within. The central scene depicts the
Harrowing of Hell
, the Orthodox representation of the Resurrection, while the two outer scenes contain miniatures of the patron saints of the Tsarina’s daughters – St Olga, the founder of Christianity in Russia, and the martyr saint Tatiana.,The Tsarina and her two eldest daughters volunteered with the Red Cross during the First World and were trained in nursing at the Tsarskoe Selo Hospital by a pioneering woman surgeon, Princess Vera Gedroits. They broke royal tradition at the time with their hands-on approach to work at the hospital, attending to the wounded and even assisting with surgeries.,While the Red Cross Egg speaks to the Imperial women’s efforts on the home front, the Steel Military Easter Egg recognises the Tsar’s work at the General Military Headquarters and his role as Commander-in-Chief of the Russian army. The egg stands at 4 inches with the miniature painting hidden inside.,The Steel Military Easter Egg was the last of the fifty Imperial Fabergé Easter eggs to be completed and was presented as a gift from Tsar Nicholas II to his wife Tsarina Alexandra in 1916. Just a year later, the Tsar would abdicate, and the family would become prisoners of the provisional government.,The egg was designed during the war by one of Carl Fabergé’s relatives, and was manufactured at the Putilovskii Steel Plant which was well-known for the quality of its steel. This Easter Egg is unusual for not being as lavishly embellished a some of its counterparts – during the turmoil of the war, limitations to resources meant that jewellers were no longer using silver and gold.,Made after Tsar Nicholas II had taken personal charge of the Russian army in 1915, the egg contains a miniature painting of the Tsar and his son Alexei reading maps at the war front – intended to represent the Tsar as a great military leader to be succeeded by his son Alexei in the future. It sits on four legs made to represent artillery shells, one of the newest weapons of the time. Almost foreboding of the fate of Russia and the imperial family, the steel of the ‘shell’ was originally black, but began to rust shortly after it had been delivered to the Tsarina. It now appears silver after being polished to prevent it from deteriorating.,This blog was written alongside our free exhibition The Last Tsar: Blood and Revolution, exploring the life and death of Tsar Nicholas II and his family and the forensic investigation into their murder.

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/history-of-the-handheld-games-console/,Mark Cutmore,History of the handheld games console,"To celebrate Power UP, our hands-on gaming event, we take a look back at the history of handheld gaming.",Exhibitions and Galleries,"gaming,Power UP","This Easter sees the return of
Power UP
to the Science Museum and for the first time we’re making handheld games consoles playable. 2019 also marks the 30
th
anniversary of the release of the Game Boy and the end of production of the PlayStation Vita, so we’re taking a look back at the history of handheld gaming.,While the Milton-Bradley Microvision was the first handheld console to feature interchangeable games, in 1979 most other companies were still selling devices loaded with a single game. This included the popular Nintendo Game & Watch range launched in 1980. The devices were designed by Gunpei Yokoi, a maintenance engineer who had impressed the President of Nintendo with his homemade toys during a chance visit to the factory Yokoi worked in. Yokoi became one of Nintendo’s leading designers and helped shape the company into the gaming giant we know today.,In 1989 Yokoi’s Game Boy was released by Nintendo. It featured a monochrome display and simple technology which helped with battery life. It was bundled with games like
Super Mario Land
and
Tetris
, which were huge hits, making the Game Boy an immediate success.,Other consoles were launched around the same time by Nintendo’s rivals Atari and Sega. Both the Atari Lynx and Sega Game Gear were more advanced than the Game Boy, including more powerful graphics and colour displays. Power came at a cost though, with both consoles being bulkier than the Game Boy and having much shorter battery lives. Battery life was made even worse with Game Gear’s unusual TV tuner add-on which turned your games console into a portable TV… for a short amount of time.,As technology moved on through the 90s consoles got lighter and more advanced. Nintendo finally made the leap into colour gaming with the Game Boy Color in 1998, keeping away competition including the SNK Neo Geo Pocket and Bandai Wonderswan – the last product to be designed by Gunpei Yokoi having left Nintendo.,Nintendo continued to release new versions of its console, each aiming to improve the format; from the Game Boy Advance (2001) and flip-screen Game Boy Advance SP (2003) through to the tiny Game Boy Micro (2005) with its 5cm screen.,About this time the mobile phone market started trying to get in on the action with the launch of the Nokia N-Gage in 2003. An attempt at a hybrid between a mobile phone and a games console the phone struggled to be great at either. The phone’s battery had to be removed to change the game cartridge and the button layout made gaming difficult. Mobile phones would stick to
Snake
for a few more years.,Nintendo finally began to retire the Game Boy brand in 2004 with the release of the DS. Its dual screen display opened new ways of playing; a format that has remained through 10 variations to the present day. This includes the 3DS released in 2011, allowing 3D gaming without glasses.,Meanwhile Sony had their own plans to enter the handheld market, introducing the PSP (PlayStation Portable) in early 2005. Featuring high quality graphics and major support from big-name game developers, many saw this as the first real challenge to Nintendo’s reign over the handheld market. The PSP and its successor the Vita which launched in 2011 had some success, but around 2008 and along with Nintendo’s consoles they faced the biggest shift in portable gaming since the Game Boy was released almost 20 years earlier…,In 2007 Apple released the first iPhone and a year later they opened the App Store. Now people could start downloading games directly to their mobile phone. The following year
Angry Birds
was released, and soon casual gaming began to shape the entire industry. Thanks to games like
Candy Crush
and
Pokémon Go
timed events, free-to-play models and micro-transactions are now commonplace in many games.,Mobile gaming is often dismissed when compared to ‘hardcore’ console-based gaming but in 2018 smartphone and tablet-based games represented 51% of global gaming revenue, around $70 billion. Mobile gaming also seems to have made gaming more accessible to women; 49% of mobile gamers are women compared to 41% of gamers overall.,But the story doesn’t end there for handheld consoles. In 2017 Nintendo released the Switch. A hybrid console that both docks to a screen for home gaming but can also be used in ‘tablet mode’, allowing people to flexibly play at home and on the go. The Switch is seen by many as a return to form for Nintendo and in tablet-mode it’s easy to see a legacy that started with their first Game & Watch handheld back in 1980.,Explore the evolution of gaming at

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/joseph-bazalgette-londons-sewer-king/,Stewart Emmens,"Happy Birthday, London’s ‘Sewer King’!","On 28 March 1819, Joseph William Bazalgette was born, known for transforming London’s sewage system and improving the health of Victorian Londoners.",Collections and Objects,"engineering,history,medicine,medicine galleries,wellcome collection","As guest of honour The Prince of Wales, later King Edward VII, entered the brand new sewage pumping house at
Crossness
in early April 1865, its powerful engines surged into action.,The final key element in the largest civil engineering project of the nineteenth century, London’s sewer system, was up and running.,At the celebratory banquet, the Prince toasted the
Metropolitan Board of Works
, who oversaw the project, and its chief engineer and designer Joseph Bazalgette:,‘This work will be of material use to London, not so much now, perhaps, as in the future, when I hope London will become one of the healthiest cities in Europe’.,And he was right, it was not just a great feat of engineering it was a great advance for public health. Bazalgette had designed for a healthier future and through his work he arguably prevented more death and disease in this country than any other Victorian.,Initially a railway engineer, Bazalgette was employed as a surveyor in the newly created Metropolitan Commission of Sewers in 1849 before becoming its engineer three years later.,With London’s population more than doubling between 1800 and 1850, existing systems of human waste collection, removal and disposal were being overwhelmed.,One of the Commission’s first moves was to order the closure of domestic cesspits. Dug on open ground or beneath housing, they were the traditional means of storing human waste. Houses were instead to be connected to the existing sewers, which emptied directly into the River Thames.,Ironically, these measures were a response to the growing recognition that the health of the city, and its citizens, were in urgent need of improvement.,Britain’s first
cholera
outbreak had reached London in 1832, killing several thousand. It was a key event from which a momentum for such reforms emerged. Given the then prevailing belief in the miasma theory, whereby diseases were caused by foul-smelling air-born vapours, sanitary reform was viewed as particularly crucial. Unfortunately, the theory itself was nonsense.,Cholera is a water-born disease and when it struck London again in 1848, over 14,000 died. The result of actively removing waste from thousands of households had been to contaminate the Thames – the city’s main water supply.,Miasma theory was wrong, but it was the smell, or rather the ‘stink’, of London that was the tipping point. By the mid-1800s, the Thames was an open sewer where tons of faecal matter washed back and forth on daily tides. During the hot summer of 1858 the stench was overwhelming, especially for the Thameside occupants of the Houses of Parliament.,‘
The Great Stink
’ focused the minds of politicians who sanctioned a building project on a hitherto unseen scale. The task of building a new sewer network was assigned to the Metropolitan Board of Works, the successor to the earlier Commission, and its chief engineer Joseph Balzalgette.,His solution was a system that channeled sewage and waste water through miles of tunnels into a series of main intercepting sewers. Set at a slight gradient, and assisted by pumping stations, they slowly transported it eastwards where it was ejected into sections of the Thames where it would be swept out to sea.,Fortunately, Bazalgette insisted on broad brick-walled tunnels rather than the narrow pipes favoured by some contemporaries. Considered as unnecessarily extravagant at the time, it allowed the system to cope with the subsequent increases in volume.,As well as making the single biggest improvement to the health of Victorian Londoners, it transformed the city above as well below ground. Long stretches of the intercepting sewers were hidden beneath vast embankments along the Thames. This reclaimed many acres of land and also changed the character of the river, which became much narrower and faster flowing.,The project progressed remarkably quickly, with much of London connected up by the end of 1865. Nevertheless, delays to allow new Underground lines to be housed in the embankments helped enable a final cholera epidemic the following year.,Of course, tons of raw sewage were also still being dumped further down-river into the Thames – sometimes with dreadful results. The death toll from the sinking of the pleasure boat
Princess Alice
in 1878 would have been smaller if it hadn’t sunk close to one of the sewage outfalls. Over 600 passengers died, many poisoned rather than drowned. The horror of this event prompted the subsequent building of riverside sewage treatment plants.,Such unfortunate incidents aside, Bazalgette’s creation has served generations well over many decades. This in spite of an increasing population and the emergence of hazards he would never have foreseen – such as wet wipes and
fatbergs
!,While significant
expansion
and improvements to the system continue, the many miles of Victorian tunnels remain at the core of the system.,So let’s all raise a glass – of something drinkable – and say Happy Birthday, Joseph Bazalgette!"
https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/haemophilia-the-bleeding-disease/,Dr Matthew Lumley,Haemophilia: The bleeding disease,"As part of our recent exhibition The Last Tsar: Blood and Revolution, rare disease expert, Dr Matthew Lumley, explains how the future is much brighter for people living with haemophilia today.",At the Museum,"biology,medicine,the last tsar","The short life of Tsarevich Alexei, explored in
The Last Tsar: Blood and Revolution
exhibition, was blighted by the bleeding disorder haemophilia. Dr Matthew Lumley, Rare Disease Medical Director, Pfizer UK, explains how the future is much brighter for today’s sufferers.,If you cut yourself, you stop bleeding because proteins in blood, known as clotting factors, combine with blood cells called platelets, making the blood sticky and
causing it to clot
. People with haemophilia are either missing an essential clotting factor or are unable to produce enough to make their blood clot. The severity of haemophilia is determined by the type of clotting factor that is deficient and also
how much of the clotting factor is made
. In severe haemophilia, a person may bleed once or twice a week, and
often for no apparent reason
.
About 10,000 people in the UK
have haemophilia.,The haemophilias are typically caused by a single gene mutation on the X chromosome, which means the condition largely affects men and boys. Boys like Tsarevich Alexei, born in 1904, who inherited haemophilia B, via his great grandmother Queen Victoria.,Until the advent of treatment, most people with severe haemophilia died in childhood or in early adulthood. Even in the 1960s, when treatments were available, it was still not possible to successfully prevent major bleeds. This
inability to adequately manage haemophiliac bleeding
made the condition very debilitating.,,By the 1970s, it was possible to make enough human-derived clotting factor to enable people to treat themselves at home. The change was revolutionary: haemophilia centres were able to change their focus from emergency care to developing care programmes aimed at improving the quality of life for people living with haemophilia.,But in the 1980s, it was discovered that much of the human-derived clotting factor had come from blood donations contaminated with blood-borne diseases, HIV and hepatitis viruses; thousands of people were infected and thousands subsequently died. Improved screening and new methods to deactivate viruses improved the safety of donated blood, but concern continued about the safety of human derived products.,Medical advances and clinical research in the 1980s and 1990s led to the development of man-made, ‘recombinant’ clotting factor that allowed for the industrial production of clotting factor and eliminated the risk of blood-borne infection. The availability of recombinant clotting factor has meant that people with haemophilia now have a normal life span.,Today, haemophilia is a treatable rare disease; however, frequent infusions of clotting factor are time consuming and have a considerable negative impact on the quality of life of patients with haemophilia.,Treatment of haemophilia continues to evolve. Novel treatments that activate clotting rather than replace missing clotting factors have already arrived. Treatments in development include those that suppress the body’s natural ability to prevent clotting. One technology that excites people is gene therapy, which works by introducing corrected copies of missing or defective genes. In the case of haemophilia, the goal is to get the body to make the correct version of the missing clotting factor. If this could be achieved then, for some patients, it might be possible for haemophilia to be managed with a single treatment, reducing or even eliminating the need for treatment with replacement factors, thus greatly reducing the burden of this disease on patients and their loved ones.,This blog was written alongside our recent exhibition The Last Tsar: Blood and Revolution, exploring the life and death of Tsar Nicholas II and his family and the forensic investigation into their murder.

and our
blogs
.,Our team of curators have also been busy identifying, studying and collecting items which are significant enough to join the
Science Museum Group Collection
.,Since January, we’ve added over 700 items to this national collection of science, technology, engineering, medicine and media. We already care for 7.3 million items for the nation, so there’s a lot of competition to join the collection.,As 2018 draws to a close, we wanted to share a few of the fascinating objects which made it into the collection this year:,This Midas XL3 mixing console was used by many well-known musicians, bands and engineers to create a good sound for live shows between its manufacture in 1990 and 2018 when it joined the collection. Exactly 1000 were designed and built in Kidderminster, UK, and this console is serial number 003—the oldest one we know of.,Bands and artists who used this mixing desk include Prince, Foo Fighters, Björk, Amy Winehouse, PJ Harvey, The Who, Kings of Leon, Billy Bragg, Coldplay, Suzanne Vega, Madness, Motorhead, Robbie Williams, Jay-Z and many more.,The console
has even survived being trampled on. Artist Busta Rhymes was due to play at the Forum (where the console was used from 1996 – 2010) but didn’t show up. The crowd were already in the venue and reacted badly to the no show, trampling over the XL3. However, after the boot-prints had been cleaned off the console worked fine.,Curator Annie Jamieson has written more about how she researched and collected the desk
here
.,From a musical object to one that is political. Forty years after it was installed on the roof of the White House we acquired a
solar water heater
, which we displayed in our exhibition
The Sun: Living With Our Star
.,On 20 June 1979 the Democratic President of the USA Jimmy Carter used his great rhetorical skills to turn some unremarkable solar water heaters into political pawns: ‘Solar energy will not pollute our air or water. We will not run short of it. No one can ever embargo the Sun or interrupt its delivery to us…. I dedicate, this afternoon, this solar heater, harnessing the rays of the Sun to the benefit of those who serve our country at the White House.’,The 32 solar-thermal panels were installed on top of the East Wing of the White House that sunny afternoon. Working perfectly throughout Carter’s remaining years as President, the panels were in use until 1986, when Republican President Ronald Reagan chose not to have them reinstalled after a rooftop resurfacing.,You can read more about the solar heater
here
.,It might not look that impressive, but High Speed Freight Vehicle 1 (HSFV1) is one of the most significant railway vehicles of the modern age.,Although it’s a freight wagon, research carried out on the rail-wheel interface with this vehicle actually had a major impact on the development of high speed passenger rail travel. In the UK it led to the development of the Advanced Passenger Train (which for political as much as technological reasons wasn’t a great success) and also the InterCity 125
High Speed Trains
which are still in service today. Many railways across the world use the technology originally developed by HSFV1, which you can see on display at
Locomotion
in County Durham.,Other items we’ve collected this year include

NASA’s Parker Solar Probe
hurtled past the Sun at a speed of 343,000 kilometres per hour, simultaneously breaking the record for the closest human-made object to the Sun and the fastest human-made object in history.,This is the first of 24 flybys that Parker will make during its seven-year mission to unlock the secrets of our closest star. At these close quarters intense solar radiation will heat the Sun-facing side of the spacecraft to a blistering 440 degrees Celsius, with Parker’s delicate instruments protected by an 11-centimetre-thick carbon composite heat shield.,The mission operations team at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory lost contact with Parker a few days ago, as transmissions to and from Earth were overwhelmed by the Sun’s powerful radio emissions. For the next few days Parker will be fully autonomous, with its onboard systems constantly monitoring and adjusting the spacecraft’s orientation to keep the heat shield pointed squarely at the Sun. Even a brief misalignment allowing sunlight to fall on the unshielded parts of the craft could spell disaster. It will be a nervous wait for Parker to re-establish communications once it emerges from the Sun’s radio blackout.,Parker is currently flying through the Sun’s corona – the tenuous halo of plasma that surrounds the Sun with a temperature of around 2 million degrees. Fortunately, these fantastically high temperatures don’t pose a threat to the spacecraft as the corona is also fantastically thin. Parker’s instruments will now be sampling and probing this never-before-visited region of the Sun’s atmosphere, capturing data on its particle-content and magnetic field. One of the many questions Parker is trying to answer is why the corona has such a high temperature, while the surface of the Sun sits at a comparatively balmy 5500 degrees Celsius.,Over the next seven years Parker will use repeated flybys of the planet Venus to trim its orbit ever closer to the Sun. Today the probe passed the Sun at a distance of 24 million kilometres, but at the climax of the mission in December 2024 this will be reduced to just 6 million kilometres, 4% of the distance between the Earth and the Sun. If all goes well, Parker promises to transform our understanding of our local star while also improving our ability to forecast solar storms, which pose an increasing threat to the satellite and electrical systems that we all rely on.,Learn more about humanity’s relationship with our nearest star in

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/the-1860-solar-eclipse/,Oliver Carpenter,The 1860 Solar Eclipse,"Curator of our recent exhibition The Sun: Living With Our Star, Dr Oliver Carpenter, takes a look back to the most important eclipse of the nineteenth century. ",Exhibitions and Galleries,"astronomy,photography,physics,space,the sun","As the Sun is eclipsed, mysterious red flames burn brightly at the edge of the Moon. What are these ‘prominences’? Where do they come from? Why can they only be seen during a total eclipse of the Sun? Setting sail in the borrowed Royal Navy troopship HMS Himalaya, the chemist, astronomer and gentleman-adventurer Warren de La Rue (1815-1889) had these questions in mind. The date was 7 July 1860, eleven days before the most important solar eclipse of the nineteenth century.,His mission: to settle one of the most hotly (no pun intended) debated astronomical questions of the day: what are the mysterious, tentacular limbs that appear beyond the edge of the Moon during an eclipse? Are these prominences features of the Moon? Are they disturbances from within the Earth’s atmosphere? Or are they a part of the Sun normally obscured by its dazzling glare?,As the eclipse-hunter de la Rue sailed out from Plymouth Harbour, he knew he had the best chance yet of answering these questions, for he had a powerful new tool at his disposal – the
Kew photoheliograph
.,Half telescope, half camera, and designed by de la Rue himself, it was the first instrument made specifically to photograph the Sun. This was also the first occasion where its use might allow a scientific problem in astronomy to be resolved using photography.,Armed with his new device, an entire photographic laboratory – four assistants, interpreters and porters – along with the staffs’ wives, children and a sense of Victorian scientific purpose, de la Rue sailed through the Bay of Biscay to Bilbao in Northern Spain. Continuing to the small Basque Country village of Rivabellosa, the party set up their observatory, their flat-pack photo studio and their camp, and waited.,A cloudy sky on the morning of 18 July 1860 threatened to scupper the whole expedition, but fortunately the skies cleared just in time. With the Kew photoheliograph in position and poised for action, the edge of the Sun started to disappear behind the Moon.,De la Rue and his team took over 40 photographs, including two precious shots of totality. With an exposure time in these dimmed conditions of one minute, they were lucky to capture even one.,For the first time in history, and in de la Rue’s own words, these precious photographs ‘depicted the luminous prominences with a precision as to contour and position impossible of attainment by eye observations’. Here, then, was the breakthrough. Never before had humans seen these strange and beautiful features with such accuracy.,But the question still remained: were these of terrestrial, lunar or solar origin? In other words, were they part of the Earth’s atmosphere, something around the edge of the Moon, or did they emanate 93 million miles away from the Sun itself? A relatively simple way to settle the matter would be to compare photographs of the eclipse from two different locations. If prominences were Earth or Moon-based, the observations from different sites ought to differ, but if prominences were solar in origin, they should match.,Happily, an Italian Jesuit astronomer named Father Angelo Secchi had established his own observation post a few hundred miles to the south, and he managed to capture some half-decent shots of his own of the Sun at eclipse. Not as clear as those taken using the Kew photoheliograph, these images were just sufficient for the job. By comparing his own shots with those of Secchi’s, de la Rue established that the features observed were identical on each.,The greatest astronomical question of the age had been answered – the prominences were indeed features of the Sun. Moreover, the solution had come from photography.,De la Rue and the Kew photoheliograph had shown that luminous prominences invisible to the naked eye could be captured in photographs – setting the standard for all future devices. Since the famous eclipse expedition of 1860, photography has been the primary tool of astronomers as they seek to unravel the secrets of our nearest star.,The
Kew photoheliograph

It was back in 1990 that scientists at NASA first began to discuss sending a probe to the Sun. The team have had to overcome enormous technical challenges as well as cancellations, delays and budget issues to finally be at a point where they can deliver this once in a generation mission. There are sure to be some very nervous people watching Saturday morning as their precious spacecraft gets blasted into space on top of tens of thousands of tons of highly explosive rocket fuel.,Despite being the largest and brightest object in the sky, there is still a lot we don’t understand about our Sun. Why does the corona – the ghostly halo of light that becomes visible around the Sun during a total eclipse – have a temperature of millions of degrees Celsius when the surface of the Sun is at only 5730 degrees? How is the solar wind – the stream of charged particles that constantly buffets the Earth – accelerated into space?,Perhaps the most significant issue that Parker will help to address is the threat posed to human activity by solar storms. Despite its tranquil appearance from the surface of the Earth, the Sun is a dynamic and often violent body, sporadically firing vast clouds of charged particles into space.,These ‘coronal mass ejections’ have the power to knock out satellites and power grids, if we were unlucky enough for one to hit the Earth. Improving our understanding of these solar storms is essential in
predicting when they might occur
and in giving more warning of an impending storm to the people who run our power, transport and communications networks. Parker will measure the origins of these solar storms right at source, providing crucial data.,In fact, forecasting solar storms is something you can get involved in. The Science Museum recently launched a new citizen science project with solar scientists at the University of Reading. If you follow this
link
to the Zooniverse site, you can help scientists decide which coronal mass ejections look the most dangerous and ultimately improve our ability to predict and forecast space weather.,The engineering challenges faced by the Parker team have been enormous. The spacecraft will fly closer to the Sun than any before, coming within 4% of the distance between the Earth and the Sun. At such close quarters the intense sunlight will heat Parker to a searing 1377 degrees Celsius, hot enough to melt steel.,If Parker’s delicate instruments were exposed to this fearsome light they would be destroyed instantly, and so the entire spacecraft is hunkered down behind a super-advanced heat shield made of a carbon-carbon composite, which will keep the rest of the spacecraft at a balmy 29 degrees Celsius.,In fact, Parker will come so close to the Sun that it can’t carry any telescopes that look directly at the Sun – they would melt! Instead, instruments behind the heat shield will measure and sample the particles in the solar wind and the magnetic field, while a specially designed telescope will look sideways out of the craft to image the solar wind as it flows away from the Sun.,Saturday marks the beginning of a long journey that will take Parker ever closer to our nearest star. While most spacecraft try to increase their speed to escape the Sun’s gravity, Parker actually needs to slow itself down compared to the Earth so that the Sun’s gravity can take hold and pull Parker in. In late September, Parker will fly past Venus, and use the planet’s gravity to slow down the speed of its orbit. From here, Parker will literally fall towards the Sun, making its first closest approach on 3 November.,This first flyby of the Sun, or ‘perihelion’, will be a real moment of drama for the mission team, who will be waiting expectantly for the first data to be returned from close to the Sun (and also to see if their spacecraft survives the encounter). Over the next seven years, Parker will use flybys of Venus to repeatedly fall further and further towards the Sun, reaching its closest approach on 21 December 2024.,At this point, the Sun’s gravitational pull will have accelerated Parker to a whopping 700,000 kilometres per hour – that’s fast enough to travel from London to Manchester in one second – making Parker the fastest manmade object in history.,The launch of the Parker Solar Probe marks the beginning of an exciting new chapter in our exploration of the Sun. Following hot on its heels in early 2020 will be the European Space Agency’s Solar Orbiter, which will carry a suite of telescopes to provide stunning new imagery of the Sun as the spacecraft soars high above the plane of the Solar System to view its north and south poles. Solar Orbiter will work in tandem with the Parker Solar Probe to transform our understanding of our local star, as humankind reaches out to touch the Sun for the very first time.,Learn more about humanity’s relationship with our nearest star in

The Sun: Living With Our Star
, was launched by the Science Museum in October 2018 to shed new light on the power, beauty and dark side of our neighbourhood star.,From early Nordic Bronze Age artefacts that reveal ancient beliefs of how the Sun was transported across the sky, to details of forthcoming solar missions, this exhibition charted humankind’s dependence upon and ever-changing understanding of our local fusion reactor.,Highlights from the Science Museum collection included an astronomical spectroscope made for Norman Lockyer – who campaigned for the founding of the Science Museum – who used it to reveal helium in the Sun’s atmosphere in 1868.,The exhibition coincided with the 150th anniversary of Lockyer’s discovery, the first of an “extra-terrestrial” element, as helium had not yet been found on Earth. Also on display was the original orrery, a mechanical model of the Solar System, made for the Earl of Orrery in 1712.,At the press launch, Chairman of the Board of Trustees, Dame Mary Archer, wearing a ‘Hello Solar’ t-shirt, congratulated the recent Nobel Prize Winners, including Donna Strickland, the third woman to win the Nobel Prize for physics, and Frances Arnold, the fifth woman to be awarded the prize for chemistry.,During the celebrations that night, where the Philharmonia Orchestra performed the finale of Respighi’s Pines of Rome, Ian Blatchford, Director of the Science Museum, said, ‘Since people first looked up at the sky the Sun has been a source of fascination, awe and inspiration.’,‘The fact that the Sun has had such a profound influence on the way we live makes it an incredibly rich subject for an exhibition, crossing huge expanses of time and place’, added Dr Harry Cliff, Lead Curator, adding ‘the subject is increasingly relevant for the way we live now, from the threat of solar storms to the upcoming space missions that will allow humankind to touch the Sun for the first time.’,Jim Bridenstine, NASA Administrator, said: ‘Over the last several decades NASA and researchers from around the world have harnessed space technologies to bring us closer to understanding our star than ever before. I am delighted that the UK’s Science Museum’s new exhibition,

Brooklands
, the world’s first purpose-built motor-racing circuit. In its day, it was a thrill-seeker’s dream, but ordinary folk could go along for a test-drive too. Ninety years ago, you might just have caught a glimpse of one of these little beauties powering up the banking:,The ABC ‘Skootamota’ was one of the earliest motor scooters (as the name suggests). Introduced in 1919, the lightweight and extremely simple Skootamota was cheap, reliable and easy to store.  We got ours in 1948 from a Lt. Cdr. Eve. Our curator took this lovely atmospheric shot of the vehicle when he went to inspect it at Eve’s house.,The designer, Granville Bradshaw, invited writers from
Motor Cycling
magazine to join him on the 1919 Brooklands test-ride. The journalists were highly impressed, both with the scooter’s cruising speed (15 – 20 miles per hour), and its ability to climb the Brooklands Test Hill, with its 1-in-4 gradient.,“While we never dreamed for a moment that it would make the slightest headway on the very stiff gradients, much to our surprise the Scooter proved itself capable of going about two-thirds of the way up the slope, and it was only on the steepest portion that it was brought to rest!”,If you think the seat looks a bit, well, rudimentary, that’s because it was only there for long-distance riding. Most of the time, riders would stand on the platform. At a flat-out speed of 25mph, it would have been quite a ride!"

looked a bit rudimentary to your sophisticated, yet jaded, twenty-first-century eyes. Perhaps you’d like more comfort, more protection from the nasty winter weather. If that’s the case, let me present to you the
Ner-a-car
.,It was designed in America after the First World War by Carl Neracher, and was a motorbike built for comfort – just like a car, in fact. The name was a rather forced play on that of its designer, and the fact that it was ‘nearly a car’ (geddit?). If the Skootamota was simple and stripped-down, the Ner-a-car was by contrast the height of two-wheeled luxury.,Built in Britain by
Sheffield Simplex
, the Ner-a-car was noted for being exceptionally stable. Some said you could ride it ‘hands-off’ (see
this
Classic Bike Guide feature). It was a lovely ride, but seemed perhaps too unusual for 1920s roads. The firm stopped making them in about 1926, and few survive (ours is in store at
Wroughton
).,One advertisement stated that ‘you need have no fear of skidding or soiled clothing, nor wear special overalls.’ For this reason, it was ‘equally suitable for both sexes’. With its weather-protection (owing to the huge mudguards) it was quite a hit amongst doctors and midwives who needed to look presentable in all weathers.

3.7 °C

Anders Celsius
began conducting experiments aimed at devising a
scientific, international temperature scale
.,At the start of the 1700s, temperature was measured in inches of mercury or alcohol, up and down from arbitrary zero points. In 1724 the German natural philosopher Daniel Fahrenheit proposed a
scale based on three points
, which set the melting point of water at 32 degrees. A number of  rival scales also came into use.,Celsius recognised that a common,
international temperature scale
would be useful for scientific purposes. He first conducted experiments to confirm how the freezing and boiling points of water varied with latitude and altitude. He then selected these as his fixed reference points and placed 100 gradations between them. A little known fact: in 1742 Celsius originally defined
zero degrees
on his Centigrade scale as the
boiling point
of water and
100 degrees

You may be able to figure out how it works just from looking at it…,The idea is that the glass ball acts as a lens, focusing the sun’s rays onto an area within the wooden cup and scorching it. As the sun travels from east to west across the sky it burns an arc shape into the wooden bowl, indicating the duration and approximate intensity of sunshine for the day. A single wooden bowl can be used for six months, since every day the sun is slightly higher (leading up to mid summer) or lower (leading up to mid winter) in the sky, so it leaves a separate trace. Simple – but effective.,Campbell’s design was refined by the Cambridge Professor
George Gabriel Stokes
. Stokes devised a stand, into which special cards are inserted every day to serve as the recording part of the apparatus. This gives more accuracy than the simple wooden bowl.,The
Met Office
still use Campbell-Stokes sunshine recorders today to measure hours of sunshine, although these are gradually being replaced by electronic instruments.,Anyway, enough talk of measuring sunshine. Time to sit back and enjoy it!"

hottest day of the year so far
on Sunday? It got me thinking about
what else
we have in the collection relating to temperature.
For simplicity, I like this modern reconstruction of an apparatus which
Philo of Byzantium
devised back in 200 – 100 BC to indicate temperature change. A hollow, lead globe is attached to a tube, which is bent over into a container of water. You can probably guess what happens when the globe is warmed…,Philo explained:,I assert that when the globe is placed in the sun and becomes warm, some of the air enclosed in the tube will pass out … into the water, setting it in motion and producing air bubbles, one after the other. If the globe be placed in the shade … then the water will rise through the tube and flow into the globe.,Some seventeen or so centuries later Philo’s idea was revisited, leading to the invention of the
air thermoscope
. The Italian physician
Santorio Santorio
was one of several Europeans working on it simultaneously.,Santorio’s instrument is in two parts. The glass bulb and tube are heated to expel some air, and the end of the tube is inverted into the narrow vessel containing water. As the air inside the bulb cools it contracts, drawing liquid up into the tube.  Once it has been set up, the changing water level indicates rising and falling temperature.,Santorio later put a scale on the thermoscope, creating the first air thermometer.  The air thermometer was supplanted by the more familiar liquid-in-glass thermometer from the 1640s. More on that another time."

th
would be the coldest day of the coming year. The day duly arrived and bitter cold confirmed the prediction. Booksellers were besieged by hordes of people demanding copies of
Murphy’s Weather Almanac
, which contained predictions for the whole year based on planetary and lunar influences. Murphy made his name as a
weather prophet
and a small fortune too, but he didn’t escape criticism.,To some, astrological almanacs simply betrayed the credulity of the British public. However in the 19th century ‘scientific’ and ‘non-scientific’ understandings of weather were not clearly distinguished.,Take Robert Fitzroy. Better known as the captain of
HMS
Beagle
, the fellow of the Royal Society headed the newly formed Meteorological Department of the Board of Trade (later the Meteorological Office) from 1854. Fitzroy was no astrologist but he did speculate that the moon influenced atmospheric conditions. And many shared his hope that, with sufficient data, predicting the weather might one day become as reliable as predicting the motions of the heavens.,Fitzroy’s Department had two aims: collecting ‘accurate and digested observations for the future use of men of science’ and, more practically, aiding navigation. Fitzroy supplied instruments and charts to ships’ Captains, who in return sent meteorological data back to London. He also loaned barometers to coastal villages to help fishermen plan their work safely.,Using telegraphy, Fitzroy gathered daily reports from a growing network of British and European observers. From 1861 he used this data to produce the first ‘forecasts’, which were printed in the newspapers. They were eagerly consumed. However, some members of the scientific establishment worried that they blurred the boundaries between elite and popular forms of knowledge making.,In 1866, following Fitzroy’s death, an official report found that “the truth of [Fitzroy’s forecasts] is warranted neither by science nor by experience”. Like Murphy’s almanac, they caused the public “to confuse real knowledge with ill founded pretences” and threatened the reputation of “true science”.  Against considerable resistance, the service was cancelled and for a time weather prediction was left to the successors of Patrick Murphy and his fellow weather prophets."

Queen Mary’s Hospital
, Roehampton, which opened 95 years ago this month.,The date is significant. By 1915, the trickle of amputees shipped home to Britain in the early weeks of the First World War was becoming a torrent. The authorities, who were obliged to provide them with artificial limbs, were soon overwhelmed. The new hospital was a response to this crisis.,As the War progressed, St Mary’s became the main focus of
limb production and fitting

Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin
was awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry, on 10 December, 1964.,Hodgkin won the prestigious prize “for her determinations by X-ray techniques of the structures of important biochemical substances”. She was only the third woman to win the prestigious prize – the crowning achievement of a 30 year career spent unraveling the structures of proteins, including insulin.,Hodgkin first found fame when she finally solved the structure of penicillin on Victory in Europe Day in 1945.,Alexander Fleming
had identified the anti-bacterial properties of penicillium mould in 1928 but thought the substance was too unstable to isolate as a drug. At Oxford University
Howard Florey, Ernst Chain
and
Norman Heatley
proved otherwise and successfully purified the antibiotic for human use in 1941.,Once the potential was realised, vast amounts of the drug were needed. Chain spoke of his excitement and challenged Hodgkin to find its structure, promising ‘One day we will have crystals for you.’,Penicillin saved many lives during the Second World War. Allied governments recognised the potential of the ‘wonder drug’ and the race was on to convert a laboratory discovery into a mass- produced drug.,Hodgkin unravelled the structure of penicillin using a method called
X-ray crystallography
– a technique used to identify the structure of molecules. Hodgkin had been fascinated by crystals from a young age and on her sixteenth birthday received a book about using X-rays to analyse crystals, which greatly inspired her.,Hodgkin’s
three dimensional atomic structure of penicillin
is part of the Science Museum Group’s collection.,Another notable molecular structure Hodgkin tackled was that of vitamin B12, which she cracked with the help of Alan Turing’s
Pilot ACE computer
, which is on display in our
Information Age
gallery.,These achievements had an immense impact on chemistry, biochemistry and medical science, establishing the power of X-ray crystallography, and changing the practice of synthetic chemistry.,She was one of the first people in April 1953 to travel from Oxford to Cambridge to see the model of the
double helix structure of DNA
, constructed by Briton Francis Crick and American James Watson, based on data acquired by Rosalind Franklin, which can also be seen in the museum’s
Making the Modern World
gallery.,Hodgkin was awarded the
Order of Merit
, only the second woman to be honoured in this way after Florence Nightingale. She was also the first woman to be awarded the Royal Society’s
Copley medal
, its oldest and most prestigious award.,She died in July 1994, aged 84. In her honour, the Royal Society established the prestigious
Dorothy Hodgkin Fellowship
for early career stage researchers.,The origins of the technique she used date back to when
X-rays
, one of the most remarkable discoveries of the late 19th century, had been shown to react strangely when exposed to crystals, producing patterns of spots on a photographic plate.,This post was written by Rachel Boon, Content Developer for Churchill’s Scientists, a 2015 exhibition at the Science Museum."

It’s part of a consignment of plastic toys lost from a container ship in the North Pacific during high storms on January 10, 1992. Around 29,000 toys spilled from the container and have been making a swim for it ever since, to the shores of Alaska, surviving ice in the Bering Straits, and heading into the North Atlantic.,Oceanographers
Curtis Ebbesmeyer and James Ingraham
have enlisted the help of beachcombers worldwide to track where the toys wash up. By following the mighty ducks and their floating friends, they can refine their models of ocean surface currents. It’s a great illustration of how scientists can come up with imaginative solutions to problems, and a charming example of members of the public working in tandem with scientists. Oceanographers track all sorts of flotsam – there’s also a flotilla of trainers bobbing about out there – but the storytelling potential of rubber duckies floating around the world’s biggest bathtub makes this case particularly appealing. You can find out more about Curtis and the ducks in his
book
.,These toys are part of the first wave to be washed ashore – large numbers landed in
Sitka, Alaska
, ten months after the spill. We acquired these toys in 2005, following a response to posts we put on Sitka community websites under the heading ‘Science Museum, London, looking for a duck!’  We decided they should travel to the Museum in a box, by air, rather than swimming for it…"

Great Scott

Apollo 15 mission

EVA
(Extra Vehicular Activity, which in this case combined Moonwalking with driving the lunar rover) which Scott performed with his crewmate, the late
Jim Irwin
when they collected this and other lunar specimens.,What gradually started to dawn on me was really, I mean REALLY how old the Moon is. How dead it is. How it’s blasted and pummelled landscape reflects hundreds of thousands of millennia of volcanic bombardment from within and meteoroid attack from without. Scott and Irwin drove, bounced and clumped over the dust and debris of eons.,The Great Scott rock had probably lain there where the astronaut found it for millions of years – since before humans became human. It was formed over 3 billion years ago – when life was little more than scatterings of single cells.,If our night-sky neighbour could think, he might have wondered what these upstart beings were up to – late arrivals at the party and already getting restless."

Perhaps because it is so grounded in the ‘Dimension of Imagination’, a term coined by Rod Serling the creator of the seminal science fiction TV series, ‘The Twilight Zone’.,Yet we should ask ourselves who really sent the first humans to the moon; was it the work of the extensive team of NASA scientists behind one of our species’ most inspirational achievements, or the seed planted by Jules Verne in his 1865 novel ‘From the Earth to the Moon’ which is known to have been an influence to both Astronaut and Cosmonaut alike in the Space Race of the 1960s?,Science can determine the “how”. It’s a land grab for knowledge by which we seek a better and, perhaps one day, complete understanding of the universe. However, science rarely can deliver the “why?” The unsatisfying response of; “because we can” is not enough.,Humanity cannot advance as a species through science alone. We need to assess the impact on the adventure of each and every step we take. We must consider both the blue sky and the clouds on the horizon.,The potential hazards of our own creations have been explored as far back as Mary Shelley in her ‘
Frankenstein
‘ (1818) through to the countless dystopian scenarios currently on offer (why not take your pick from a fine selection of doomsday scenarios?). It’s often those unshackled by scientific discipline that arrive at the consequences faster than the scientific pioneers breaking new ground.,It’s not that Science Fiction authors are Luddites – far from it. Writers such as Ursula Le Guin wrote powerfully about the utopian potential of “new technology”.,Indeed, many a scientist has a proven command of the imagination such as Isaac Asimov (who held a Ph.D. in chemistry), Arthur C. Clarke (in 1945, he proposed that geostationary satellites would be ideal for telecommunications relays), Michael Crichton, Robert A. Heinlein, Fred Hoyle and Carl Sagan all of whom had strong academic credentials and conducted research often in parallel with their creative work.,The work of Science Fiction authors continues to win the respect it deserves, as recognised when Octavia Butler became the first Science Fiction author to win a MacArthur ‘Genius Grant’ in 1995.,Science Fiction can offer direction – targets to aim for by scientists, be that the conquest of space or the creation of all our mod cons. Motorola’s Martin Cooper led the team that developed the world’s first handheld 800 MHz mobile phone prototype in 1973. Cooper later admitted that watching Captain Kirk using his communicator on ‘Star Trek’ inspired him.,Perhaps more importantly, the genre also serves as our very own “Jiminy Cricket”. It is the health warning on the side of the very packet that scientific research comes in. A moral compass to be ignored at our peril. Case in point, the consequences of Artificial Intelligence as explored half a century ago by Clark and Stanley Kubrick in ‘
2001: A Space Odyssey
‘ (1968).,Like Shelley’s ‘Frankenstein’ 150 years earlier, the HAL 9000 highlights man’s hubris in creating Artificial Intelligence whilst our species still has a primitive understanding of its own.,The imagination is a realm as important to explore and understand as the “final frontier” or deep sea exploration. It’s an essential part of our existence, of our physiological and psychological make up…and just why we were designed with that capacity is insoluble to man or machine. At least right now.,And that brings us to ‘The Twilight Zone’, now in its 60th year with the acclaimed stage production currently playing at London’s Ambassador’s Theatre until 1 June. It remains perhaps the most influential TV series in American history – continuing to inspire the great and good in literature, film, TV and now stage.,The new stage production celebrates the pioneering work of Serling, the show’s creator and host, as well as two of his closest collaborators, Richard Matheson and Charles Beaumont. It brings together director Richard Jones (the recent recipient of his 8th Olivier Award) with New York playwright Anne Washburn. Even the use of magic and illusion in the show calls on the scientific mind with Richard Wiseman (who holds a Professorship in the Public Understanding of Psychology at the University of Hertfordshire) and Will Houstoun providing their skills to make the impossible probable.,The show offers daily departures right into the epicenter of the imagination (well except for Sundays).

antimatter
, dark matter and dark energy (mysterious sources of gravity and anti-gravity which make up 95 percent of the universe), at the cost of just ‘one cappuccino/year per European citizen’ (that is 1.2 billion Swiss Francs per year).,Perhaps the best-known recent example of fundamental science to emerge from the laboratory is the

Heston Blumenthal
,
ESA astronaut Tim Peake
enjoyed the first
bacon sarnie
to ever be consumed in space.,This might not seem like much of an accomplishment, however, creating bread and other types of food for consumption in space is harder than you might think.,Since the first space flight,
space food
has improved and evolved dramatically from bread pieces coated in gelatine and
freeze-dried cubes
, to food paste in squeeze-tubes, to meals heated up and eaten with cutlery.,The
space food from Tim Peake’s trip
to the
International Space Station
represents a unique addition to the space food development story, and so we recently acquired these seven dishes for the
Science Museum Group Collection
.,Space agencies largely view food as a survival tool. It is essential that each astronaut consume the right amount of nutrients and calories each day to stay healthy in space. The food must also be light-weight, compact and last for at least a year and a half.,Heston Blumenthal, however, decided to take on the challenge of producing delicious food that could be safely consumed in space. Luckily for Tim Peake, Blumenthal picked his
2015-2016 Principia
mission to give it a go.,A big part of Blumenthal’s challenge was to create appetising food when it cannot be cooked or refrigerated. All food must be prepared in advance and either sealed in a tin, a pouch or freeze dried.,Each astronaut gets a ‘bonus food’ allowance to help boost morale. Normally this is chosen from a menu, however, Blumenthal specially created
seven recipes
for Peake’s ‘bonus food’ supply.,Blumenthal’s task was to make food that fit the stringent ESA criteria, while also making it taste, look and smell better. Astronauts’ meals are a key factor in the emotional and mental well-being of the astronaut. This was also part of a larger effort by Blumenthal to illustrate the impact that food can have even in the harshest of environments.,Blumenthal set out to create recipes that would remind Peake of his family and his home. Extensive experiments were completed by Blumenthal and his team to try and create the best recipes.,He created food in zero-gravity conditions, monitored salt thresholds, acidity, sweetness and moisture migration. He tested Peake’s taste parameters to understand exactly what he likes and dislikes.,The team had to overcome obstacles such as the liquid released by the onions in the
Sausage Sizzle
dish. Liquid in tinned food over a certain percentage is prohibited in space because it encourages microbial growth.,Bread and sandwiches are also frowned upon, particularly after US astronaut John Young snuck a
corned beef sandwich into space
, only to have crumbs and bits of corned beef floating about the ISS after the first bite, potentially putting the instrument panels at risk.,Blumenthal, however, found that if a dense piece of bread with the crust removed is cooked in a tin, it is free of crumbs.,Thus, Blumenthal created the bacon sarnie for Tim Peake to enjoy – the first one ever to be eaten in space!,Why not try some space food for yourself?

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/11-things-you-might-not-know-about-tim-peakes-spacesuit/,Doug Millard,11 things you might not know about Tim Peake’s spacesuit,This is the Sokol KV-2 emergency spacesuit worn by British ESA Astronaut Tim Peake as he traveled into space. ,"Collections and Objects,Science in the news","exploration,helen sharman,science museum group,space,tim peake","Strap in as we share 11 facts about this remarkable space survival system:,1. The
Sokol KV-2 emergency suit
is worn by cosmonauts (and astronauts) during launches to the International Space Station and the return to Earth.,,2. The Sokol suit (Sokol is the Russian word for Falcon) was developed by the RD&PE Zvezda company following the loss of the three-cosmonaut crew of Soyuz 11 in 1971. The crew were not wearing spacesuits when their spacecraft depressurised during its return to Earth.,3. Designed to prevent a repeat of the Soyuz 11 tragedy, the suit was introduced in 1973 to keep cosmonauts alive in the event of accidental depressurisation. The first version was the Sokol-K, The ‘K’ stands for Космос, the Russian word for space.,,4. Zvezda modified its high-altitude aviation suit to create the Sokol and ready it for spaceflight. Rigid, removable helmets were replaced by softer, built-in ones. This and other adjustments made the Sokol more comfortable and enabled near-instant sealing of the suit when the helmet visor was closed.,5. The suit is made up of a rubberised internal bladder and a rigid external coat. The bladder provides an airtight seal (using an elastic band) and the external coat is made mostly from the temperature-stable insulator Kapton to provide protection from mechanical and thermal impact.,﻿,6. Every Soyuz crew member is provided with a made-to-measure suit. It’s vital that it fits properly—each cosmonaut spends an hour in a launch seat with the suit inflated to make sure it fits. Arm, leg and chest straps allow the suit to be adjusted.,7. To get into the
Sokol suit
, two zips that form a ‘V’ on the chest are opened. Underneath, there is an opening in the internal rubberised bladder known as the
appendix
. Legs go in first, followed by the arms into the sleeves and head into the helmet.,,An airtight seal is made by tightly rolling up the appendix and securing it with elastic bands. This is fastened under the V-shaped flap in the suit’s outer layer. The suit’s detachable gloves are secured with anodised aluminium bayonet fixings.,8. The suit’s polycarbonate visor opens on hinges mounted near the ears and seals with an anodised aluminium clavicle flange when closed. The hood or ‘soft helmet’ folds up when the visor is raised.,,9. Boots are worn only during the walk to the Soyuz spacecraft, to protect the feet of the suit from damage. Cosmonauts often carry children’s toys and gifts in them for luck, then take the boots off to avoid trailing debris into the spacecraft.,10. Once the astronaut/cosmonaut is in the
Soyuz spacecraft
, electrical and air supply lines and hoses are connected to the lower abdomen section of the suit. Connected to the spacecraft’s life support systems, the Sokol suit provides two hours of oxygen and carbon-dioxide removal if the spacecraft cabin depressurises.,11. The
Sokol suit
is contoured for the Soyuz spacecraft seats, which require cosmonauts to draw their knees up into a foetal position. This shape causes the ‘cosmonaut stoop’, seen when cosmonauts are walking to the Soyuz spacecraft.,Tim’s
Sokol KV-2 emergency spacesuit
is now on display at the
Museum of Science and Industry
in Manchester where it can be seen with the
Soyuz spacecraft
Tim travelled in as part of The National Tour of Tim Peake’s Spacecraft presented by Samsung and the Science Museum Group.,This is not the first spacesuit to join the
Science Museum Group Collection
. We also care for
Helen Sharman’s Sokol spacesuit
(currently on display in the museum’s
Exploring Space
gallery). Sharman was the first Briton in space and wore her suit while travelling to and from the Russian Mir space station in 1991."

Association of Space Explorers
.,In our IMAX theatre, Helen described the fairy tale story of how in 1989 she, then a food technologist, answered an advertisement on her car radio: “Astronaut wanted. No experience necessary.”,She was eventually selected from over 13,000 applicants and spent 18 months training in Star City before being launched on 18 May 1991.,She told me how it took two days to get to the Mir space station, how she smuggled an orange aboard, the ‘wonderful time’ she had in orbit (despite the moment the space station lost air circulation), and her tips on becoming an astronaut.,What mission would tempt her to put
her spacesuit
back on? ‘I’d go on anything.’,We were then joined on the IMAX stage by astronauts from across Europe: Franz Viehböck; Reinhold Ewald; Michel Tognini; Jean-Francois Clervoy; Claudie Haigneré; Dumitru Prunariu; Bertalan Farkas; Aleksandar Aleksandrov; Ernst Messerschmid; Jean-Pierre Haigneré; and Jean-Loup Chretien.,Among the many highlights: Dumitru Prunariu, a veteran of Salyut 6, described the work of the Association of Space Explorers; Bertalan Farkas recalled a remarkable 45g landing; Jean-Francois Clervoy, veteran of the Hubble repair mission, described what it feels like to cycle at 7 km/s;  Michel Tognini recounted serious problems encountered during the ascent of the Columbia space shuttle; Claudie Haigneré shared her dreams of a ‘moon village;’  Ernst Messerschmid talked about space tourism, and Franz Viehböck emphasised the importance of school in training future spacefarers.,There was also a tribute to Helen from
Buzz Aldrin and Prof Brian Cox

.,Space missions capture the imagination. They turn people on to science. They broaden our horizons too. I can hardly believe that it has been 25 years since I played my small part in this great adventure, the next phase of human exploration.,My journey into space began in 1989 after I had answered an advertisement on my car radio: “Astronaut wanted. No experience necessary.” With Timothy Mace, I was eventually selected from over 13,000 applicants to represent the British Juno Mission and we spent 18 months training in Star City.,,Times were hard in the Soviet Union in the early 90s. I did not have an office. Nor did I have a car for most of the time. Phone calls to the UK had to be booked with a Russian operator days in advance and were returned any time within a window of a few hours. If we disconnected, I had to book a call and wait a few more days.,My life was so remote that leaning Russian became my greatest priority and challenge, one that I tackled with the help of Igor Merkulov, my teacher. Last year, with the help of the Science Museum, we had a reunion in Star City. It was wonderful as if we had never been apart since my training. Even though he is now 84 years old, he was able to join me and we gossiped. Or at least I tried to in my broken, rusty Russian.,The centrifuge (for g-force experience) and hydro tank (for spacewalk training) were undergoing refurbishment when I visited but we did see the Soyuz and Mir simulators, alongside displays of a docking mechanism, space food, a space toilet, and a dreaded spinning chair. I had been lucky that my physiology is well suited to space training.,While being spun round, the poor trainee has to move their head from side to side and forwards and backward. Many feel nauseous and have to endure the chair regularly to build up stamina, which reduces the chance of them being space-sick. I was lucky, an outlier. Most people last five or so minutes to start with. I lasted 15 my first time around without batting an eyelid! The centrifuge was not a big deal for me either. Perhaps the greatest discomfort I suffered was doing tests in an
off the shelf spacesuit
, which was suited to fit a man.,I was eventually launched on 18 May 1991 in Soyuz TM-12 along with the Soviet cosmonauts Anatoly (‘Tole’) Artsebarsky and Sergei Krikalev. Our time in orbit was calm and focused – perhaps even laid back. When the batteries failed soon after we docked with the Mir Space Station, plunging us into darkness, another crew member, Viktor Afanasyev, simply shrugged and said: “we thought that might happen.”,From orbit, our planet is uncannily blue. You can’t imagine how deep the colour is, and the scale and details that you can discern, from the sweep of a continent to the wake of a ship. At night, the lights of cities shine up to you and you can see the dance of the aurora.,After eight days I returned to Earth with Viktor and Musa Manarov. Re-entry, at more than five times Earth’s gravity (5.5 g), was much more dramatic than the launch, where we only experienced 3.5g.,As we came through the atmosphere, I could see the ball of plasma around our descent module go orange and then yellow, before the windows were eventually blacked out by soot from the spacecraft. When the drogue chute pulled out the main parachute we jolted from side to side. I was shocked by the violence of the re-entry. After the retrorockets fired, we tumbled a few times before being left hanging inside, as the spacecraft came to a rest on its side.,During our reunion in Star City, we were joined by my commander, Tole, who had travelled out with me from Moscow. While we were standing underneath the Mir simulator, my old doctor, Vladimir Krivalapov, also turned up. Vladimir is now deputy head of the medical section for cosmonauts but when we first met he was assigned to the British Mission. Our encounter last year was the first time we had met in 24 years. Viktor Afanasev also joined us. I was fortunate that he had postponed a hospital visit (a few years ago, Viktor had a serious car accident and one of his legs was still in a cage).,Tole had brought with him traditional gifts of champagne and sweets and we toasted our friendship, our reunion, and we could easily pick up where we had left things after travelling together to space. Astronauts and cosmonauts are chosen for being gregarious, without being party animals, for their stable temperament, without being depressive or highly strung, and for their exceptional ability to get on.,,Before
Tim Peake was launched last December
to the International Space Station, he asked if there was anything I would like him to take. I gave Tim my copy of Road to the Stars by Yuri Gagarin – which I had taken into orbit, so the crew of the ISS could add their signatures alongside those of my Mir crewmates.,We will have to work more closely together than ever before if we are to succeed in the next generation of space exploration. The next great objective is the one that Soviets dreamt about at the very start of human spaceflight with Gagarin’s launch in 1961: Mars. Would I like to join them in a mission to the red planet? If I knew I could return, I would do it in an instant."

It is a haunting sight, especially when you learn Leonov did not think he would be able to climb back inside the spaceship.",Exhibitions and Galleries,"alexei leonov,cosmonauts,space,yuri gagarin","Leonov
, who celebrates his 80
th
birthday today (May 30), is a former fighter pilot, artist and one of the first Soviet cosmonauts (along with
Yuri Gagarin
). Leonov flew on two historic missions in the Russian space programme: the first spacewalk in 1965 and the first joint flight between the USSR and US in 1975.,It was a momentous day on 18 March 1965 when Leonov performed the world’s first spacewalk. However, Leonov struggled to fit back through the airlock as his spacesuit ballooned due to excess pressure during the walk. In the end, he opened a valve in the suit to let some of the high-pressure oxygen out, the suit deflated and Leonov squeezed through the airlock head first.,In that instance, Leonov’s brave decisions helped him escape unharmed, but the crew also had trouble with the spacecraft’s brakes upon descent. Leonov and the pilot of the craft, Nikolai Belyaev, made their final landing off course, in the depth of the Taiga forest.,Minutes earlier, the cosmonauts had orbited the Earth, becoming part of the new space age. Back on Earth, they had to fight to survive in a different kind of wilderness. After two nights in sub-zero conditions, the two cosmonauts made it out of the woods on skis, chaperoned by a rescue crew.,Leonov’s achievement was momentous – one of many historic milestones for the Russian space programme –  beating the US
Project Gemini
spacewalk by three months. But it was not the heated competition between the USSR and US space programmes that launched the next phase of space travel. Rather, it was their collaboration.,Beginning in the 1970s, an unprecedented partnership began between these two space superpowers. It was this spirit of cooperation that launched the first joint USSR and US flight: the 1975
Soyuz-Apollo mission
, with Alexei Leonov as the commander of the Russian crew.,The mission began with Russia’s Soyuz launch from the
Baikonur Cosmodrome
on July 15, 1975, followed by Apollo launch seven hours later from the
Kennedy Space Centre
. Differences in language, technology, and politics were set aside. The mission brought together the engineers from both nations, who collaboratively designed a petal-shaped universal docking system – the first of its kind.,The rendezvous of the two spacecraft, the Soyuz under command of Leonov and Apollo under command of Thomas Stafford went smoothly. The two crews – two cosmonauts and three astronauts – exchanged flags and gifts, participated in collaborative scientific research, and shared dinner together. They also explored each other’s crafts, describing the technologies to the eager audiences back home.,Leonov is not just a cosmonaut; he is also a talented artist who has reflected on his own exploration of space through numerous paintings and drawings, images of which will feature in the upcoming Cosmonauts exhibition. He has taken his coloured pencils on missions and drew portraits of his international crewmates as well as ‘landscapes’ of the Earth from above.,Also sharing a birthday with Leonov is another space pioneer. Helen Sharman, the first Briton in space and the first woman to travel to the
Mir space station
was born on 30 May 1963.,From the early days of the space programme, when every mission seemed to belong to the realm of science fiction, through Cold War rivalry to the era of the International Space Station, these stories are proof that once hostile nations are capable of cooperation towards a shared goal."

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/alfonso-cuaron-on-the-making-of-gravity/,Roger Highfield,Alfonso Cuarón on the making of Gravity,Oscar-winning director Alfonso Cuarón discussed his space thriller Gravity in a recent event at the Museum. ,"At the Museum,Exhibitions and Galleries","cosmonauts,physics,space,valentina tereshkova","Visitors to the Museum were treated to a special evening with Oscar-winning director
Alfonso Cuarón
last week as he discussed his space thriller
Gravity
with the journalist and broadcaster
Samira Ahmed
, Visiting Professor of Journalism at Kingston University.,Gravity received ten Oscar-nominations and
won seven
, including Best Director for Cuarón, who told the packed IMAX audience that he does not regard the movie as science fiction or fantasy.,Instead, the Bafta-winning director
prefers
to call it “a thrilling drama’ about the plight of Dr. Ryan Stone (
Sandra Bullock
) and her personal journey of redemption.,When it comes to the origins of the movie, Cuarón said that he had been much more influenced by the reality of space exploration than sci-fi. As a child, he had been gripped by
Marooned
, a 1969 American film directed by John Sturges and starring Gregory Peck, Richard Crenna, David Janssen, James Franciscus, and Gene Hackman about three astronauts who become stranded in space and subsequent rescue by the Soviets. ‘It was very well researched and they really took seriously the realistic approach…it is a blast.’,The relentless daisy-chain of action in Gravity was inspired by another script –
Desierto
– written by Cuarón’s son and fellow scriptwriter
Jonás
, which will be released as a film this year.,The first draft of their script only had one character, Dr. Stone. The father and son team wanted to make her journey during this chain reaction of challenges ‘work metaphorically’, focusing on the idea of her rebirth in the hostile environment of space.,Earlier that night I took Cuarón around the
Cosmonauts exhibition
and he pointed out how the astronauts sit in custom-moulded seats to adopt the fetal position within a descent module such as
a Soyuz
, which can be regarded like a womb, while spacewalkers were tethered by a glorified umbilical cord as they floated in the void.,But relying on a single lead character ‘proved to be a bit self-conscious’, contrived, even tedious, he admitted. That is when he and his son started to develop the role of a companion, the veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski, played by
George Clooney
.,The audience was held rapt by the four clips introduced by Samira Ahmed, starting with an accident with a Russian satellite that triggers the
Kessler syndrome
, named after Donald Kessler, formerly at Nasa’s Johnson Space Center in Houston. With a colleague, Kessler proposed that collisions between man-made objects in orbit could spawn swarms of junk, sparking a chain reaction that would swiftly ring the Earth with the debris from thousands of satellites. It is already ‘full of trash up there,’ said Cuarón.,Even though ‘the whole story is quite impossible (we’re not stupid)’ he told the audience, he said he still wanted it to feel authentic, based on circumstances faced in real space exploration. He spent time talking to Nasa. ‘I asked astronauts what can go wrong. They said: ‘everything’’.,Although some carped about details in the film, the Apollo 13 commander Jim Lovell told me that Gravity is “a marvellous creation of cinematography”. And Cuarón was careful to explain that sometimes, paradoxically, the real thing looked too unreal for Hollywood. In the case of
the spacesuits
, for example, they chose an older ‘last season’ design because the latest versions looked too ‘science fiction.’,Kowalski also gossiped much more than real-life astronauts to contrast with Bullock’s ‘shut up’ character. He added that he felt obliged to let George natter because ‘he’s so charming.’,In making the film, Cuarón had to overcome many technical challenges. Only at the last moment did he tell Bullock, who was not keen on flying, that she did not have to film in a so-called ‘vomit comet’ (a specially fitted plane that climbs and dips to simulate weightlessness, often with unfortunate effects). In this way, he hoped that she would be more receptive to endure the pain of being suspended on 12 wires like a glorified marionette to simulate microgravity. It was like something out of ’Fifty Shades of Grey’ he joked.,Bullock had to work out for four months and practiced with professional puppeteers, from the play War Horse, to be fit enough to film the fire sequence scene. ‘Took us forever to figure out how to do it,’ explained Cuarón, explaining that it took robots, a specially built rig and simulating the complex movements of belts and tethers. The end result shows her floating and twirling through the space station during the sequence, filmed in a single fluid shot.,Not all effects were high tech. For the final, lengthy re-entry sequence, Bullock was jolted and shaken around in a capsule that sat atop of pneumatic tyres as the film crew jumped up and down. In this way, the movie recreated her thundering passage through the atmosphere back to Earth, which Cuarón likened to riding a ‘rodeo bull’. To help build the emotional climax of Gravity, he added music, sans percussion.,He also admitted to Samira Ahmed that the movie cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki was ‘so upset with me’ when he edited out his favourite moment. On the cutting room floor lies a scene in which Kowalski and Stone see a Soyuz approaching them and think, wrongly, that it was a rescue mission. As they gazed at each other ‘helmet to helmet’ bathed in sunlight, they ‘lose it for a moment’. ‘It was a good scene, I love it,’ said Cuaron. But to maintain the emotional momentum, and prevent the movie from becoming repetitive, it had to go.,The stunning cinematography was brought to life with the help of British visual effects company Framestore, and was informed by discussions with scientists, for instance about how flames appear in space (spherical and ‘quite beautiful,’ he said) and earlier real-life incidents, notably on the Mir space station. Bullock would even ring up Nasa astronaut Catherine Coleman as she orbited in the International Space Station for advice and insights.,The studio attempted to persuade Cuarón to end Gravity with a dramatic helicopter rescue of Bullock’s character, or even with Dr. Stone rekindling love interest with an individual in mission control. He rejected the overblown and cheesy in favour of a simple shot of ‘a little house in the distance.’,The event was the latest in a series to celebrate
Cosmonauts
, the most significant exhibition of Soviet and Russian space artefacts ever staged outside Russia. Alfonso Cuarón told the IMAX audience the exhibition is ‘amazing…the Soviet space programme has been very, very underrated. It is so great that it is finally celebrated.’,As he left the auditorium, the audience watched a video of the cosmonaut who deserves to be the original inspiration for Dr Stone: the great
Valentina Tereshkova
. Tereshkova was the first woman in space, the first civilian and remains the only woman to have flown solo in space.,Roger Highfield is Director of External Affairs at the Science Museum."

Curator Doug Millard explains more. ,"Exhibitions and Galleries,Science in the news","alexei leonov,cosmonauts,space","Forty years ago today (17 July 1975) the Soviet Union and the United States shook hands in space during the
Apollo-Soyuz Test Project
– the first time the two space superpowers had collaborated on a space mission. The Soviet director of the project – Konstantin Bushuyev – reckoned the only significant difference of opinion between the two teams had been that his American opposite number – Glynn Lunney, “drinks black coffee and I drink mine with cream”.,Of course, there had been plenty of disagreements and arguments over the three years of intense planning and negotiation required for the mission. Each side had to learn about the other’s spacecraft; how Soyuz and Apollo worked, how they could be joined together in space and what new techniques and systems would need to be developed to do this. And there was the language problem; how to accommodate two teams that spoke different languages. In the early days it had not been easy:,American Translator: Good evening!
Soviet Party: Hello!
American Translator: This is the Manned Spacecraft Center speaking. May we speak to Professor Bushuyev?
Soviet Party: Hello!
American Translator: Hello, can you hear me?
Soviet Translator: I hear you well.
American Translator: Good! This is the MSC NASA USA, may we speak to Professor Bushuyev?
Soviet Party: Professor Bushuyev to the telephone? I will ask him.
American Translator: Oh! That is you.
Soviet Party: Yes.,The Apollo crew – Tom Stafford, Deke Slayton, and Vance Brand – were given intensive courses in Russian and
Alexei Leonov
and Valeri Kubasov, their Soyuz crew-mates, were each assigned a personal English tutor. Stafford, veteran commander of the
Apollo 10 mission
around the Moon, put his newly acquired command of Russian to good use one July 4 evening at the cosmonaut training facility near Moscow. He and his astronaut colleagues had been letting off fireworks and crackers that “sounded like a machine gun”. To a suspicious policeman that approached he said “Dobryy vecher. Kak dela? Eto den?’ Nashey revolyutsii!” (Good evening. How are you? It is the day of our revolution!).,Leonov and Stafford’s handshake
in orbit was transmitted around the world – the first time that Soviet citizens had seen live TV pictures of cosmonauts in space. Previous Soviet space missions had been reported mostly by radio and the newspapers – and then only once successfully underway or completed, or stitched together into films shown later at the cinema. While Soviet and American engineers and managers laboured over the technologies of joining two spacecraft in orbit the respective media teams had had to conduct long and protracted negotiations to ensure each side reported the mission to their own satisfaction.,Forty years on it may seem as though Apollo-Soyuz has become a footnote in space history, a one-off event that struggles against the dazzling space race of the 1960s. And yet, the mission demonstrated that two fundamentally different cultures could work together through a common language of space exploration. Twenty years later the
US Space Shuttle docked
for the first time with the Soviet’s Mir space station. And today the International Space Station continues to host astronauts and cosmonauts from around the world. The vital agreement between the Russian and US space agencies for its operation has now been extended to
run until 2024
, despite political differences between the two nations.,Alexei Leonov recently visited the Science Museum as part of the launching ceremony for
Cosmonauts: Birth of the Space Age
. This major exhibition, which opens on 18 September 2015, will reveal the most significant collection of Russian spacecraft and artefacts ever to be shown in the UK.
Leonov spoke proudly
of his involvement in the Apollo-Soyuz project, a diversion from the Cold War that demonstrated how opponents could still work together. But he still chuckled mischievously when recalling how ‘Every day we spoke on Good Morning America’ as the Soviet passed overhead small town America.,The blog was first published on

first Apollo moon landing
in July 1969. In the opening event of the Museum’s
Summer of Space
season, Lord Rees and Dr May discussed the past, present, and future of space travel with the museum’s Science Director, Roger Highfield.,,Lord Rees, Astronomer Royal, is the author of
On the Future: Prospects for Humanity
, which explores space along with themes such as robotics, AI and the threat of climate change and is ‘written from the viewpoint of a scientist, citizen and worried member of human species.’ However, he confessed to a packed IMAX auditorium that: ‘any predictions I make should not be taken too seriously.’,Astrophysicist and Queen guitarist and songwriter Dr Brian May has written
Mission Moon 3-D with David Eicher, published by The London Stereoscopic Company
, a 3D account of the events around Apollo, which demanded ‘months and months’ of work, sometimes when he was on tour with Queen.,Dr May discussed a range of subjects with Highfield, from the use of stereo images on space missions to May’s single New Horizons, released when the eponymous
NASA spacecraft
encountered Ultima Thule, the farthest-flung celestial body ever to be visited (‘What rhymes with Ultima Thule?’ Dr May asked.),He also played a role in ensuring the
archive of Patrick Moore
, the outreach astronomer (‘the greatest of all time’) and presenter who helped map the moon,
became part of the Science Museum Group collection
. It was Moore who had encouraged May to finish his doctorate after a 30-year break,
achieving his PhD from Imperial College London on the Motions of Interplanetary Dust in 2007
.,Together, they considered what would have happened if ‘these brave men’ Neil Armstrong and
Buzz Aldrin
had perished in their attempt to set down their
lunar module
(a model of which can be seen in our Exploring Space gallery) on the moon, an eventuality for which a
Presidential speech had been prepared
in advance: ‘
Fate has ordained that the men who went to the moon to explore in peace will stay on the moon to rest in peace.’,They pondered a revival of the ‘Apollo spirit’ and Lord Rees discussed the benefits of a moon base in the
Shackleton crater
at the lunar south pole, adding that he believes that the future of human exploration is more likely to lie with
privately-funded space-farers
.,Lord Rees also discussed the benefits to humanity of terraforming Mars versus curbing climate change here on Earth and speculated about a distant ‘post-human’ future of space exploration, when our descendants may well be electronic rather than flesh and blood.,The museum’s
Summer of Space
also includes its biggest ever sleepover:
the Apollo Astronights
; IMAX screenings of
Apollo 11: First Steps Edition
, which uses never before seen footage; a special preview of BBC Two’s new docu-drama
8 Days: To the Moon and Back
; a screening of Smithsonian’s
Apollo’s Moon Shot
film, with a live score by Teeth of the Sea, introduced by former NASA astronaut Wally Funk; and space-themed workshops and activities as part of the

They were grainy and blurred but there was no mistaking the face of Elena’s daughter on the screen: her name was Valentina Tereshkova. Her mother was shocked; she had known nothing of the secret work Valentina had been engaged in the previous year – training to be a cosmonaut. Now Valentina had become the first woman ever to leave the planet and fly into space.,Valentina had been inspired deeply by Gagarin’s mission and wondered whether she might too one day fly into space. She loved adventure and was an accomplished parachutist, and later that summer she sat down and wrote to the authorities asking to become a cosmonaut.  She waited and waited for a reply.,Meanwhile, the United States’ Mercury astronaut programme was underway: Alan Shepard became the first American in space just a few weeks after Gagarin, and Gus Grissom followed in July 1961. Tom Wolfe would later refer to the seven Mercury astronauts as possessing the ‘Right Stuff’ – that blend of talent and courage that set them aside from ordinary mortals. The Mercury 7’s image was one of overt maleness; it seemed unlikely any woman would fly into space any time soon. Indeed, a group of 13 women who wished to be considered by NASA were turned down by the agency as none had been through military air training schools, despite their being accomplished civilian pilots.,Back in the USSR, and well aware of the American interest in female astronauts, the head of the cosmonaut training programme Nikolai Kaminin was including women in the next batch of cosmonaut trainees: “We cannot allow that the first woman in space will be American.” Spotters were sent incognito to aviation clubs around the USSR seeking suitable candidates for the new but secret programme. Valentina was one of 400 women who were long-listed for further tests and by the beginning of April 1962 this list had been whittled down to just five.,Why was Valentina chosen finally ahead of her colleagues? Her parachuting counted for much – all early cosmonauts had to bail out of their spacecraft before landing back on Earth, and she responded well to the barrage of tests the candidates were subjected to.,It was her personality and background that counted greatly too. Her family had overcome loss and deprivation, her father was killed in the Soviet-Finnish war of 1940 and her mother raised three children on her own. She had character and she mixed well – throwing herself into team and group pursuits. She was a grafting textile worker, took a correspondence course in cotton weaving and became an active member of the Communist party’s local youth league.,Valentina Tereshkova was launched into space 16 June 1963. She spent almost three days orbiting Earth, spending more time in space than all of the Mercury 7 combined. It would be twenty years before the first American woman (Sally Ride) was launched into space.,Tereshkova certainly showed women too are made of the Right Stuff, or in Russian “то, что надо”.,﻿"

The Science Museum’s new exhibition, Driverless: Who is in Control? opens today and explores how these technologies could soon influence our lives.",At the Museum,"AI-tech,autonomous vehicles,Driverless cars,Driverless: Who is in Control,engineering,robotics,transport","In the first section of the exhibition dedicated to Air, you will get a chance to see various uses of autonomous drones. They have already been used in parts of Europe and Africa to deliver medical supplies, conduct scientific research, survey disaster sites and more.,Introducing drones to our emergency services could save lives by transporting materials like blood and AEDs more quickly, locating people inside burning buildings, and helping the police track suspects.,This all sounds amazing, doesn’t it? Outside of the lab, though, these technologies often misidentify people. They could also be used to collect sensitive data, such as our banking information, or take photos of someone without their knowledge. As drones become more common in cities, it is important to consider how we want them to be used.,Moving on to Land, the exhibition explores some of the challenges that we must tackle before we could see truly self-driving cars on our city streets.,The Citroen DS19
, the oldest object in the exhibition, is one of the first self-driving cars ever developed; it was modified by the Road Research Laboratory in 1960 to guide itself over a stretch of the M4 on an electric cable, and a report from that time suggested that all cars in Britain would be driverless by 2010.,Alas, we are still a long way from this becoming reality. While artificial intelligence can outperform humans at specialised tasks in predictable environments, we are better at reacting to unpredictable situations outside of the lab, like in city streets.,In the final section of the exhibition, Water, we feature technologies that are helping scientists researching and exploring some of the most remote parts of the planet.,Surprisingly, we know more about the surface of Mars than we do about our own oceans, but with the help of AI tech this could soon change. Autonomous submarines, like the
Auto Sub Long Range Boaty McBoatface
, could be able to explore up to 95% of the world’s oceans and collect data from places no human has ever been before. This will provide crucial information to scientists who are trying to predict what the impact of climate change will be on our planet.,,Ultimately, as autonomous technology increasingly develops and allows self-driving vehicles to become more and more independent, their presence in public spaces will also grow.,In
Driverless
, you will be able to discover the positive impact these machines could have on our society, as well as the risks associated with them so that you can have a say in how they should be used.,The exhibition is supported by Principal Sponsor: MathWorks, Major Sponsors: Direct Line Group and PwC and Technology Partner: Samsung Electronics UK."

However, this is a vast improvement from just
3% in 1989,
and the figure continues to grow.,,In recent years there has been an active call within the gaming industry to recruit more women. Gary Carr, Creative Director at Lionhead Studios explains, “I don’t want guys making games for guys. I want guys and girls making games for guys and girls.”,This logic stems from a 2014 study conducted by the Entertainment Software Association, who discovered that 48% of the gaming community was female and that this number was rapidly increasing. From this, they concluded that this upward trend in female gamers needed to be mirrored by those who were creating the games. But is this easier said than done?,We spoke to Jessica Baker and Victoria Hall from Rare Ltd, the games company that brought you Donkey Kong Country, Banjo-Kazooie among other great titles, to see what it was like for them getting into the gaming industry.,Jessica, a Gameplay Programmer, works on the gameplay engineering team and is currently writing code for a new game called Sea of Thieves.,She explained that her job is to “implement the features that players get to see.” Her most recent project was to write “the code that calculates cannonball trajectories so that skeleton enemies can fire cannons at players’ ships.” This involved making some precise calculations, and then ignoring them, because, as she explained, the  feature wouldn’t be much fun if the skeletons hit their target every time, so she “wrote code that makes their aim a bit wobbly.”,Sounds fun, right? So how did she land her dream job as a Gameplay Programmer?,“I graduated university with a Mechanical Engineering degree, but I wanted to get into the games industry because I wanted to use my skills to create entertainment. I spent time building up a portfolio of code projects, attending events, and talking to people already in the industry. Once I had a strong application and could demonstrate my potential to learn on the job, I successfully applied to my dream job at Rare.”,,Victoria, a Concept Artist, creates beautiful 3D art using programmes such as Adobe Photoshop and Autodesk Maya. Her path into the industry also started at university, but again it was her passion and dedication that got her where she is today.,“I decided to study Games Design at Sheffield Hallam University. Towards the end, I started to apply for concept artist jobs. Although I got a few interviews and art tests, I didn’t get anywhere. Despite having a stable job, my determination to become a concept artist never wavered. I put all my time and energy outside of work to furthering my portfolio until eventually, I got to work at Rare as a concept artist.”,Hard work, determination, and talent. These responses are so brilliantly genderless. It is encouraging that if you are passionate and willing to put in the hard work to build up a portfolio, you can succeed in making awesome games for awesome gamers, regardless of who you are.,,This post was inspired by

I’m one of three brothers with quite an eccentric Dad, and we used to make go-karts, peg-guns, dens, aerial runways, and all sorts of daft contraptions. My Mum also ran a business from home making Jack-in-the-Boxes, and then computer dust-covers, and my brothers and I were regularly part of the production line. When I look back we were always hacking things together, bodging up ideas and trying to create things which we thought would be fun. I ended up studying design at school, and it was the only lesson that didn’t feel like work, so I knew I wanted to design things for a living!,What is your favourite invention ever?,I think for its pure usefulness in everyday life, especially when I was younger, sellotape is my favourite invention ever.,What invention could you not live without?,I don’t think I could work or be inspired nearly as regularly or effectively without the internet. It’s a cliché to talk about how much it has transformed the world, but it really has opened up the exchange of ideas and information in a way that even 20 years ago, would have been unimaginable.,Which object in the museum is the most inspirational or influenced your time here so far?,I am constantly noticing new and fascinating inventions in the Museum. I was in the
Making of the Modern World gallery
and it occurred to me that it contains a collection of the most influential artefacts in human history – and they are the actual items.,The tool that Jenner used to do the first ever vaccination. A sample of the very patch of penicillin that led Fleming to develop antibiotics. The actual Rocket, the very first train. All of these changed the world.,The latest I have noticed is the first ever Davy Miners lamp. It’s a simple, elegant solution to a problem that was well identified and was causing hundreds of deaths a year. Humphry Davy figured out a safe way to make lamps that used naked flames, but did not ignite the flammable dust and gases often present in mines. Using a fine mesh he tested and refined his lamp until it proved a safe solution for miners to light their work underground.,Keep an eye on this blog and

The event was attended by members from local community groups, history societies, arts organisations and subject enthusiasts who had an interest in their Science, Technology, Engineering or Medical heritage.,The participants were firstly provided with the opportunity to attend two gallery tours of
Making the Modern World
and the
Science and Art of Medicine
, where they could explore some of the collections already on display in the Museum. Afterwards there was the opportunity to talk to staff and ask questions about the resources available to them and the ways in which they can be accessed. Please follow this

Not only do these include books and journals, but also original histories, biographies and digital sources.  The
Science Museum Library
is based inSouth Kensington, but there is also an Archive collection held at Wroughton.
Wroughton Library and Archive
contains original scientific, engineering and technology material from the last 500 years.,The day aroused great interest from the attending participants, and many were surprised with the wide variety of resources that are available in the Museum and Library and Archives beyond the display cases and exhibits.,For participants that were interested in funding opportunities for their research project, an external representative for the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) was invited to talk about the All Our Stories grant scheme.

Cataract
(the clouding of the lens of the eye) have been operated on for hundreds of years. One of the earliest operations was couching – pushing the clouded lens out of the way to restore some vision. By the 1740s, methods were developed to remove the lens completely.,However it wasn’t until the 1940s, that a successful artificial alternative to the eye’s lens was found, the intra-ocular lens. While working with injured pilots during the Second World War, Sir Harold Ridley and others found that Perspex slivers in embedded in the eye were not rejected by the body. This held the key to finding the right material for intra-ocular lenses.,Working with Rayners Limited, Ridley implanted an intra-ocular lens made from using a plastic known as PMMA (
polymethylmethacrylate
). On 29 November 1949 the first intra ocular lens was implanted into a patient in secret at St Thomas’ Hospital London. In 1951, Ridley announced his work to his peers to some scepticism before it became widely used.Today’s intra-ocular lenses have a variety of designs with over 1500 being registered.

The MAs were the lowest form of curatorial life, whose job it was to carry out day-to-day gallery maintenance, supervise the movement of objects, keep the location registers up to date, take phone messages and run errands for the curators of the collections. MAs also operated working exhibits and this is where the radio room came in.,It was located on the first floor and housed the museum’s famous amateur radio station,
callsign GB2SM
. My senior colleague Geoff Voller (G3JUL) was the principal operator but in 1968 his boss Keith Geddes, assistant keeper for Radio Communication, decided to install a top-of-the-range colour television receiver.,Thereafter colour television demonstrations alternated with the amateur radio operations. The radio and television equipment was located beyond a waist-high barrier fixed across the middle of the room to give a public viewing space.,In 1969 colour television was still a novelty in Britain.,Colour transmissions
started experimentally on BBC2
in July 1967 with the full-colour service beginning in December 1967. However, BBC1 and ITV did not follow until November 1969 and full national coverage took several years more.,It’s difficult to imagine now, but there was little daytime TV at that time.,To give television retailers something for customers to see during the day BBC2 broadcast
‘trade test transmissions’
. These were short colour films, mostly documentaries, which were constantly repeated.,My fellow MAs and I became very familiar with them as we needed to check the radio room set’s performance quite often, and a few films such as
‘The Home-Made Car’
(James Hill, 1963), became favourites with viewers.,However, on 16 July 1969,
BBC2 covered the Apollo 11 launch live
. It was scheduled for 13.32 UTC, or 2.32 pm BST, which was early afternoon and peak time for the Science Museum’s visitors.,The day was warm and as the time for blast-off grew near the radio room became very crowded. I wanted to see the broadcast too, but for me, this was no problem. As an MA, I was able to draw the barrier’s gate key, and rather self-consciously pick my way through the crowd, unlock the gate and pass through to the staff area beyond. I’d only been a member of staff for three months so this in itself gave me quite a thrill.,I sat down in one of the radio operator’s chairs and watched as history was made. The colour picture, relayed by satellite, was almost perfect, and I had a grandstand view.,,Fifty years on and I’m proud to still be associated with the Science Museum, and I cherish the memory of my younger self at the beginning of my museum career, experiencing something which would have been denied to me otherwise.,And now I wonder, back in 1969, could I ever have imagined that half a century later I would be writing up the experience as a ‘blog’? Me in 1969: ‘What’s a blog?’,Celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Apollo Moon landing at

George Daniels
made almost every part of this watch by hand in the early 1980s.,Named in honour of the
Moon landings
, Space Traveller II became, at the time of
its sale
in 2017, the most expensive British-made watch ever sold.,It has now been loaned by a private donor for display in the
Clockmakers’ Museum
at the Science Museum.,The Space Traveller II can be seen in an exhibit about George Daniels, the famous British watchmaker who helped revive independent watchmaking in the late twentieth century.,The watch is a new addition to the Clockmakers’ Museum, which displays the world’s oldest clock and watch collection, assembled by the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers, a City of London livery company, to which Daniels was closely associated.,Daniels made two similar watches (known as Space Traveller I and II). The first was sold soon after it was built, while the second watch was used by Daniels until his death in 2011.,The Space Traveller II is an 18ct gold-cased watch with a silver engine-turned dial. Fitted with Daniels’ independent double-wheel escapement, the watch can display both mean solar and sidereal (star) time.,The watch also shows the phase of the moon, an annular calendar, the equation of time and features an ingenious stopwatch which functions with either solar or sidereal time via the flick of a lever.,,A note on astronomical timekeeping
Our system of timekeeping is governed by the Sun, with a day marking the time taken for the Earth to make one rotation on its axis. However, when comparing the time on a watch with the time recorded by a sundial, the difference could be as much as 16 minutes at various times in the year.,This shortening or lengthening of the apparent solar day (the time measured by a sundial) is caused by two factors: Earth’s elliptical orbit and Earth’s axis not being perpendicular to the plane of its orbit.,Creating a mechanical timekeeper which can follow these changing daylengths is complicated, so they are averaged over a year to give mean solar time (the time measured by a watch). The difference between mean solar time and apparent solar time is known as the equation of time.,The Space Traveller II displays both mean solar and sidereal time, a timekeeping system based on Earth’s rate of rotation and used by astronomers to locate celestial objects. Sidereal time is 3 mins 56 seconds faster per day than mean solar time."

","At the Museum,Collections and Objects","medicine,wellcome collection,women in science","The medical achievements of
Dame Louisa Aldrich-Blake
(15 August 1865 – 28 December 1925), Britain’s first female surgeon, came under the spotlight in a 2015 display at the Science Museum.,If her name isn’t familiar then it certainly deserves to be. A century ago Dame Aldrich-Blake was busy writing to every woman on the medical register to enlist their help in setting up hospitals to treat soldiers injured on the eastern battlefields of the First World War.,Aldrich-Blake’s war work saw her, temporarily, leave the shores of Britain. In 1915 she crossed the Channel to work as surgeon for the Anglo-French Red Cross in the 600-bed field hospital at Abbaye du Royaumont near Paris. Conditions there were certainly very difficult. Louisa characteristically rose to the challenge, seeking out every trace of bullet fragments from the war-torn bodies of those under her knife. Such determination earned her the nickname of ‘Madame Générale’ from her patients.,The work of Louisa and her fellow female doctors serving overseas helped turn the tide of popular opinion back home in their favour. Their skill and dedication in treating soldiers, often close to the front line, was widely recognised and welcomed – helping to silence the War Office, which was initially reluctant to enlist the help of female medical staff. Furthermore, their example inspired other women to enter medical school for the first time.,By the time war broke out Louisa’s own medical career was already distinguished. She enrolled at the London School of Medicine for Women in 1887 aged 22, along with a handful of other new students. Her ambition was largely driven by a deeply held desire to do ‘something useful’. After completing her bachelor degree in medicine she quickly gained her Master of Surgery degree – the first British woman to do so. She also became Dean of the London School of Medicine for Women.,Aldrich-Blake also researched and pioneered new surgical methods to treat cervical and rectal cancers. In 1903 her paper on a new procedure to treat rectal cancer was published in the
British Medical Journal
. She was evidently extremely proud of this, because if you leaf through her notebooks – now held at the
Wellcome Library
in London – you will find a copy of the paper, carefully folded and pressed between the pages.,Aldrich-Blake’s contribution to medicine is celebrated in a statue erected in her honour in Tavistock Square in London – near the headquarters of the British Medical Association.,Dame Louisa Aldrich-Blake’s life and work was celebrated in a 2015 display at the Science Museum."

Wise wizards and magical incantations, pursuit of eternal life and the quest to transmute metals, turning lead into gold?,In that context the Science Museum seems an unlikely museum to send artefacts to join the British Library’s
Harry Potter: A History of Magic
exhibition.,The
British Library
exhibition explores magic and asks questions about why we believe the things we do. It reveals how many of the concepts in
J.K. Rowling’s work
are actually based on the history of science and magic.,And, if we think about the most fundamental ambition of scientists, to understand the natural world, it’s not far from the ambitions of ancient and medieval alchemists from Asia, Africa and Europe.,From ephemeral synthetic elements that survive for just seconds to the eternal steady motion of the heavenly bodies mankind has always desired to understand and manipulate nature.,The
Science Museum Group Collection
, together with the Wellcome Trust collection which we also care for, reflect this broad human ambition, holding items from the history of magic, religion and a hugely diverse range of cultures.,The creator of the philosopher’s stone,
Nicholas Flamel
was a French scribe active in the fourteenth century, later in the seventeenth century the legend of his discovery of the philosopher’s stone and eternal life emerged.,J.K Rowling contributes to this folklore, extending Flamel’s life to the early nineties when Flamel bravely sacrifices himself to help prevent Voldemort rising again in the first Harry Potter novel.,Visitors to the British Library’s exhibition will see a number of objects from the Science Museum Group Collection, including
Dragon’s blood
.,Folklore tells us that the blood of dragons had healing powers. The bright red resin still called ‘Dragon’s blood’ comes from a number of different plants, and this sample is from Daemonorops (Palmae), a type of plant most commonly found in Asia.,These materials are common in medical and alchemical processes, used for making medicines, dyes and incense.,Other drug jars in the exhibition contained Vitriol Coerul which chemists now call copper sulphate and
Ocul Cancr
which translates as crabs eyes, stones found in the stomach of cray-fish.,Another medicinal object in the exhibition is a
gold filigree case
containing a
bezoar
. Thrust down his throat by Harry, a bezoar stone saved Ron Weasley’s life in The Half Blood Prince.,A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons – Professor Snape,This stone is covered with a
highly ornate filigree case
, these kinds of stones, taken from the stomachs of animals, were quite common in the eighteenth century in Europe, they were so popular there was a healthy market for fake stones too. They are still used in parts of Asia today, thought to remove toxins from the body.,Harry Potter: A History of Magic also features
a miniature orrery from our collection
, made by celebrated instrument maker Edward Troughton, and more medieval and early modern medicines.,The final item from our collections is this
pharmacy sign
in the shape of a unicorn’s head. Mounted on an oak stand, the sign was probably made in England or the Netherlands.,Unicorn horns were believed to have medicinal qualities and were also a medieval symbol of purity and chastity. Apothecary would often display the long horn of a male narwhal whale, which was ground into a powder to be used in treatments."
https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/remembering-passchendaele-great-wars-double-vc/,Nigel Rothwell,Remembering Passchendaele and the Great War’s only double VC,The bravery of stretcher bearers at Passchendaele,"Collections and Objects,Exhibitions and Galleries","medicine,public history,war,wounded","A few years back, we celebrated the centenary of the Third Battle of Ypres (31 July – 10 November 1917). The battle was an attempt by Allied forces to break through German lines and cut access to North Sea U-boat bases, which were proving a threat to Atlantic shipping. The battle resulted in marginal territorial gain, and cost half a million casualties. It is remembered for the heavy rains which, following artillery bombardments that had destroyed the drainage ditches, turned the agricultural land into deep mud:
“I died in hell – (They called it Passchendaele)”
(Siegfried Sassoon, 1918).,In such conditions the stretcher bearers had a dreadful job. Quick to follow soldiers out of the trenches, carrying heavy wooden stretches, blankets and medical panniers, they were intended to operate as a team of six, but often only two or three was typical. They would continue back and forth across the battlefield under fire, applying first aid, making decisions on who to tend first, who to leave and who to carry back to the lines.,The conditions at Ypres made the job of the bearer teams that much worse – deep fetid mud, sometimes so bad that it drowned men, often littered with dead horses and body parts, and hiding discarded ordnance. It was here that the only double recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest military award for gallantry, in the Great War, Captain Noel Chavasse of the Royal Army Medical Corp, attached to the 10th Battalion King’s (Liverpool) Regiment, set up an advanced first-aid post in a captured German dugout.,Chavasse was awarded a Military Cross (MC) at the Second Battle of Ypres (1915) and a VC at the Battle of the Somme (1916). At Passchendaele he suffered a fractured skull,  was treated for this injury and returned to his post; he suffered two further head injuries, instructed stretcher bearers to take other wounded to safety whilst he remained with men who could not be moved. On 2 August he received a stomach wound requiring treatment at a casualty clearing station. He died of his injuries on 4 August 1917, aged 32.,His VC citation reads: “Though severely wounded early in the action whilst carrying a wounded soldier to the dressing station, he refused to leave his post, and for two days not only continued to perform his duties but went repeatedly under enemy fire to search for and attend to wounded who were lying out. During these searches, although practically without food, he assisted to carry a number of badly wounded men over difficult ground. By his extraordinary energy and inspiring example he was instrumental in rescuing many who would have otherwise undoubtedly succumbed under the bad weather conditions.”,The
Wounded
gallery, which closed in 2018, is a quiet area, away from the main museum, fitting for the reflective nature of the exhibition. Visitors may have a connection to the Great War, a professional or educational interest in medical developments, or are simply curious. Most leave humbled by a glimpse into the impact of the conflict on our armed forces and of the corresponding challenges faced by the medical establishment.,This post was written by Nigel Rothwell, who was one of our Wounded volunteers.

Call the Midwife
marked a moment in television history. It was the first time that a major drama programme looked at the issue of
thalidomide
.,In the late 1950s and early 1960s, thalidomide appeared to be a new wonder drug – a sedative seemingly without any toxic effects.,Thalidomide was available in Britain from 1958 to 1962 for a wide range of conditions, from colds and flu and as a sedative. Britain was just one of 46 countries where thalidomide was available. The drug was marketed as completely safe for pregnant women and for children and could be found in hundreds of products world-wide, under a number of different names.,However, the drug actually caused thousands of serious birth defects across the world, four hundred of those occurring in the United Kingdom.,The tragic link between the drug and its impacts on foetal development took years to uncover, in part because the effect was only felt when mothers-to-be took the drug during a very specific period of their pregnancy (20-37 days after conception).,As a result of thalidomide, changes were made to the way drugs were marketed, tested and approved both in Britain and across the world.,Long-time readers of this blog will know that
Call the Midwife
has always had a great resonance with the Science Museum’s medicine collections: from
foetal stethoscopes
to the appearance of our
mobile x-ray van
in an episode about tuberculosis screening.,Within the Museum’s collections, we hold a collection of prosthetics made for children affected by thalidomide (such as this
pair of artificial legs
) and
the drug itself
.,Many children affected by thalidomide rejected the use of prosthetics, as they were heavy, cumbersome, and in many cases, just not needed.,The powerful story of thalidomide will feature in the Science Museum’s
new medicine galleries
, due to open in 2019.,Visitors to the new galleries will see displays on
the drug itself
, its impact on families and the pharmaceutical industry and its continued use today, mostly under strictly controlled conditions.,Thalidomide may only have been freely available for a short period of time, but its legacy lives on through people who are living with its effects, and in the safety checks now in place when new medicines are developed."

not readily considered a disability
in the UK, despite it causing a range of issues for the three million people affected by the condition. Colour blindness (or colour vision deficiency) has proved an insurmountable obstacle for many of those wanting to progress in certain industries, such as aviation, rail, and maritime occupations. In April 2019, however,
Alex Bulley
became the first colour blind person permitted to drive a tube train, paving the way for others with the condition to pursue careers in transport.,Colour blindness has not always been considered a workplace hazard or a health and safety issue. When it was first theorised, by chemist John Dalton in the 1790s, the condition was viewed as a philosophical and scientific curiosity. The Science Museum holds a fascinating
booklet of coloured silk threads
used by Dalton to assess his own non-normative colour vision.,Railway Accidents,With the rise of the railways and commercial shipping, colour blindness became recognised as a potential threat to life. In 1855, George Wilson, an Edinburgh professor of technology, published
Researches on Colour Blindness: with a Supplement on the Danger Attending the Present System of Railway and Marine Coloured Signals
.,In 1875, physiologist Frithiof Holmgren linked a fatal railway crash in Sweden to a railway worker’s inability to distinguish between red and green signals. Propelled by his findings, Holmgren created his own method for testing colour vision; test subjects had to match up skeins of coloured wool.,With more and more train accidents being linked to colour blind drivers, throughout the latter half of the nineteenth century, fear permeated the railway workers’ network. This mass unease is reflected in the literature of the period.,Charles Dickens’ short story,
‘The Signal-Man’
(1866), was published just a year after the author was involved in the fatal
Staplehurst rail crash
. The story is about vision, visions, and deaths on train tracks. The eponymous signal-man regales the narrator with tales of apparitions. After each apparition, a tragic accident occurs; the final apparition turns out to be a premonition of the signal-man’s own death.,Whilst colour blindness is not mentioned directly, it is there implicitly. The apparitions are linked to anxiety caused by the red signal light: ‘that I did not like the red light […] I see no reason to conceal’. The narrator suggests that the apparition is produced by ‘a deception of [the signal-man’s] sense of sight’.,Shipping Disasters,Writing in
1895
, Thomas H. Bickerton, a Liverpool-based ophthalmologist whose personalia is held at
the Science Museum
, stated: ‘It is now no uncommon thing […] to hear of officers being dismissed for colour blindness who have held, in some cases for years, lucrative and responsible appointments on board ship’. Ship workers, like railway workers, were forced to leave their jobs – or were exploited through threats of disclosing their ‘defect’ – if they were found to be colour blind or visually abnormal.,Sailor turned author, Joseph Conrad, tackles this issue in his 1902 short story,
‘The End of the Tether’
. Captain Whalley, an aging skipper who hides his visual defects, is exploited by the ship’s owner, who – after discovering Whalley’s secret condition – purposefully misdirects him, in order to cause a crash and receive an insurance pay-out.,As in the Dickens story, colour blindness is not mentioned directly but is present just beneath the surface. When the ship’s First Mate finds out that Whalley’s eyesight is less than perfect, he experiences his own sympathetic symptoms: ‘the sun had turned blue’; ‘the very color of the sea seemed changed.’ These hallucinatory changes in hue mimic colour-blind vision.,Colour Blindness Testing Today,In the UK, today’s transport industries tend to use a mixture of the
Ishihara tests
, devised in 1917 by the Japanese ophthalmologist Shinobu Ishihara, and the newly-developed
Colour Assessment and Diagnosis (CAD) test
created by researchers at City University, London. The CAD test is more accurate and is focused on assessing the specific colour vision needs of particular professions, hopefully enabling a larger number of people to pursue the career of their dreams.,This blog is part of a series inspired by

By 1800, it was a global city and a world-leading centre of science.
Science City
tells the story of how science was integral to that transformation.,London was not a traditional learned-centre. Unlike Oxford and Cambridge or European cities including Paris and Leiden,
London did not have a university until the 1820s
. The science that happened in London was frequently driven by the commercial preoccupations of the city – which was not only the nation’s capital but also its busiest port, chief financial and trading centre, a hub of manufacture, the location of government and main residence of the monarch.,The introductory section of the gallery, ‘A New Trade’, explores how
Elizabeth I
recognised the economic potential of mathematics – for improving surveying, navigation, and architecture, and aiding trade and taxation.,At the time, the calculation and measurement devices used by practitioners in these fields generally had to be purchased from abroad, from craft centres including Flanders, Augsburg, and Nuremberg. The queen’s advisers encouraged artisans, based in Europe, with skills in engraving and instrument-making to come to London and pass on their skills to native makers.,By the early 1600s, this new trade was thriving. You will find instruments made by
Elias Allen
, a highly respected and successful maker who made devices for a wide range of customers on display in the gallery.
This compendium
, which combined a sundial, calendar and nocturnal for time-telling at night, was specifically made for a royal client.,We then move on to ‘Experiment and the City’. This part of the gallery covers the foundation of the
Royal Society
, a learned club formed in London to champion experiment as a way of finding out about the world. The Society’s fellows were aided in this project by the availability of new kinds of instruments, including microscopes, telescopes and air pumps, which enabled them to probe nature’s secrets in new ways.,The Royal Society’s Curator of Experiments,
Robert Hooke
, wowed the scientific world with his book
Micrographia
, in which he depicted the tiny worlds he had seen through his microscope. Central to Hooke’s success were his relationships with London’s artisans, with whom he collaborated to produce the lenses and other components for the instruments he used in his experiments.,‘Public Science in London’, the following section, reveals how science became a popular pastime in the 1700s. Audiences flocked to natural philosophy lectures, read scientific books, and purchased instruments for use at home. Particularly intriguing for London audiences were demonstrations of how science brought practical benefits. Models of a pile-driving machine used in the construction of Westminster Bridge during the 1740s were regularly used by lecturers to explain mechanical principles.,George III
was a passionate advocate for science, and upon becoming king commissioned a set of scientific demonstration apparatus for the education of himself and the wider royal family.
The ‘philosophical table
’, with its range of attachments, enabled a user to perform all the standard mechanical demonstration experiments.,The final section, ‘Science in a World City’, explores how ambitious projects, administered from London, were driven by intertwined scientific and imperial motives.,One such example is the first voyage of
James (later Captain) Cook
, to make precise observations from Tahiti of the
transit of Venus across the Sun in 1769
– before going on to search for the Southern Continent. His expedition was equipped with the finest scientific hardware of the time, made in the workshops of London’s instrument-makers.,This gallery draws on three iconic scientific collections: the
Science Museum Group Collection
; the
King George III collection owned by King’s College London
; and the collection of the
Royal Society
. Together they reveal how science was London’s lifeblood, but more than this, they emphasise that science was at the heart of our culture – and that is just as true today.,Science City is funded by

What can these five objects tell us about their place in medicine?",Collections and Objects,"materials,medicine","Across time and space, amulets were believed to possess the power to protect against illness or misfortune or to heal certain afflictions. These five objects, each relating to a bodily sense, show that just as their materials, designs, and functions could vary enormously, their use in medicine was also varied and broad-ranging.,First up, the (wonderfully creepy) eye miniature. This amuletic brooch, made in Italy between 1900 and 1914, may have been used to protect against the ‘Evil Eye’ – the widespread belief in the harmful force conveyed by a malevolent glance from an enemy.,Recorded by the Ancient Greeks and Romans, who were known to confront this injurious force with another ‘counter’ eye, the ‘Evil eye’ remains a renowned and feared power throughout parts of the Mediterranean. This brown eye, painted on shell, is mounted with a suspension loop indicating that it can be worn on the body for protection.,These fantastic little gold coins known as ‘Angels’ represent touch. In certain curative practices, it was believed that English and French monarchs had the power to heal through touch, and so many of these were given and used as touch-pieces. This procedure was performed by monarchs in the hope of curing ‘scrofula’, also ironically named ‘King’s Evil’.,Originating in the 11th century and continuing until the end of Queen Anne’s reign in 1714, one particular Angel from the image was issued by Henry VII (1485-1509). Whilst retrospective diagnosis remains a bit of a contentious issue amongst historians, if we were to do so with this disease, it would most likely be what we now know as tuberculosis. Angels such as these were often pierced so that they could be suspended and worn around the neck.,You may recognise the name of our next object, the bezoar stone, from Harry Potter. (Read Curator of Chemistry Sophie Waring’s
recent blog post
about Science Museum objects and their connection to the wizarding world.) But what does this stone have to do with taste? Well, this rather boring-looking yet edible stone was in fact used widely in early modern medicine, revered as an antidote to most poisons and an all-round panacea.,Bezoars are stony concretions that can be found in the stomachs and intestines of both animals and humans, made from indigestible materials including hair, vegetable and fruit tissues which form a hard, solid stone in the gut. Believed to be from a range of different animals including goats, hogs and monkeys, in the early modern era these stones were often ground up and added to drinks as tinctures. Delicious.,Decorated with fine filigree, a floral design and decorative blue beads, this ‘amuletic earring’ was made in Palestine between 1880-1930. Whilst we don’t know exactly what this object was used to protect against or heal, Palestinian objects made at the same time are made from similar materials.,Particularly recurrent are the blue beads, shown in
this object
to protect children against the evil eye. Indeed, blue beads of this kind have often been used to heal and protect the body across time and space. For example, one amuletic necklace from Croydon (1871-1916) was said to save the wearer from colds. Perhaps the blue beads in the Palestinian earrings were to protect against a disease of the ears, or even hearing loss?,Last but not least, this bizarre little object represents our final sense. This is a silver pomander, formed in the shape of a book, comprised of six compartments and engraved with a rat on the side. Pomanders were essentially glorified containers, capable of holding different substances such as herbs and spices. At the time in which this object was created (1601-1700) pomanders would have been used both as decorative items, and to protect the wearer against foul, potentially disease-causing air.,Different scents within the pomander could combat these foul and dangerous odours knows as ‘miasmas’. Whilst the important part rats played in the spread of the plague was not fully recognised before the end of the 19th century, they were associated with biblical pestilence and corrupt air, and thus the rodent on the side of this pomander may, therefore, hint at the objects’ specific function. [Pomanders more commonly assumed a spherical form, their segments opening like an orange.
This gilt pomander
opens out into eight segments, some of which are inscribed with the name of the contents, including ‘rosen’ and ‘moscat’]."

",Collections and Objects,"medicine,wellcome collection","Sometimes people’s daily experience is more interesting than the nuts and bolts of medicine. In the past, there was an array of choices in the

and many sought help from their family or from religion.,Many Christians have long believed that the saints are able to plead with God on their behalf and that particular saints can give protection against specific illnesses. Sometimes, a statue of a saint can tell you two things.; one – how the saint was martyred and two – what they are the patron saint of.,Take Saint Lucy:,Martyred in 304 CE for her beliefs, her eyes were removed before her death. To Christians today she is the patron saint of sight and eye diseases. But that’s not all – she is also invoked for dysentery, hemorrhages and throat diseases. Saints often

Curator of Technology and Engineering Elizabeth Bruton considers how this distinctive London landmark is an outcome of mathematical modelling.,On this day, 8 May, in 1984, the £535-million Thames Barrier was officially opened by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh. Construction of the impressive and unique flood control structure, which spans 520 metres across the river Thames at Woolwich Reach in East London, began a decade earlier in 1974.,The Thames Barrier is also one of London’s most striking and famous landmarks with its distinctive ten stainless steel piers first became operational in October 1982, 18 months before the official opening, and was first used in February 1983.,As explored in our exciting
Mathematics Gallery
, the architecture and design of the Thames Barrier was produced using elaborate mathematical modelling with this practical application of mathematics saving London from multiple tidal floods.,This 1:50 scale model on display in the Mathematics gallery (shown above) was given to the Science Museum around the time of the official opening in 1984 shows the innovative and futuristic design and internal structure and workings of one of one of the ten stainless steel piers with gates which can be raised into position across the Thames to protect from flooding and are also raised monthly for testing. These working scale models – although not shown working while on display – provide a unique insight into the workings of the Thames Barrier and the tidal flow of the Thames estuary. Previously, engineering scale models (of which we have many fine examples in the
Science Museum collections
) have been used to provide a model for testing and understanding engineering, technology, and the infrastructure around us and how and whether they would work.,When raised, the main gates stand as high as a five-storey building and as wide as the opening of Tower Bridge. Each main gate weighs 3,300 tonnes. The barrier and gates were designed to be bomb-proof and failure-proof and, in the event of the failure of the National Grid,
three backup generators
could keep the barrier in operation for a month.,The origins of the Thames Barrier lie in two severe flooding events which severely impacted London and the rest of Britain in the early- and mid-twentieth century. In 1928, the Thames Flood killed 14 people and caused thousands of people to be made homeless. In early 1953, the North Sea Flood caused by a heavy storm led to severe flooding in the Netherlands, Belgium, England and Scotland with over 300 people killed and an estimated £50 million of damage (approximately £5 billion in today’s money) in Britain alone.,This fatal and severe storm and flooding led to a complete rethink of London’s flood strategy and defences which had previously consisted of building higher and stronger river walls and embankments. By the mid-1960s, a report by Sir Herman Bondi put forward a new solution which would now be realisable in part due to the changing patterns in commercial and cargo shipping use of the river Thames and the docklands: a flood barrier with movable gates built across the Thames.,The concept of the rotating gates was devised by (Reginald) Charles Draper and in 1969 he built a working model. Five years later in 1974, construction of the barrier began.,Today, the Thames Barrier protects 48 square miles of the greater London area from the severe dangers of tidal flooding, storm surges and rainfall swelling. Over a million people; over £200 billion worth of property and infrastructure; a substantial proportion of the London tube network; and many historic buildings, offices, power supplies, hospitals and schools are protected by this futuristic structure spanning the river Thames.,Without the Thames Barrier, the Houses of Parliament, the O2 arena, Tower Bridge and areas of Southwark, Beckton, West Ham, Whitechapel would all be submerged in flood water. Alternative flood prevention measures would require the Embankment to be increased in height to top of the Victorian lamp-posts along this part of the river Thames, denying people a view of the river Thames.,The Thames Barrier is the second largest flood defence barrier in the world after the
Oosterscheldekering Barrier
in the Netherlands, with both flood control structures being responses to the 1953 North Sea Flood. The
Thames Barrier Information Centre
, consisting of an exhibition featuring 10-minute video and a working scale model, as well as riverside walkways, a children’s play area and the Thames Barrier Café, is open to the general public with more information available here."

.,Since its inception, photography has bridged the worlds of art and science with images which spark and sate curiosity in equal measure.,Through images of aesthetic beauty, we can tell stories about the universe and reveal places and phenomena that the naked eye will never see.,That is why we’re delighted to be hosting the Royal Photographic Society’s
Science Photographer of the Year exhibition
in the Museum and, having worked on a
long running science image competition
, it was a thrill to help judge the entries with Gary Evans of the RPS, UCL designer-maker-engineer
Zoe Laughlin
, TV presenter and space expert
Dallas Campbell
, and Catherine Draycott, Founder of the Wellcome Image Award.,We had to sift through hundreds of entries to the competition, which was open to all ages and levels of expertise, and, after much discussion, settled on a selection of 70 splendid images that will rekindle a link between the Science Museum and the medium of photography that goes back more than 160 years.,In 1854, a few decades after the first was taken by Joseph Niépce at Saint-Loup-de-Varennes, the Photographic Society organised its first public photography exhibition in Britain and later exhibitions were shown at the South Kensington Museum, which later became the Science Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum.,Even then there was an obvious link with science, as early pioneers of photography like Alan Archibald Campbell-Swinton and Eadweard Muybridge were driven by a desire to reveal the invisible processes and structures of our physical world.,In some of the entries, we found echoes of pioneering images that first expanded the field of vision during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, from the astronomically distant to microscopically small, such as Alfred Ehrhardt and Carl Strüwe’s photomicrographs that revealed the abstract beauty of microstructures.,Since the dawn of photography, the medium has benefitted from developments in chemistry to materials science. Today, the field has evolved once again. A traditional photograph is an image made from particles of light – photons – that scatter off an object and strike a photosensitive surface such as a film or a digital sensor.,Now we live in a post-photographic world; a world in which visualisations use new ways of “seeing” data and scientific phenomena, from the data streaming from satellites in low Earth orbit and staining techniques that show how a fertilized egg cleaves to a way to “feel” atoms – Atom Force Microscopy – and cryo-EM, a development of the electron microscope that can reveal the molecules of life.,Visitors to the exhibition will be taken on a scientific journey, from surprises lurking in the human body to glimpses of exotic microclimates and advanced instruments that can provide a new view of the heavens. In October, we will announce which images particularly captured the imagination of the judges from the 70 we selected.,Visit this exhibition to witness how science reveals new details of our extraordinary and many-faceted cosmos, from visual wonders to abstract images with an eerie beauty all of their own.,Turner once declared: ‘I paint what I see, not what I know to be there’. Today, science can deliver images that are sometimes more impactful and dominant than known realities.,The RPS Science Photographer of the Year exhibition will run from 7 October 2019 until 5 January 2020.

Wroughton
the other day, looking at some of the vehicles in our transport collection. One of them is a really lovely Renault taxi from 1910:,Ain’t it just a peach? Anyway, on the train back from Wroughton I was reading a 1930s book by Herbert Hodge, called
It’s Draughty In Front: the Autobiography of a London Taxidriver
. I was amazed to find that in 1915, aged fifteen, Hodge got a job in a taxi garage that ran Renaults just like the one I’d just seen.,In the book, he provides a terrific first-hand description of the cars and what they were like to run.,“When the drivers arrived I was expected to start their engines for them – a heart-bursting job in those days, especially with war-time petrol… I soon acquired the knack, learning to ‘dope’ the cylinders with petrol, and heat the plugs on the gas-ring, and all the other dodges necessary for those ancient engines.”,He went on:,“The most difficult knack to learn was the sharp pull to start the Renaults. The first time I got it, I gave such an almighty jerk, I brought the open bonnet down on my head. But I started the engine.”,I love finding these first-hand accounts of what new technology was
really
like, especially relating to stuff we’ve got in our collections. I feel genuinely closer to our Renault taxi having read Hodge’s words, and next time I visit Wroughton, I’ll be all over that car, imagining Hodge struggling to start the engine back in 1915.,Hodge was a very interesting character in other ways.

last week Air Commodore Stuart Evans RAF, Head of Joint Doctrine, Air and Space, DCDC, pointed out that ‘all nine sectors of the UK’s critical national infrastructure (communications, emergency services, government and public services, finance, energy, food, health, transport and water) all rely, to a greater or lesser degree, on space.,What to do about the debris problem, then? There is no simple answer at the moment and all the space players can do is ensure as little new debris is created as possible.,Prospero is still in orbit and next October scientists hope to re-contact it for its 40

Wells Cathedral
is seeing the oldest surviving clock face in the world, in the north transept. Above the face, jousting knights on horseback do battle, with one unfortunate being knocked over. Looking on, a figure called Jack Blandifer chimes bells each quarter-hour. Originally the knights charged every hour, but due to tourist demand the display was modified in the 1960s to allow a shorter joust to happen every 15 minutes. The knights switched from horsepower to electric power.
Here’s
a video.,Other parts of the clock remained hand-wound, carrying on a tradition of over 600 years. It’s a time-consuming job and the clock is
now going to be wound automatically
.,However, the original medieval clock from Wells Cathedral is still wound by hand. The mechanism, which was installed in the cathedral in 1392, was replaced in 1837. It came to the Patent Museum in 1871, and has been part of the Science Museum’s collections since 1884. Currently on display in our
Measuring Time
gallery, it’s the second-oldest working mechanical clock in England, after the one in
Salisbury Cathedral
(although that is not regularly run).,The daily job of winding the clock is done by Richard from our
Conservation team
. Each morning, he winds the clock’s three gear trains (one would have controlled the interior and exterior clock faces, one the hour actions and one the quarter-hour actions). The whole process can take up to half an hour and Richard says it’s a very good workout! Read an interview with him
here
.,The clock keeps very good time, only losing a few seconds per day. And our Conservation team keeps other clocks in the gallery running too – more about that in a future blog."

While there, I persuaded my family to spend time exploring the World War One battlefields around
Ypres
.  I was particularly interested in surviving evidence of frontline medical services.,This was once an Advanced Dressing Station (ADS), at a site known as Essex Farm. One of the largest surviving groups of military buildings in the area, these damp, claustrophobic structures were comparatively comfortable. Built in 1916, they replaced a more temporary station established the year before.,Close to the frontline trenches, it provided basic care for those wounded with each of the rooms having a designated function.  The largest were reserved for stretcher cases, those awaiting evacuation and for applying dressings and performing emergency operations.  Smaller rooms provided a kitchen, toilet and an area to treat the ‘walking wounded’.,The ADS was one of a
chain of facilities

evacuated

Blitz
on Britain was into its second week.,London remained the
main target

th
1940 were the world famous Lambeth Walk and the John Lewis department store on Oxford Street. While across the city, around 200 civilians were killed and 550 injured.,Such daily figures were typical in a month that left nearly 6,000 Londoners dead. But although the numbers were horrific, they were a fraction of those planned for in the pre-War period. Things were expected to be much, much worse.,In 1938, renowned British scientist
J.B.S. Haldane
predicted up to 100,000 deaths in an opening raid on the capital, while the Royal Air Force expected 20,000 casualties daily once German bombing begun. Plans were made to set aside 750,000 hospital beds and stockpile up to a million coffins.,The use of poisonous gas
was also anticipated. Civilian gas drills had become increasingly common as war loomed and by 1940 around 38 million masks had been issued to the population – from babies to centenarians.,As well as gas masks, our museum stores hold other reminders of this expected threat. For example, the small kit shown below was to familiarise
Air Raid Wardens
with the tell-tale odours of different gases.,As it was, the predicted civilian casualty figures for wartime Britain were
wildly inaccurate
. But then sustained, widespread aerial bombing of urban areas was – up until then – both an unknown quantity and a terrifying prospect. As post-war Prime Minister
Harold Macmillan
later remarked, “We thought of air warfare in 1938 rather as people think of nuclear warfare today”."

Matthew Boulton
experimented with thin copper, along the way managing to make one of his test balloons explode in mid air.,It wasn’t really their thing, and Watt wrote to another friend in October 1794,“Mr Boulton did idle a great deal of his time in playing with some small balloons some time ago but I hope he is now cured of the balloonomania” ."

nodules of flint

disease transference
are common to
folk medicine

Stones, animal teeth and a ‘tooth-like’ cluster of hazelnuts all employed by those suffering toothache.,Other objects in the collections have been transformed through physical, rather than spiritual, means. Here are a couple of my favourites.,The makeshift key on the left was secretly cut by a inmate at the
Brighton County Borough Asylum
after they had pilfered a standard canteen spoon like the one on the right. It’s not known how successful this escape attempt proved to be.,Unlike the ‘spoon-key’ some transformed objects do retain an echo of their former use. This tiny artificial limb was repurposed from a chair leg in 1903 by the father of a three-year-old boy who’d lost his right leg.,We don’t know the name of the wearer, but the dents and scratches on this object poignantly suggest that the mere loss of a leg didn’t slow this particular toddler down."

It was first introduced by Mr Andrew Oddy in the 1970s and materials are enclosed in a test tube with metal coupons and heated over 4 weeks. The principle is that the heating accelerates the aging of the material.,We use Oddy tests in museums to test how materials which are used for storage and display are going to react over time.,We can tell whether a material is suitable for use by looking at the metal coupons within the test tube. For example, if the material gives off gases while it ages the accelerated aging in the test tube will cause the metal coupons to corrode – obviously we don’t want this to happen to our objects!,You can also look at the condition of the materials after the 4 weeks and if cracking has begun to occur it may indicate that after 10 years your material will no longer be strong and stable.,Currently we are working alongside the British Museum to try and build up an archive of Oddy tested material. The aim is to then make the results of these tests available to other museums.,Sharing knowledge means that museums can ensure they are looking after their collections using the best possible materials.

Practices and treatments encountered from different cultures are selectively absorbed, and re-invented in parallel with traditional African practises to meet the specific health needs of African communities.,Jonathan adds, this fusion of medical cultures reflects to a great extent the power of African patients. Patients to an extent self-diagnose their problem in order to make choices about which medical system is most appropriate to them or which treatment they believe will be most effective.,Researchers like Jonathan are investigating how patients are making such choices – which has profound implications for improving health services.,Of course collecting these medicines poses some difficult issues for us Curators.

No wonder Mrs Watt banished his workshop activities to the top of the house.,Watt’s home at
Heathfield

We should spare a thought for Britons in January 1940 when, after the first Christmas of the Second World War, food
rationing
was introduced on January 8
th
.,Originally restricted to favourites such as bacon, butter and sugar, other products were
added to the list
as the war dragged on. Issued nationally in October 1939,
ration books
became an indispensable – if increasingly loathed – feature of
Home Front
life.,But for many of those queuing up that January for their weekly 4 ounces of bacon (or 12 ounces of sugar!) the experience was not totally new. The Christmas and New Year period of 1917-1918 had also seen the introduction of
targeted food rationing
. In both wars, attacks on merchant shipping by German
U-Boats
played a key part in creating food shortages. But while in the earlier conflict Britain avoided compulsory rationing until the final year, in the Second World War it came in very early.,Citizens had already been encouraged to improve food productivity through the
Dig for Victory!
campaign. They would also be tempted with new foodstuffs – such as
whale meat
. But there were limits to this self-sufficiency. As such, food formed a significant part of the
Lend-Lease
arrangements made with the U.S and Canada from 1941.,Despite the privations of rationing, it’s generally accepted that the nation’s
health improved
under it – particularly amongst the poorest sections of society.,Still, few mourned its passing – when eventually it came. Rationing was actually stricter in post-war Britain. For a time even bread and potatoes were controlled, neither of which had been rationed in wartime. Food ration books could only finally be torn up with the end of meat rationing in
July 1954

The King’s Speech
with Colin Firth, it inspired me to look into the two brothers of the film,
Edward VIII
and
George VI
using the Science Museum’s collections as my pool of reference. I was pleasantly surprised with the things I found.,Following a visit to an orthopaedic hospital in Stoke-on-Trent, the then future Edward VIII, had his hand x-rayed. It was a way of showing off a technology that by the 1930s was in every hospital in Britain. It was also a souvenir of his visit to the hospital maybe, to open a new wing or ward.,Taking X-rays of royalty for fun rather than medical purposes is one thing but can you imagine the pressure of operating on the reigning monarch? That’s precisely what Clement Price-Thomas from the Westminster Hospital was called to do for George VI on 23 September 1951 at Buckingham Palace.,The table was loaned to the Palace for the operation and afterwards went back into general use, with patients having no idea who they had shared an operating table with.,Edward VIII was also a donor to the Science Museum’s collections, donating a number of royal carriages in 1936.,This example was used by Queen Victoria in her advanced years. Unlike normal bath chairs, this example was pulled by a pony, led by a footman. If you want to see this chair in the flesh, it is currently on display at the
National Trust Carriage Collection in Arlington Court.,Snippets of the two brothers’ lives can be seen on Science and Society Prints including their

Nobel Prizes
were awarded 110 years ago. They were named after
Alfred Nobel
who made a provision in his will for annual prizes for Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, Literature and Peace. Prize winners are announced every June and awarded in December.,,Unsurprisingly, a large number of Nobel Prize winners are represented in the Science Museum’s collections and over the course of the year we’ll highlight a few of them in this blog.,The first prize winner in the Physiology and Medicine category was
Emil Adolf von Behring
(1854-1917).,Behring won his Nobel Prize for his discovery that blood or serum from another animal immune to a disease such as tetanus could be used to treat other animals (including humans) with the disease. The blood of an infected animal produces antitoxins that could by used to treat others effectively.,Behring’s breakthrough meant an antitoxin could be developed for tetanus and diphtheria in 1890. You might notice the date of the serum packaging. During the First World War, soldiers would be immunised against a raft of diseases they might encounter in crowded conditions.,Diphtheria causes a membrane to grow over tissues in the mouth and in severe cases into the lungs. After 1850, diphtheria was the principle cause of death of young children in the US and Europe.,Before Behring’s antitoxin intubation techniques were used aid breathing such as this set developed in 1882 by American physician, Joseph O’Dwyer but could not cure the disease.,Today, widespread vaccination programmes have controlled the spread of the disease.

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/the-world-of-spoons/,Stewart Emmens,The World Of… Spoons!,,Collections and Objects,"chemistry,medicine","Back in January, I posted about some unusual variations of one of our favourite pieces of cutlery –
the fork
. I guess it was inevitable that I’d be tempted to move on, delving further into obscure corners of our collections.,While trying to avoid
‘me and my spoon’
type territory, let’s take a random peek into… the world of spoons.,Made of soapstone, this small spoon is in the form of a diving girl sporting either a typical Ancient Egyptian braided hairstyle or a short headdress. It could date from as early as 1575 BCE. Described as an ointment spoon, it was possibly used for scooping up and measuring out drugs or cosmetics.,Precious materials were also carried by these spoons. Made of bronze, they were used alongside an ancient set of measuring scales, dating from as early as the 1400s. They were carried by local
Ashanti
gold traders, in Ghana – formerly known by its appropriate colonial name, The Gold Coast.,My third example is a
pair of silver spoons
, notable for their inscriptions rather than their appearance. Made in London in 1740, they were engraved the following year to commemorate two individuals, perhaps siblings, known only by their initials ‘G M’ and ‘I M’ who had survived
smallpox
. They were presented by the similarly cryptic ‘E P’.,Smallpox was a deadly disease. Pre-dating
Edward Jenner’s
vaccine by several decades, these grateful survivors were most likely left with numerous – and permanent – reminders of their near miss.,Fortunately, another once widespread disease
polio
, looks like it will soon join smallpox in
being eradicated
through human intervention. This leads to my final spoon, which is a bit of a cheat.  Today, children are likely to have their
polio vaccine
squeezed directly into their mouths from a plastic vial or via an injection. But, I remember a far more pleasant experience. One day at school, they gave us all a sugar cube.,Because as
Mary Poppins continues to tell us
, “a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down… in a most delightful way”."
https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/objects-with-a-story-to-tell/,Stewart Emmens,Objects With A Story To Tell?,,Collections and Objects,medicine,"I’ve previously posted of how our feelings about objects can be influenced by
associated stories
or by knowing
who once owned them
. Such links can provoke powerful responses, but perhaps none stronger than when objects have personal links to us. This is why family heirlooms are so treasured – they allow you to make a connection, to hold the same thing that a long dead ancestor once held.,At the Science Museum we like to consider that, potentially, every object can tell an ancestor’s story. And of course, our collections are littered with objects associated with named and identified individuals. But others offer tantalising clues that, with further research, could reveal some intriguing stories.,One of many such is the small, well-worn gold ring picture shown above – which featured in one of the
Christmas posts
. This was made to mourn the passing of one Augusta Bruce. Somebody thought enough of her to wear this
memento mori
. But as yet, we don’t know who Augusta was or even when she died. Her story is one yet to be revealed.,Similarly, this surgical instrument set carries the following inscription on it’s wooden lid:
The dates place it in Napoleonic times, but the set hardly looks battle-scarred. Was it presented to Ward for his services in the
Peninsular War
? Hopefully, in time we can reveal its story – but then we have many thousands of objects with stories to reveal.,One final object. A medal awarded by
The Royal Humane Society
to a Dr Houlston who “restored” a Mr W Young on 22
nd
August 1781. Such medals were often given to individuals who saved lives, especially when reviving those who had apparently drowned.,Houlston strongly advocated a
tobacco enema
in such situations, so chances are he employed its
supposed restorative powers
on this occasion. Perhaps smoking really can be good for your health sometimes. A bracing little chapter in Mr Young’s hopefully long life? Though perhaps not one he regaled his grandchildren with."

Whether, for example, in our experiment or not one will find anything different from Einstein, I’ve no wish to make any prediction about. Our job is to do the experiment. But physics advances, science advances, by measuring things’.,The results are a huge vindication for the Gravity Probe B project – it was in the planning for over 40 years and the mission faced cancellation several times. But, as Everitt says, we still may not have the final answer.,General relativity is so complex that there are many other predictions of the theory which are yet to be confirmed, and other scientists are busy making their own measurements.

set to return
to its… er… spiritual homeland, France. Distinctively green and extremely powerful, sales of

artistic circles
of Paris of the late 19
th
and early 20
th
centuries. Not that it was a peculiarly French habit. With its main ingredients of fennel, anise and the herb
wormwood
, it was imbibed across much of Europe and the United States. Initially considered a drink of the aristocracy, ‘absinthe fever’ rapidly spread to all social classes during the second half of the 19
th
century.,Nicknamed ‘the green fairy’, ‘the atrocious sorceress’ and ‘our lady of forgetting’, absinthe developed a fearsome reputation for mental and physical ruination. As such, it eventually became a public health cause celebre, its particular demonisation fuelled by virulent campaigning by
temperance groups
. They saw it as a easy target, whose abolition might be a first step towards the wider banning of alcoholic products.,While its negative social effects and alleged hallucinogenic properties may have been
overstated
by those opposing its availability, it is a very strong drink. Alcohol levels are over 80% in some brands – twice the strength of whisky.,And, at the height of its popularity, inferior versions started to appear which found a market among the more desperate drinkers. Just as
gin became culturally linked
with degradation and death in 18
th
century London, so absinthe did in the eyes of many Parisians by the end of the next.,In France, the First World War proved to be a final tipping point in the campaign against the ‘green peril’. Portrayed as a threat to national efficiency at a time many thousands of Frenchmen were fighting on the Western Front, it was prohibited during 1915. Similar bans were applied in other countries around the same time.,The ban was effectively lifted by EU regulations in 1988, but in France it could only be sold if it was not actually labelled with the name absinthe!

Professor Stanley Feldman

Other members of the team assisting them were present-day clinicians getting the chance of a lifetime to work with surgical legends like Harold and Stanley.,How has surgery changed? Well in the 1980s a surgical team (surgeon, anaesthetist and theatre sister) might have worked closely together for 20 years or more. Nowadays the team doing an operation may never have met until the day of the procedure, which can sometimes make communication a problem. Surgery itself is very different too. Then, all operations were done by ‘open’ surgery, often needing large incisions. Now, many operations use ‘
keyhole’ surgery
, where miniature cameras and instruments can be passed into the patient’s body through tiny holes in the skin.,The project has been led by
Roger Kneebone

#Player11.,One autumn in the late 1960’s the finest model ship builders were summoned to the Science Museum and put to work with tiny chisels and miniature rivets. They were to create an exhibition of exquisite models to echo Britain’s naval prowess and glory, and long did they toil. But not quite as long as the exhibition has been on display.,Before the current multi-mediated, intimately interactive and well thought-out exhibitions, there was the display case. The window to the past, the incubator of time, the proud bearer of artifact. We’d push our faces against the glass, turning the object round in the mind, imagining all it’s potential uses, all the possible and impossible situations it had survived, unable to tell whether our ideas were real or no.,I was floundering in this nostalgia last week in the Shipping Gallery, the location for
Battleships: Ocean Apocalypse
, a live, fully dimensional version of the classic vector thriller. Next year the thousand or so models, mini-engines and bits of navigation kit will be removed to make way for a new gallery, so we’re taking this opportunity to inject a last bit of life into the hulks and the paddles and the turbines.,This is the non-deleterious war the brittle liners have been dreaming of! Where ancient Northumbrian fishers can fight alongside Britain’s first nuclear submarine! Two teams will assemble a fleet from their favourite models and battle it out across the vast floor of the gallery. Miss! Miss!

industrial revolution
in all its terrible glory.,Here are the ‘Bedlam furnaces’ in action – open coke hearths used for smelting iron, the visible face of a burgeoning
coal industry
. But if we dig a little deeper, we find a rich and little-known iconographic seam in the Science Museum’s art collection.,For one thing, what de Loutherbourg saw at Coalbrookdale was not all fire and brimstone:,In this engraving, done only a few years after ‘Coalbrookdale’, everything is reversed: night has become day, the horse returns, and the sublime power of the iron works has transformed into picturesque calm. This is in line with much 19th-century industrial art; in the 1840s, for example, W. Wheldon produced the following two oil-paintings of collieries:,,Although he shows us the pollution at one colliery and the rough incursion into the landscape of the other, Wheldon’s pit-heads and coke ovens are undoubtedly clean and well organised, the elegant buildings perhaps even preferable to unruly Nature.,Attractive as these images are they don’t really tell us what life was like in the heart of the colliery, deep underground in the mines themselves. Such frank portrayals of the lives of miners are rare – it’s not easy to get access to a mine, much less to
publicise
its cruel machinations.,But amongst the Science Museum’s pictorial collections there is one such piece of documentary evidence: a remarkable set of amateur paintings, dating from the 1920s and ’30s, done by a miner called
Gilbert Daykin
. After each day at the pit Daykin would return home to paint from memory in his kitchen studio. Here is his 1934 ‘Thirst – The End of a Shift’, in which the deputy looks on dispassionately as one of his charges drinks from his 3-pint ‘Dudley’ flask:,In all of his works Daykin shows the stoic miners, neither pitying nor lionizing them. Yet he was subtly polemical. Another 1934 painting is entitled ‘The Tub: At the end of the coalface’, and shows two men working in cramped conditions:,The startling light and looming shadows create an impressive scene, an apt counterpart to de Loutherbourg’s grandiose ‘Coalbrookdale by Night’. But look closely and you’ll see that all is not well: the main crossbeam is cracking. The miner, his head touching the ceiling, is at risk of being crushed.,As Daykin said when interviewed for his exhibition: “I live in eternal dread of some injury to my eyes and hands. I am a specialist in dangerous jobs.” In 1939 Daykin was killed when the mineshaft he was working in collapsed."

His first post is below.,Being the writer-in-residence at a major London museum can be pretty demanding. There are people to meet, notes to be made, etc. – and all the thinking on top of that. When the stress threatens to overwhelm me I tend to head for ‘Agriculture’ on the First Floor. In one display case a series of tractors slowly turn in their own small circle, constantly tilling the same grey soil. It’s my equivalent of a Japanese raked gravel garden. After a couple of minutes, a sort of English pastoral Zen settles upon me and I’m right as rain.,To be honest, when I began the residency I was hoping for a hat of some description, with my title printed on it. And maybe a special phone on which I could be notified of potentially-interesting events: ‘There’s something weird going on in Marine Engineering. Grab your notebook and get yourself down there.’ As I approached the crowd I would say, ‘Let me through, please, I’m the writer-in-residence. This scenario may have potential as a short story, or a quirky piece for Radio Four.’,Instead, I am left to wander round the galleries in hatless anonymity. There’s the odd perk, of course. As a member of staff I get 20% discount on my lattes. And curators, who possibly have better things to be getting on with, seem quite prepared to sit down with me and discuss their specialist field. This morning I have been contemplating sidereal time and horary quadrants. Anything to do with Time or Cosmology, I find, can easily bring on a bout of brain-ache. But the moment I feel the pressure building I head back to the tractors – the slowly-turning tractors – and within five minutes my equilibrium is restored.,Mick Jackson

",At the Museum,"engineering,Soyuz TMA-19M,space,tim peake","The special event, hosted by the Science Museum in association with the
Royal Academy of Engineering
and the
Raspberry Pi Foundation
, saw Tim Peake presented with the Academy’s prestigious
Rooke Award for Public Promotion of Engineering
for his inspirational engineering and science engagement through the Principia mission’s education programme, the largest and most successful educational campaign ever organised to support a European astronaut mission.,The event opened with a preview of the Academy’s latest
This is Engineering film
showcasing the diversity of engineering careers, everything from fragrance sourcing to robotic farming, leaving the pupils keen to hear more. Next came a short video about Tim Peake’s journey into space, and the excitement was palpable as he arrived on stage.,Tim spoke at length about the gruelling training an astronaut needs to go through, and also the engineering that enabled his flight. Of course, there was the Russian Soyuz TMA-19M rocket that took him into space, but before he could fly, he had many hours of training on a simulator designed to present astronauts with all the scenarios that might occur in space.,The simulator, an impressive piece of engineering in its own right, could only take Tim so far. He could learn how to fly a spacecraft from the simulator, but it could not replicate what it would feel like inside the spacecraft. For that, he said, astronauts rely on what he called the “best fairground ride you could go on” the centrifuge, which spins so fast that training astronauts feel eight times their body weight in G-Force, preparing them for the sensation of a real launch.,Preparing for take-off is one thing. Preparing for life without gravity and going on six-hour-long spacewalks is quite another, and again engineering is vital. Spacewalking is a highlight for astronauts but working outside the spacecraft in orbit and in zero gravity presents many risks – most obviously falling off and floating out into space! They are equipped with jet packs, which they learn to control using virtual reality training systems.,Preparing the body for weightlessness also involves engineering – using a specially adapted aircraft, known as the ‘vomit comet’ that flies at high altitude and nose dives repeatedly, creating brief periods of near-weightlessness for training astronauts and conducting research.,The pupils’ most enthusiastic reaction to the high-tech engineering involved in space travel, however, was reserved for the toilet. Tim said that one of the most frequent questions he is asked is how astronauts use the bathroom. Yet what they might not realise is that the space loo is itself a great feat of engineering. For long trips to the Moon, or even to Mars, astronauts will need to be self-sufficient, recycling all their oxygen, all their water and growing their own food. The toilet on board the space station is already doing this – recycling 85% of astronauts’ urine into drinking water.,After Tim’s talk, three lucky school groups were invited to attend a special space-themed
CoderDojo
session in the
Flight Gallery
, where they were given an introduction to programming in a session led by the
Raspberry Pi
Foundation, a charity with a mission to put the power of technology in the hands of young people all over the world.,Before starting their challenge, the children were told how Raspberry Pi formed an integral part of Tim Peake’s space mission as two Raspberry Pi computers travelled to the International Space Station (ISS) with him on their own mission. These tiny computers, called Astro Pis, were used to measure the environment onboard the ISS, and give schoolchildren the chance to have their code run in space. To that end, the students were given their own Astro Pis and challenged to code them to send messages to the Astro Pi onboard the ISS to instruct it to check the current temperature in space.,Tim is passionate about inspiring young people with his experience of space and engineering. As the first British ESA astronaut to visit the ISS, he was keen to use the opportunity to inspire young people back in the UK. Onboard the ISS, through an educational outreach programme (
Principia
) of more than 30 projects, the mission inspired and engaged more than two million school children across approximately 10,000 schools – equivalent to around 15% of all school children and one in three schools in the UK.,It was for this incredible achievement that the Royal Academy of Engineering Chief Executive Dr Hayaatun Sillem presented Tim with the Rooke Award for “literally going above and beyond” in his mission to promote engineering and space to the next generation.,"

Sir Tim Gowers
of the University of Cambridge joked that being a mathematician is ‘not just being a bad pocket calculator – there is actually rather more to it than that.’,,In 1998, Sir Tim won a
Fields Medal
, one of the greatest honours in the field, for teasing out deep connections between two mathematical disciplines – functional analysis and combinatorics.,The medal ‘has made a massive difference to my life in a way that it shouldn’t have if the world were really a just place.’,In conversation with Science Museum Group Trustee
Dr. Hannah Fry
of UCL, author of Hello World and
Christmas lecturer
for 2019, it became clear that Sir Tim adopts a mathematical approach to his everyday life.,He has had a problem with abnormal heart rhythm and used his expertise to weigh up the risks of a heart operation, in which cardiac tissue responsible for atrial fibrillation is burnt out.,‘Do I really want to have this one in a thousand risk of dying?’ he asked himself. Further research led him to ponder the mortality risk for two months at the age of 50.,He found that, in effect, a month’s risk would be concentrated into the operation, so he decided to go ahead. The operation worked.,He has also pondered
the politics of Brexit and tactical voting, adopting a game theoretic approach, and puzzled over a deep postprandial issue, namely the most efficient way to tidy away dishes from the table to sink to the cupboard, in what must be the ‘travelling washer-up problem.’,‘I promise I have a life beyond that,’ he added, though he admitted he did not often tell his family about his quest to make everyday life more efficient with the aid of mathematics. When he has suggested more ergonomic approaches, ‘I have been slapped down very quickly.’,Sir Tim used ‘the largest slide I have ever had the pleasure of presenting’ on the IMAX screen to begin his lecture on how it is possible to go from mathematical patterns to general definitions, concepts and statements.,He went on to demonstrate how it is possible to generate new insights and questions by cross-fertilising generalisations that are ‘orthogonal’ (utterly different) from each other.,By this approach, one can chart a path to ‘the frontiers of mathematics’ – where he is currently venturing forth with one of his students – and where ‘we will never run out of interesting mathematical questions.’,Sir Tim believes that computers will play an increasingly important role in pure mathematics. Their use in automatic theorem proving, for instance, to verify proofs in number theory, or to cross-reference your work with other findings, ‘really interests me.’,He holds the ‘minority view’ that computers will eventually take over from human mathematicians, even if they are able to intuitively understand answers (
Ramanujan
is a famous example).,He believes humans will still play an important role for the foreseeable future though, at some point, there will be a ‘Golden Age of Mathematics,’ where computers prove to be extremely useful, ‘but don’t quite yet spoil all the fun.’,But the golden age might be short lived, he added.,His evening public lecture was the third held in the museum after earlier events with

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/batteries-included/,Margaret Campbell,Batteries included,Assistant Curator Margaret Campbell recounts Nobel Prize winner Akira Yoshino's predication that lithium-ion batteries ‘will play a central role’ in achieving a sustainable society. ,"Research,Science in the news",,"The Japanese chemist, Akira Yoshino, has delivered his Nobel lecture in Stockholm with a predication that lithium-ion batteries ‘will play a central role’ in achieving a sustainable society in which the environment, economy and convenience are balanced in harmony.,The Science Museum marked this Nobel moment by putting a lithium-ion cell on display – celebrating an everyday technology that changed the world.,Yoshino was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in October along with Stanley Whittingham and John Goodenough. The work of these three chemical engineers on lithium-ion batteries sparked a technological revolution – and now most of us use lithium-ion batteries in our daily lives. They power the devices we have come to rely on to communicate with one another, find our way around and entertain us.  Lithium-ion batteries are used in technologies as varied as hearing aids, mobile phones, insulin pumps and electric cars.,Today, we take for granted that we can recharge this technology again and again. But before the innovations made by Akira Yoshino, John Goodenough and Stanley Whittingham, it wasn’t possible to safely recharge batteries. This meant that once they ran out of power, they had to be thrown away.,The lithium-ion battery changed this. In the 1970s and 80s, innovations in chemical engineering made them safe and efficient to recharge. They were introduced to the commercial market in 1991, opening a new world of possibilities for inventors. This began a technological- and social – revolution in the 1990s, enabling the widespread use of portable devices like mobile phones, laptop computers and MP3 players. They also made existing medical technologies, like pacemakers and insulin pumps, more reliable.,Batteries could soon play an even more significant role in our lives and help us ensure a more sustainable future.,It has become critical that we reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. Getting more of our energy from cleaner sources, like solar panels and wind turbines, will be an important part of this. But many sources of renewable energy, like wind and solar, are unpredictable, providing varying amounts through the day and year, so supply doesn’t always match demand. Unlike coal-fired power plants, they can’t be turned off and on as our energy needs shift. Being able to store large amounts of renewable energy would ensure we always had enough available. Lithium-ion batteries are one of the technologies being explored to do this.,,Yoshino believes that lithium-ion will remain the dominant battery form for at least another decade. But chemical engineers are also investigating other materials that could someday allow batteries to store large amounts of energy safely. There is already a huge range of battery types for different uses, and in the future, this will likely expand even further to suit the needs of various technologies.,Of course, batteries alone cannot solve our energy problems. We need to make our homes more efficient so we can reduce our consumption and adapt how we eat, travel and shop if we are going to limit our impact on the environment. But batteries could provide one of the solutions we need to make our future more sustainable.,You can now see a lithium-ion cell on display in the

Royal Society
was founded on this day in the year 1660, and as
London’s first society dedicated to scientific enquiry,
it is still thriving 359 years later.,The Society has called many places home, the first of which was an even older institution that also endures to this day:
Gresham College
. The College first stood on Bishopsgate in the City of London, on the site now occupied by
Tower 42 (formerly the NatWest Tower).
The original building may be long gone, but it is immortalised in a fantastically detailed bird’s-eye view engraved by
George Vertue
.,From Vertue’s image, we can work out where the Society’s members typically met. The top right-hand corner of the courtyard shows lodgings once occupied by
Robert Hooke
, Geometry Professor at Gresham College and the Royal Society’s first Curator of Experiments.,Here, experiments would be performed and recorded in front of members who would then debate the results. Hooke even built an observatory on the roof above.,Gresham College very narrowly escaped the flames of the
Great Fire of London
in 1666; many other buildings were not so lucky. Perhaps the most famous casualty was the medieval
St Paul’s Cathedral
less than a mile away, rebuilt to the designs of its chief architect,
Christopher Wren
.,This may be Wren’s best-known architectural legacy, but he was very much a polymath, having already served as Astronomy Professor at Gresham College and going on to be elected President of the Royal Society in 1680.,Wren and Hooke were both instrumental in surveying and rebuilding London, and they closely collaborated on the design of the nearby
Monument
to the Great Fire. Much more than a memorial, amazingly the Monument was also a scientific instrument. It functioned as a gigantic telescope, with a hatch at the top opening to reveal the heavens which could then be observed all the way from down in the basement.,Air pressure experiments were also conducted inside the Monument’s stairwell using barometers made by
Daniel Quare
, although vibrations from horse-drawn carriages on the surrounding streets made its effectiveness as a site for scientific activity short-lived.,Almost at the Monument’s doorstep is London Bridge, whose predecessor, “Old” London Bridge, was for centuries the capital’s only river crossing. It was joined, further to the west, by a bridge at Westminster built between 1738 and 1750. The construction of
“Old” Westminster Bridge
(for it, too, has since been replaced) was a major engineering spectacle at the time.,A machine powered by horses drove its timber piles, or foundations, 14 feet into the Thames riverbed every hour. This sped up the construction process considerably and the machine’s designer, watchmaker
James Vauloué
, was awarded the Royal Society’s prestigious Copley Medal.,Vauloué’s pile-driving machine was celebrated as a technological innovation. The artist
Samuel Scott
depicted its use at Westminster in several paintings, and print-sellers sold souvenir images of it. Lecturers even used models of the machine to demonstrate the practical applications of mechanical principles for middle- and upper-class audiences interested in natural philosophy, or science.,The arrival of Westminster Bridge led to new developments and improved roads, particularly south of the Thames, and would no doubt have made for a pleasant stroll towards St George’s Fields near Southwark. This was the site of a hot air balloon ascent in 1785, just as aeronautical technology was really beginning to take off (pun intended).,On Wednesday 29 June, the actress
Letitia Ann Sage
became England’s first female aeronaut when she went up in a balloon with a Mr
George Biggin
. Sage later recounted how ‘We arose in a slow and majestic manner, forming a most beautiful object, amidst the acclamations of thousands’.,This spectacular moment was captured in a painting by
Julius Caesar Ibbetson
. It shows the balloon soaring away from its gantry launch while spectators eager for a better view scramble up an obelisk – still standing today at
St George’s Circus
.,Let’s fly eastwards to our final tour destination: the
Tower of London
. The Tower has been an iconic feature of the capital’s skyline since the eleventh century, but its stories of science are less familiar.,Until the early 1800s it was home to the
Royal Mint
where the nation’s coinage was produced.
Isaac Newton
, the great scientific thinker whom we most often associate with the theory of gravity, and himself President of the Royal Society after Wren, was actually Warden and then Master of the Mint between 1696 and 1727. During this time he used scientific techniques to assess the gold and silver content of new coins with unprecedented accuracy.,The Board of Ordnance was also based at the Tower. Its draughtsmen drew up the maps for the first
Ordnance Survey
, carried out between 1791 and 1858. This phenomenal undertaking, which produced the most accurate map of the entire country known at the time, began on
Hounslow Heath
, then on the very western outskirts of London. It was achieved with the help of innovative high-precision measuring instruments, most significantly
Jesse Ramsden’s
theodolite.,We’ve only had time to explore a tiny handful of London’s many historical scientific landmarks on this tour. So look out for more the next time you find yourself in the city – as you’ve just seen, they’re often quite unexpected.,Discover more about the stories and objects featured above in our new permanent gallery –

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/photographing-science-city/,Alexa  Phillips,Photographing Science City,Photographer Kevin Percival discusses his work for Science City 1550– 1800: The Linbury Gallery. ,"At the Museum,Collections and Objects,Exhibitions and Galleries","behind the scenes,photography,science city,Science City 1550-1800: The Linbury Gallery","One of the unique privileges of being a photographer at the Science Museum is that you get to handle objects that made history—like Jesse Ramsden’s theodolite.,Reflecting on his experience of photographing the object, Kevin Percival said: “This is the first time I photographed something and really felt the impact it has had on the world around me. I like walking, and this is the theodolite that was used to produce the first Ordnance Survey maps, which are a world-famous set of walking maps.”,When you’ve spent a year photographing the objects in
Science City: The Linbury Gallery
, it’s hard not to become engrossed in their stories.,The theodolite is part of a diorama-type scene, of which there are several in the gallery. In the scene, the instrument is displayed next to other objects that were used to create the first accurate maps of Great Britain in the late 1700s.,The scenes were proposed by gallery designer Gitta Gschwendtner as a way of evoking the people and places of science in this period. They contain several objects in the collection and show how they would have been used in relation to one another.,“We knew scientific instruments are often difficult to engage with because they can be alien and unfamiliar,” said Alexandra Rose,
Science City
’s lead curator. “We wanted moments where we could animate the objects, bringing them to life.”,The scenes were inspired by museum dioramas but made to look more contemporary by set designer Leila Latchin.,“The digital display echoes the scene in front of you,” Kevin said. “You can click on each object and find out more information about it.”  Because of this, his photographs of the objects had to be shot at the exact same angle as they were placed in the scene.,The digital versions were rendered by Clay Interactive, an interactive media company, with Kevin’s photographs of the objects superimposed on them. He shot the objects on white backgrounds, which made it easy for Clay Interactive to replace the white backgrounds with their digital drawings.,The digital display of the theodolite’s diorama-type scene contains a link to a 3D photograph of it.,To do the shoot, Kevin worked with object handlers Rhys Briggs, Gerry Chatfield and conservator Marisa Kalvins to move it on to a turntable that spins very slowly while it is photographed by a camera. After all sides of the object are captured, software is used to stitch all the photographs together to create a 3D model.,Next to the Theodolite, there’s a 100-link chain, a measuring tool used by surveyors. “The curators weren’t sure how this was going to be displayed,” he says.,They wanted it to be draped down the front of the crate, but the links are not very flexible, so they were going to have to try things during the installation to see what’s possible. However, Clay Interactive had an earlier deadline to finish rendering the scene and the programme, for which they needed Kevin’s photograph.,Kevin took several photographs with different arrangements of the chain, showed the curators the options and they picked one. When the object was later placed on display, they modelled it after Kevin’s photograph.,Although it may look like the chain is holding itself up in the picture, it’s not. Another photographer and one of the curators held up the links using fishing line while Kevin took the shot. Fishing wire is a handy photographic trick because it’s strong, nearly imperceptible and can easily be edited out in post-production.,Kevin’s pictures can be seen on our
online collection site
and on the cover of the
book
that accompanies the gallery opening. Many of the objects in the gallery had never been photographed before.,Discover more about how London grew from a lively capital city to a global hub for trade, commerce, and scientific enquiry in

Cats
was released to
near
universal
critical
panning. “A purr-fectly dreadful hairball of woe” being one prominent review headline of the star-studded film.,Now pray tell, you may be wondering, how does the musical
Cats
relate to the Science Museum?,Well ladies and gentleman, boy and girls, and all other options in between, the connection is – of course – the
Heaviside Layer
.,,In the film and stage version of
Cats
, a group of cats assemble once a year to attend the Jellicle Ball.,The ball is actually a contest where one lucky cat is chosen by Old Deuteronomy (played by Judi Dench in the film) to have a new life by ascending to the Heaviside Layer where that cat is transformed into anything and everything they wanted to be.,Mysterious and unshown, the Heaviside Layer in
Cats
is some sort of heaven or afterlife: “Up up up past the Russell hotel / Up up up to the Heaviside layer”.,But what is the Heaviside layer, why is it in
Cats
and who was Oliver Heaviside?,The Heaviside layer, or to give its correct title, the Kennelly-Heaviside layer, is a layer of the upper atmosphere about 50-90 miles above the Earth’s surface.,It was independently co-proposed by English electrical engineer, physicist and mathematician
Oliver Heaviside
and American electrical engineer
Arthur Kennelly
in 1902.,Oliver Heaviside
(1850-1925) was a self-taught electrical engineer, physicist, mathematician, and
keen cyclist
.,Heaviside was born in poor circumstances in Camden, London in 1850. His education began in a girls’ school run by his mother. Self-taught in Morse code and some aspects of electricity, Heaviside’s career in electrical telegraphy began through family connections.,Heaviside’s aunt Emma West (his mother’s sister) married electrical telegraph pioneer
Charles Wheatstone
. Through this connection, Heaviside became a telegraph clerk and later electrical engineer for the Anglo-Danish Telegraph Company, later the Great Northern Telegraph Company, in Newcastle upon Tyne.,Heaviside worked for the company from 1868 to 1874 when he stopped work in part due to deafness and a decline in general health. Heaviside was also determined to follow a more independent research career – to devote himself to scientific research and electrical theory.,And this he did – with some financial precarity – for the rest of his natural life.,One of the many contributions Heaviside made to electrical engineering and electrical telegraphy was his discovery of the principle of ‘cable loading’, that is how long-distance electrical telegraph and telephone transmission could be improved through the use of ‘loading’ the cable with additional inductance.,This was practically realised through the use of
loading coils
(the above example is on display in our
Information Age
gallery
) first practically developed by Michael Pupin in the USA and later superseded by electronic repeaters.,Heaviside was a brilliant but isolated, difficult and eccentric man who made important theoretical contributions to electrical engineering and physics.,Working mostly independently of the many technical and scientific institutions, he had a difficult and sometimes antagonistic relationship with other scientists and engineers, especially when he thought them beneath his intellectual brilliance.,Additionally, Heaviside’s often-theoretical work was not always appreciated at the time of publication in part due to Heaviside’s sometimes obtuse mathematical writings and use of obscure notation.,The Heaviside Layer,One of the most important contributions Heaviside made for modern telecommunications was his prediction in 1902 of an ionised reflective layer in the atmosphere which would reflect radio signals back to earth.,Independently, American electrical engineer Arthur Kennelly also proposed the existence of such a region in the ionosphere: Kennelly published in March 1902 and Heaviside in December 1902.,The layer became known as the Heaviside or Kennelly-Heaviside layer (it’s now known as the E layer). It is vitally important for
long-distance radio communications
as the layer can be used to bounce radio messages around the world.,The Heaviside layer solved the mystery of how
Marconi’s first transatlantic wireless message
was sent over the horizon from Poldhu in Cornwall, England to a receiving station at St John’s in Newfoundland in December 1901.,The Heaviside layer was also of practical use for long-distance wireless communications networks introduced in the 1920s.,Cats
and the Heaviside layer,So back to our original question: how did the musical
Cats
come to feature the Heaviside layer as some mystical afterlife or heavenly space?  The Heaviside layer was not featured in
T.S. Eliot’s 1939 original
Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats
, a whimsical collection of 14 poems about cats written for children.,Rather, the Heaviside layer appeared in unpublished writings by T.S. Eliot sent to Andrew Lloyd Webber by T.S. Eliot’s widow Valerie Eliot during the writing of the stage musical
Cats
which mentioned the cats eventually go “up up up to the Heaviside Layer”.,The Heaviside Layer would have been familiar to T.S. Eliot. Eliot’s 1939 play
The Family Reunion
, which explores a hero’s journey from guilt to redemption as well as heaven and the afterlife, refers to the Heaviside Layer.,Additionally, in 1947, English scientist Edward Appleton won a Nobel Prize in physics for his contributions to the knowledge of the ionosphere including the Heaviside Layer.,TLDR: The Heaviside layer is not heaven or the afterlife for fictional musical cats but rather a part of the Earth’s atmosphere which can be used to bounce radio waves.,Further reading,Bruton Elizabeth. “From theory to engineering practice: shared telecommunications knowledge between Oliver Heaviside and his brother and GPO engineer Arthur West Heaviside,”

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/in-memoriam-stephen-hawking/,Roger Highfield,Remembering Stephen Hawking,"Stephen Hawking, the best known scientist on planet Earth will be mourned for his remarkable impact, not just on the field of cosmology but as a hugely successful science writer and a beacon of inspiration for how the limitations of the body can be overcome by the power of the mind.",Science in the news,"exploration,physics,space,stephen hawking,time","While his body was immobile, Hawking used his mind to journey through the cosmos, glimpsing the origins of space and time and enthralling tens of millions of people.,,On the morning of 14 March 2018, his children released a statement confirming his death at his home in Cambridge.,Lucy, Robert and Tim, said: “We are deeply saddened that our beloved father passed away today. He was a great scientist and an extraordinary man whose work and legacy will live on for many years. His courage and persistence with his brilliance and humour inspired people across the world.,“He once said: ‘It would not be much of a universe if it wasn’t home to the people you love.’ We will miss him for ever.”,Director of the Science Museum Group, Ian Blatchford said: ‘Stephen was once kind enough to describe the Science Museum,
where he was a Fellow
, as one of his
favourite places
and the feeling was absolutely mutual. He was generous to a fault in supporting our work and in allowing us to join him in seeking to inspire the next generation to look up at the stars.’,Prof Hawking was a great friend of the Science Museum. While giving a US schoolteacher a
personal tour of the museum
in 2015, he said how he had been visiting since his childhood. ”When we were young, my mother used to leave me at the Science Museum, my sister, Mary, at the Natural History Museum, and my younger sister, Philippa, at the Victoria and Albert Museum. At the end of the day, my mother collected us all.”,Dame Mary Archer, Chair of the Science Museum Group Board of Trustees, said: “While Stephen’s work transcended space and time, he was very much a man of this age: he was a wonderful science populariser as well as a very great theoretical physicist.”,Hawking made an enduring impact on popular culture, from his international bestseller, A Brief History of Time, to his appearances in shows as diverse as Star Trek,
the Simpsons
and The Big Bang Theory, and his bets with other physicists, often unsuccessful: in 2012 he lost a $100 bet he made against the discovery of the Higgs Boson, but graciously said that Peter Higgs deserved the Nobel prize.,During his research career, at the University of Cambridge’s Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, Hawking saw his field of cosmology rise from a niche subject in the 1960s to being perhaps the most compelling of all the sciences – not least thanks to his own inspirational contribution.,One of Hawking’s overarching goals has been to take general relativity (
Einstein’s law of gravity
), which controls the large scale structure of the universe, and blend it with quantum theory, which rules the world of atoms, molecules and the very small, to produce a grand theory of everything, known as quantum gravity.,Hawking first caught the attention of his peers in the late 1960s, working with Roger Penrose on how general relativity sometimes breaks down, resulting in something called a singularity. In the case of a collapsing over-massive star, densities would become infinite in a singularity – giving us the essence of what we now refer to as a “black hole”.,They showed that such singularities must occur inside black holes – and, most probably, at the start of the universe. This idea implies that singularities mark the beginning and end of space and time, which was created during the Big Bang and breaks down within black holes.,In his most famous work, Hawking raised the intriguing possibility that black holes are not as black as once thought. The reason is down to one strange consequence of quantum theory: empty space isn’t empty at all: pairs of particles are constantly popping into and out of existence. If they appear on the border of event horizon – the point of no return from the gravity well of a black hole, as described by general relativity – they may find themselves on different sides, with one sucked in, and the other becoming part of “Hawking radiation”.,If the paradoxical glow of Hawking radiation had been detected from a black hole during his lifetime, Hawking would have won the Nobel prize.,The same mathematics can also be applied to the ‘echo of the Big Bang’ which took place 13.7 billion years ago, the splash of residual microwaves that still warm today’s universe,  and to the way in which a soup of ultra-hot matter crystallised to form the visible universe.,In spring 1982, Hawking made a radical proposal: that fluctuations in the cosmic background radiation could be traced back to Hawking radiation, as the tiny seeds around which the large scale structure of the universe coalesced.,That summer, this “fluctuation theory” was developed at a workshop organised by Hawking and his colleague Gary Gibbons. Remarkably, their efforts – and those of two Russians who came up with the same result independently – predicted these fluctuations in the fabric of the cosmos a decade before a purpose-built satellite called COBE observed them in the heavens.,With James Hartle, Hawking also developed in the early 1980s the “no-boundary” idea, whereby the singularity of the Big Bang is replaced by the history of the universe as a sphere, like our own Earth, where time corresponds to latitude, starting with zero at the North Pole and progressing southward. When asked what happened before the Big Bang, Hawking said it was like asking what was north of the North Pole — it was not any place, or any time.,I first met Hawking in Berkeley, California, when he was giving a lecture to promote A Brief History of Time. He was greeted like a rock star of science, with main and satellite venues groaning with people who found his personal story inspirational, transforming from a lazy student into the world’s best known scientist who, as a result of motor neurone disease, has only the use of a few muscles.,It was in 1963, then a bright, ambitious, 21-year-old PhD student at Cambridge, that Hawking was told that he had a type of motor neurone disease (today we know it as an unusual form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) and was given about two years to live. His illness was degenerative: it would attack the nerves that controlled his muscles, affecting first his body, then eventually his mood, senses and thinking.,Personally and professionally, Hawking has travelled light years since that shattering diagnosis. He has never complained, or shown any signs of self-pity: he initially coped, he says, by listening to Wagner. “Reports in magazine articles that I drank heavily are an exaggeration.”,What gave him something to live for was meeting Jane Wilde, a languages student, whom he married in 1965. The advance of his disease slowed, and he threw himself into his research, turning from a brilliant but lazy student into a workaholic.,But as Hawking’s career was advancing, so was his disease. In 1983, the BBC’s Horizon showed how his speech had become slurred and hard to decipher. Soon, a tracheotomy left him unable to speak at all: the only way he could communicate was by raising his eyebrows to select letters as they were held up on cards.,By 1988 Hawking was using the
speech synthesiser
that has since given him his trademark American accent. For the past few years, he has operated the device by twitching a cheek muscle – but even when I interviewed him in front of an audience 15 or so years ago, it would take him minutes to give prepared answers. His sparkling one-liners – he wouldn’t compare the joy of discovery to sex, he says, but it does last longer – are as much a product of necessity as is his humour.,In 2012 as part of the Science Museum’s celebration of
Stephen Hawking’s 70th birthday
, marked by an exhibition and portrait
by David Hockney
,
leading contemporaries
paid tribute to his remarkable impact on the field of cosmology:,Prof Nima Arkani-Hamed, Institute for Advanced Study,Princeton, said: “Hawking’s revolutionary discovery that black holes radiate was the first spectacular result in quantum gravity, suggesting a startling unification of space-time, quantum mechanics and thermodynamics that has set much of the agenda for fundamental physics in the past four decades. It is impossible to overstate how profound these ideas are, how influential they have been, and how they continue to drive our 21st century quest to more deeply understand the nature of space-time and quantum mechanics.”,His colleague at the Institute, Ed Witten, added that Hawkings’ discovery of black hole evaporation was a very special insight. “By now it influences work in many areas of physics – heavy ion physics, quantum critical phenomena in condensed matter physics, cosmology, and of course the search for a fundamental understanding of quantum gravity, which was Stephen’s original motivation.”,Martin Rees, Astronomer Royal, added: “Stephen Hawking’s name will life in the annals of science because he has probably done as much as anyone else since Einstein to extend our grasp of gravity, space and time; millions have had their cosmic horizons widened by his bestselling books; and even more, around the world, have been inspired by a unique example of achievement against all the odds – a manifestation of amazing willpower and determination.”,In 2012, James Lovelock, our most famous independent scientist,
recalled
meeting Stephen Hawking as a baby, cradling him in his arms. In 2013, Hawking visited the museum for the opening of our Collider exhibition, where
he met Professor Peter Higgs
and in 2015 Hawking visited again, sharing
his views on space exploration
.,Hawking will be mourned now not just for his science but for his cosmic force of will that saw him defy a devastating diagnosis for more than half a century.,And that, indeed, sums up his life: he is a man who has defied the laws of medicine to rewrite the laws of physics and touch the heart of millions."
https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/remembering-james-watt/,Ben Russell,Remembering James Watt,We explore the life and work of James Watt. ,"Collections and Objects,Exhibitions and Galleries","engineering,science","James Watt, born in Greenock Scotland, is best known for turning the steam engine from a clumsy and highly wasteful machine into one that was both highly efficient and built with precision.,The ‘Great Steamer’, as his engine was affectionately known,
was one of the key driving forces in the Industrial Revolution
, providing power on demand to drive the mills and factories that made this country the workshop of the world.,Watt’s life of projects went far beyond steam engines and is fascinating in itself
– as well as engines, he was a maker of scientific and musical instruments, he worked in a pottery, was a surveyor and civil engineer, a chemist, and an artist.,After an extremely busy life, Watt continued to be a hugely influential figure and was
the first engineer to have a monument erected in Westminster Abbey
.,Unfortunately, the enormous statue was so big that the floor cracked open when it was installed. Due to the monument being too controversial and out of scale with its surroundings, it eventually had to be moved elsewhere.,During the years following his death, his son,
James Jnr
, devoted huge efforts to promote his father’s achievements, artfully shaping how his legacy was presented in published books and biographies.,The result; different interest groups used Watt as an example of how science, craft, and engineering underpinned the prosperity Britain enjoyed in the nineteenth-century.,The Science Museum Group has
built a collection of Watt-related objects
over the years ranging from four of his steam engines to his extensive sculpture collection and personal library.,The oldest surviving Watt engine Old Bess joined the collection in 1861 and is
currently on display in our Energy Hall
.,Shortly after this, the museum acquired Watt’s alleged ‘philosophising steam kettle’, associated with the story that Watt’s steam projects were inspired by watching a boiling kettle.,Even his
old house in Birmingham, Heathfield
, was envisaged as a living memorial to the man. Although this came to nothing, the Science Museum finally acquired
Watt’s complete workshop in 1924
, after a 60-year campaign of letter-writing and even the construction of model engines for Watt’s descendants in order to oil the wheels of negotiation.,The workshop is a unique physical record of Watt’s life and work
, an industrial shrine, a place where even the preservation of the dust was considered with reverence.,Today Watt is no longer as prominent a figure as he once was, although he was featured with his business partner on the
last version of the Bank of England’s £50 note
.,Some commentators have even associated his engine with the
Anthropocene
; the geological era bearing the direct imprint of man’s activities on the global environment.,The effects of our immense energy consumption since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution are now being felt and reacted to, but they go far beyond anything Watt himself could ever have envisioned.,The curiosity, creativity, and productivity of Watt and his contemporaries will be invaluable in confronting the issues that face us.,Read more about Watt’s workshop in this

electric taxis
. We tend to think of electric cars as futuristic, especially in a bid to cut emissions but they have a much older history.,With a top speed of 9-12 mph, Walter Bersey’s taxis were the first self-propelled vehicles for hire on London’s roads. Cars on London’s roads got off to a slow start in Britain thanks to the “Red Flag Act” which stated that any vehicle other than a horse drawn must be preceded by a man carting a red flag as a warning to passers-by. Once repealed in November 1896, vehicles began to make their mark in Britain. The origins of the now annual London to Brighton road race have their roots in celebrating the repeal of the law.,Walter Bersey shared the ideas that there were great hopes for electricity. He said:,“There is no apparent limit to the hopes and expectations of the electric artisans…..in short [it] is the natural power which shall be the most intimate and effective of all man’s assets.”,,Exhibited at a South Kensington motor show in 1896, 12 electric cabs,
the Berseys
first appeared on the road on 19 August 1897. When the taxis were first unveiled, they undertook the London-Brighton race. According to reports, the taxis could not complete the 60 mile journey and completed part of the race by train.,Rates were the same as horse drawn cabs. The cab could take two passengers and was fitted with electric lighting both inside and out. Electric illumination was not welcomed by all “for the comfort of people of a bashful disposition……[who felt] as conspicuous as if they were on the stage with the limelight.” The then Prince of Wales was said to have taken a taxi ride in a Bersey.,Each taxi was licensed by Scotland Yard under four conditions:,1. each vehicle was accompanied by a driver
2. drivers were capable of stopping the carriage on demand
3. the taxi could turn in a small space
4. be able to climb the steepest hill in London, Savoy Hill,The Bersey was known as the “Hummingbird” from the sound of the taxi and the yellow and black livery. Batteries were replaced using a hydraulic lifting system that took 2-3 minutes at the sole re-charging station in London. Electricity was expensive to generate so the company started producing their own at great expense.,However, after 6 months of use, the noise and vibration escalated. Vibrations damaged the delicate glass plates, the tyres wore out incredibly quickly given the 2 tonne weight of the cab. Breakdowns were frequent. Horse drawn cabs were often faster as well.,Two years after their debut the Bersey taxis disappeared from the roads. Taxis were not only vehicles Walter Bersey designed. He designed a range of private electric vehicles but none are know to have survived."

","Collections and Objects,Science in the news","chemistry,Marie-Anne Paulze,women in science","Marie-Anne Paulze was born on 20 January 1758 in Montbrison, a town in France’s Loire region that is well known for its eponymous blue cheese. She lost her mother when she was just three years old. Shortly after, she was sent to a convent for her education.,Paulze’s father, Jacque, worked for a tax collection company for the French monarchy. When his daughter was twelve, he received an unwelcome marriage proposal from the powerful and very elderly Count d’Amerval.,With threats of losing his job, Jacque successfully blocked the proposal by means of arranging another, with a younger, more suitable bachelor – his colleague, Antoine Lavoisier.,Despite the contrived nature of their marriage, Paulze and Lavoisier were well matched. Lavoisier was a chemist, and Paulze immediately took a keen interest in his work, determined to learn more about the field and join her husband in the laboratory.,Paulze received formal training in chemistry from Lavoisier’s colleagues and she also studied drawing under the famed French artist, Jacques Louis David. Later, Paulze commissioned a double portrait of her and Lavoisier, which the above engraving is based on.,Such was her talent for drawing, that she produced the thirteen copperplate illustrations for Lavoisier’s seminar work,
Traité Élémentaire de Chimie
(1789), which laid the foundations of modern chemistry and the chemical elements as we know them now. (The Science Museum holds
a first edition.
),As well as illustrating, Paulze collaborated with her husband, observing experiments and recording laboratory notes – a part of the scientific process that was depicted in her illustrations.,The Science Museum has in its collection a diorama based on this illustration, made by the Wellcome Institute, sometime between 1945 and 1965, when such museum display techniques were in vogue.,The illustration (and diorama) depicts one of a series of experiments on the chemistry and physiology of respiration carried out by the Lavoisiers and their collaborators.,This scene features Antoine Lavoisier, in wig and tailcoat, stood at the table. A physician (possibly Scotsman Hugh Gillan) is taking the pulse of a topless man (chemist
Armand Séguin
), who is wearing a copper face mask attached to a circulatory breathing apparatus while operating a pedal. Paulze can be seen note-taking.,The scientific interpretation of this experiment and the apparatus, which you can see varies slightly from the original illustration, has confounded historians.,But the general project of this series of experiments was to measure and understand the roles of oxygen and carbon dioxide – gases that had been recently discovered – in respiration.,These respiration experiments were carried out at the Lavoisiers’ home laboratory at the Paris Arsenal. The Lavoisiers worked under a strict regime: 6.00 – 9.00 and 19.00 – 21.00 weekdays; and morning and lunch in the laboratory Saturdays, with theoretical discussions in the afternoon.,Paulze played a vital role in the promotion of their work to the international scientific community, editing publications and keeping her husband Lavoisier abreast of the latest developments.,Unlike Lavoisier, she mastered languages, translating key chemical works, such as those of British chemists Joseph Priestley and Henry Cavendish. Her annotations and comments speak to the depth of her chemical knowledge.,For these reasons, she deserves a place alongside her husband for the successful dissemination of the oxygen theory of combustion (oxidation), which replaced the prevailing
phlogiston theory
, favoured by the Brits. It would form the basis of the modern classification of the chemical elements.,The Lavoisiers’ marriage did not have a happy ending. Due to his career with the Royal Tax Collectors, Lavoisier was not spared the fate of many of the aristocratic class during the Terrors of the French Revolution. He was guillotined in 1794, at the height of his scientific career.,After her husband’s execution, Paulze organised the publication of his final work,
Memoires de Chimie
. She authored the preface when his long-time collaborator Séguin (the topless, masked chemist in the diorama) refused to criticise the revolutionaries responsible for Lavoisier’s death.,The affection they shared was evident in the last letter Paulze received from her imprisoned husband on 7 May 1794:,My dearest friend … Be careful not to sacrifice your health, for that would be the greatest misfortune. … I have always enjoyed a happy life. You have made it so …,She did marry again, to another scientific luminary, the physicist Benjamin Thomson, better known as Count Rumford. But it did not last long, the couple divorcing after two months.,Paulze described Rumford as ‘the theoretical liberal’ who in practice was a ‘domestic tyrant’. Rumford’s own assessment was they were both too independent – he was used to getting his way and did not share the same sense of collaboration as Paulze’s first husband.,The pair did once have an amusing public feud. Paulze invited a large number of guests to their Paris home against the wishes of Rumford. Rumford responded by locking the gates and hiding the key. She ended up conversing with them through the gates, and in retaliation pouring boiling water on Rumford’s prized flowers.,Paulze’s later years were occupied by charitable work, but her legacy as a chemist lives on through the work she achieved in her former life together with Lavoisier."

In his own words:,If all the elements are arranged in the order of their atomic weights, a periodic repetition of properties is obtained. This is … the law of periodicity.,Our new display includes an 1869 print of the journal containing Mendeleev’s first published periodic table. This is the first time the print has gone on display at the museum since it joined the
Science Museum Group Collection
in 1980.,This
early attempt
looks unlike the modern form of the periodic table, as the chemical symbols for the elements are arranged by weight downwards rather than across.,In the table on display you can see the gaps Mendeleev left for elements yet-to-be-discovered, where he placed a question mark and a predicted weight.,These gaps were one of the reasons Mendeleev and his table became internationally famous, as three of his predictions were vindicated when the elements were discovered – gallium in 1875, scandium in 1879, and germanium 1886.,While
not the first to put forward a periodic table
, it was his that endured, forming the basis of the
one we know today
, as it evolved over the next 150 years.,Mendeleev conceived of his system to classify the elements at a time when only 60 or so chemical elements were known – about half of today’s count.,Just twenty years after Mendeleev published his periodic table, French politician and linguist Prince Louis Lucien Bonaparte had amassed a collection of the then-known elements. If his surname seems familiar, it is because he’s better known as Napoleon’s nephew.,Prince Louis was probably one of the first to collect elements as a hobby, and
over 50 of his elements
are included in our new display.,From
shimmering silver to radioactive uranium
, Prince Louis collected as many of the known elements as he could and bottled them in purpose-made glass jars, etched with their corresponding chemical symbol.,Many of the elements are original samples acquired by Prince Louis, though some have altered over time, reacting with the oxygen in the air. Mercury, once a silvery liquid, has become the yellowish-brown coloured mercury oxide. It is the same oxidation process which causes iron to rust.,Prince Louis was likely inspired by Mendeleev, wishing to possess all the basic ingredients of matter that Mendeleev’s table classified.,He bequeathed his collection of elements to the
South Kensington Museum
, the predecessor of the
Science Museum
and
V&A
, in 1892. His decision to make this gift was based on a visit he made to the museum in 1890 to view its metallurgical specimens.,They were first exhibited in 1906, three years before the Science Museum came into official existence. Twenty years later, these elements formed the centrepiece of a chemistry gallery in a periodic table display.,This remained in place for decades. The neurologist and author Oliver Sacks recounts his visits as a child in his memoirs
Uncle Tungsten
:,‘seeing the table .. altered my life. I took to visiting it as often as I could. … It was like a garden … the enchanted garden of Mendeleev’,The Science Museum’s last periodic table display opened in 1964, featuring a giant interactive table. The Bonaparte elements shifted from the centrepiece to an accompanying showcase.,The Bonaparte elements are now back on public display after a 30-year absence, arranged according to the present form of the periodic table which is familiar to many.,Perhaps they might enchant a new generation with their alluring materiality and the simplicity of the system that classifies them.,The Science Museum is celebrating the

involves studying and photographing the collection so we better understand the items we care for in the
Science Museum Group Collection
.,As you might imagine, items relating to chemistry in the collection often contain
hazardous substances
. Indeed, there is probably no such thing as risk-free chemistry, as
Frances Mary Gore Micklethwait
(1867- 25 March 1950) would have known.,Working under
Martha Annie Whiteley
at Imperial College, Micklethwait was part of an all-female team of chemists investigating chemical weapons, including mustard gas, during the First World War.,One anecdote holds that Micklethwait and her colleagues would test the mustard gas on themselves, studying the blisters that erupted on their skin. In 1919, Micklethwait was awarded an MBE for this secret war work.,It was through identifying chemical hazards in the collection that I first came across Micklethwait. While researching certain chemical substances and how they joined the collection, I found that the objects had been made by Dr G. T. Morgan and Miss Frances Micklethwait.,Between 1904 and 1914, Micklethwait collaborated with
Sir Gilbert Thomas Morgan
at the Royal College of Science (later Imperial College London). Their research included the study of azobenzene compounds, often used as dyes.,Making small changes to the
chemical structure of azobenzene
causes different wavelengths of light to be absorbed, meaning that the colour of the dye can be altered. The
fruits of their collaboration
are looked after by the Science Museum Group, but until now their makers were not recorded.,Today (25 March) marks the anniversary of Micklethwait’s death.,As
Patricia Fara
notes, the research for which Micklethwait was awarded an MBE was necessarily secret, which helps explain why little was known about her. Even the year of Micklethwait’s birth is debated.,Micklethwait has no entry in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (just over 5% of science and technology biographies in the ODNB are for women currently). Yet according to
Marelene and Geoff Rayner-Canham
, Micklethwait was “one of the most prolific women authors” among her contemporaries. Between 1904 and 1906, Micklethwait published three papers a year on average in the Journal of the Chemical Society.,Now thanks to new research as part of our
ambitious project
to move 300,000 objects to their new home, one more woman is represented in the

",Exhibitions and Galleries,churchill's scientists,"The British statesman had a variety of siren suits, which he referred to as ‘romper suits,’ including sombre, military-style suits, as well as more extravagant pin-striped and velvet versions. Its primary purpose was simply so Churchill could slip it over his clothes in the event of an air raid.,There are only three original Winston Churchill siren suits known to be in existence, including a green velvet garment created by Turnbull & Asser. Churchill reportedly returned his siren suits to the Jermyn Street shirt-maker for repair on several occasions – damaged not through enemy action but by cigar burns.,It would seem that the former Prime Minister had developed something of a penchant for the outfit, opting to sport it for the most formal of occasions. Churchill wore one of these suits on a visit to the White House, Washington, in December 1941. At a press conference that week,
Mrs Roosevelt
declared she was having one made for her husband.,After the war, Churchill wore a siren suit again when he sat for sculptor Oscar Nemon in the 1950s. After the sittings, he gave the suit to Nemon as a souvenir. Small splashes of red paint on the trousers suggested Churchill also wore it whilst painting.,Due to Churchill’s rather large proportions, Turnbull & Asser have commissioned a bespoke mannequin to display the unique garment in the Science Museum. Expertly built using a fibreglass frame, the mannequin is covered in padding to mimic the former Prime Minister’s body shape, bringing the siren suit to life.,For those wishing,to emulate the British bulldog’s style, Turnbull & Asser are due to launch a Churchill-inspired capsule collection to mark the 50th anniversary of his death this year, celebrating a great man, whose bold style and strong leadership inspired a nation.,You can see the green velvet siren suit on display together with the cigar Churchill smoked on the evening of the 1951 election when he heard he had been re-elected as Prime Minister.,Martin Wise is an archivist at

","At the Museum,Collections and Objects,Research","chemistry,chemistry festival","With this year being the
International Year of the Periodic Table
, it’s an exciting time to be a chemist. People around the world are celebrating the birth of one of the most elegant and impressive organising principles of nature. The building blocks that make up everything we know are displayed through Mendeleev’s iconic chart that graces the walls of almost every chemistry classroom, lecture hall and textbook.,But the periodic table that we all know now is not static, fixed or unchangeable and is far from perfect. The current form is known to have its flaws. For example, the block design that arranges the elements by columns and rows breaks the continuity between the elements as you move from one period to the next. Another criticism is the fact that the two rows below the main table, called the lanthanides and actinides, appear as an awkward addition.,In some ways, it falls short in demonstrating ‘periodicity’ – the idea of recurring trends between elements when arranged in order of increasing atomic number.,Because of these flaws, scientists and educators have strived to make new and original representations of the periodic system using a range of forms, from spirals and helices to spheres and tetrahedrons. There’s even a database (
see here
), that contains hundreds of different versions.,For my dissertation project at University College London, I’ve been diving into the Science Museum Group’s collection, tracing the history of alternative versions of the periodic table.,I’m interested in how three-dimensional models like this Spiral Periodic Table allow us to learn about the complex relationships between the elements.,Supported by poles and twisting around itself in a snake-like manner, this object is one of many weird and interesting forms of the periodic table. It was built at the Royal Military College of Science in 1963. The Science Museum asked for this model to be made for them to display in their new chemistry gallery after the original model was seen at an exhibition held by the Physical Society.,This is a very dynamic and interesting way to depict the elements. Because it is displayed as a spiral, there is a continuity between elements that is not achieved with the two-dimensional table.,This model
, housed in a wooden cabinet, is a physical realisation of arguably one of the first periodic systems to ever be created. It was made by the Science Museum’s workshops in 1925, based on the periodic spiral of Alexandre de Chancourtois, a French geologist, who conceived it in 1862.,The elements are plotted in order of atomic weight on a line that twists around a cylinder at an angle of 45 degrees. It comes with a dial that allows you to rotate the cylinder inside.,It is possible that because he was a geologist, de Chancourtois was inspired to demonstrate periodicity in a drum and stick model similar to those used to measure earthquakes.,This ‘pretzel-shaped’ model, was made by Sir William Crookes in 1888.  As well as showing the relationships between chemicals, he wished to also show their evolution, which originated from what he called ‘primal matter’ in the stars. When cooled, it began to form the elements starting with the lightest, hydrogen, at the top of his table, down to uranium, the heaviest at the bottom.,More recent versions have been created for teaching purposes. One is a tree-like structure created by the Canadian chemist Ferdinand Dufour. By looking downwards from above, you can see what is known as ‘secondary periodicity’, which are hidden relationships between elements that might be further away from each other than in the traditional periodic table.,Another, is the
Periodic Round Table
, created by Gary Katz. It exhibits a symmetry and regularity that the other tables do not provide. Both models can be taken apart and reassembled, providing opportunities for tactile learning.,﻿,But why visualise the periodic table in three dimensions?,With 3D tables, we can touch them, walk around them, and in some cases even build them. They provide us with new and dynamic ways to learn about the elements, see new relationships between them, and have the potential to inspire curiosity.,This is not at all to say that we should abandon the current periodic table, but perhaps we should embrace more dynamic forms of the periodic table in our labs and classrooms to better learn about and investigate the complexities behind chemistry.,Discover more about the evolution of the periodic table

It is referred to as a livery company, a term that dates back to medieval times when different trades set up associations created to control the quality and pricing of a product.,One of the most important aspects of livery companies is their role in ensuring the continuance of trade through apprenticeships, training and upskilling. WCSIM was formed to further the craft of scientific instrument making through the sharing of ideas, networking and research. It now supports and encourages students to take up STEM subjects to bridge the current skills gap.,,The Worshipful Company’s coat of arms – Newton and Faraday support the shield on which are found pyramidical cubes in the form of an optical illusion and above that, the head of Minerva. Credit: WCSIM.We first began working with members from the Worshipful Company in April 2018. The Science City team were keen to collaborate with them on this project as it was an opportunity to connect the scientific instruments of the past with young makers of today. Although we are now over 200 years past the timeline of the Science City gallery the idea of transferring skills through apprenticeships and the practice of scientific instrument making are still very active today.,In March last year as the project continued to develop, we went to
Machines Room
which is a maker-space that facilitates experimental ways of making, very different from what this particular group were used to. Participants had a chance to train on the machines and software that some makers of today are using. This experience added another element to the project by comparing the future of making to the scientific instruments and methods of making that they were seeing in the contents of

Ian Levy
, technical director of the
National Cyber Security Centre, NCSC
.,Last week, at the Cheltenham Science Festival, in an event chaired by Roger Highfield, Science Director of the Science Museum, Levy highlighted the need for cyber defenders who think in different ways.,Levy took the packed audience through the current state of cyber security in the form of the
National Cyber Security Strategy
that highlighted that the NCSC took down almost 140,000 UK websites that were crafted to look like those of banks, government agencies and businesses last year alone.,This talk ranged from the activities of what he called ‘adequate pernicious toerags’ (also known as the ‘hacker in a hoodie’) to a state-run campaign by the GRU, the Russian military intelligence service, of
indiscriminate and reckless cyber attacks targeting political institutions, businesses, media, and sport.,He also highlighted the details of attacks such as the global WannaCry ransomware attack of 2017, which targeted computers running the Microsoft Windows operating system by encrypting data and demanding ransom payments in the Bitcoin cryptocurrency: Levy went on to show the simple coding error that led to the vulnerability that made it possible.,Levy encouraged the audience to use
password managers
so they could create more sophisticated passwords. He explained that the NCSC and Troy Hunt, creator of
Have I Been Pwned
, recently found that the most commonly used passwords in global cyber breaches were ‘12345’ (affecting 23.2 million accounts) and ‘qwerty’ (affecting 3.8 million accounts). He also looked to the future, and mentioned that the “‘
Internet of Things
’, which envisages everyday objects going online, can become the Internet of Tragedies if we get it wrong.”,But of all of his concerns, the number one worry was a stark lack of diversity on the cyber front line. In 2017, a
Frost and Sullivan report
estimated that for every woman working globally in cyber security, you will find nine men. Hence why the NCSC is finding the next generation of cyber defenders by appealing to a more diverse audience. To achieve this, they have introduced the
CyberFirst
programme that will help young people explore their passion for technology by introducing them to the world of cyber security.,Yesterday, 10 June 2019, the UK Government

MI5 released files to the National Archives
about the Portland Spy Ring, revealing that one of the Soviet Union’s most successful spy rings in the UK could have been caught four years earlier if the Admiralty had listened to the ex-wife of one of spy ring’s members.,In January 1961, all five members of the Portland Spy Ring were arrested simultaneously and their homes searched for spycraft. Elaborate equipment for hiding and transmitting secret messages had been disguised around their homes, much of which is on display for the first time in our free
Top Secret
exhibition
, which runs at the Science Museum until 23 February 2020.,The spy ring had been smuggling copies of top-secret British naval documents from the Admiralty Underwater Research Establishment at Portland, including details of the UK’s nuclear submarine programme, and passing them onto Soviet Russia. The spy ring was foiled by a collaboration between the police and Britain’s intelligence agencies, including MI5 and
GCHQ
.,Two members of the spy ring, Helen and Peter Kroger, appeared to be an ordinary Canadian couple living in an unremarkable London suburb. But this seemingly conventional husband and wife were living undercover. In fact, they were spies, smuggling top-secret British documents to the Soviet Union using tiny dots called ‘microdots’ – documents and photographs shrunk down to the size of a full stop – hidden in books and letters.,The top-secret British documents they were sharing with the Soviet Union included designs for
HMS Resolution
, Britain’s first submarine equipped with nuclear ballistic missiles developed at the naval research base at Portland, Dorset. From the early 1950s, Harry Houghton and Ethel Gee worked at the base as civilian employees. A drunkard with money problems, Houghton, passed on the top-secret naval documents to spy ring master Gordon Lonsdale, a Soviet illegal named Konon Molody pretending to be a Canadian businessman. In turn, Lonsdale passed them on to the Krogers for transmission to Moscow.,As revealed in the documents released from MI5 to the National Archives, in 1955 Houghton’s soon-to-be ex-wife Alice Houghton contacted staff at the Admiralty with concerns that her husband was stealing naval documents and had been compromised as a Soviet spy, in part because he suddenly had access to large amounts of money.,At this time, Alice and Harry Houghton were going through a nasty separation and later divorce. The newly released files also reveal that Houghton beat his wife and even tried to kill her in 1954 by pushing her off a cliff at Portland Bill, only to be interrupted by passersby.,Unfortunately, Alice Houghton’s three separate warnings to Admiralty were dismissed as “outpourings of a disgruntled and jealous wife … made in the spur of the moment and out of pure spite.”,With Houghton’s ex-wife’s warnings dismissed, the spy ring continued to operate for another four years until their arrest in January 1961. All five members of the spy ring were convicted and received long sentences, ranging from 15 to 25 years, although Gordon Lonsdale and the Krogers were exchanged for Britons accused of spying in the Soviet Union. Until they were caught, the Portland Spy Ring was one of the most successful spy rings to operate in Cold War Britain.,In March 1961, two months after the spy ring had been arrested, the future Director General of MI5
Martin Furnival Jones
admitted that the spy ring could have been discovered much earlier if the security services properly investigated Alice Houghton’s reports.,In a 1961 memo, from the newly released National Archives files, he observed:,“Looking at it dispassionately now I think it is clear that we ought to have carried out some investigation in 1956,” he wrote. “If we had done so there is a fair chance that we would have unearthed Houghton’s espionage and the probability is that we would have discovered that he was being controlled as a spy by a member of the Soviet Embassy.”,This was originally posted in support of our

Top Secret: From Ciphers to Cyber Security
is the number of original artefacts that have been gathered into one place. A particularly fascinating item is the radio transmitter used by Soviet spies, Peter and Helen Kroger, to inform Moscow that top secret British naval secrets were on their way to them.,Money. Blackmail. Ideology. Love. You’ll find any one of these at the heart of a good spy story. In 1961, when the
Portland Spy Scandal
broke in the news all four of these were at play.,Let us start in 1951 with Harry Houghton, a clerk in the Defence Attaché’s office in the British Embassy in Warsaw, Poland, a Cold War ally of the Soviet Union. Allegedly, Houghton
had problems with alcohol
, which led to his being transferred out of the Embassy and sent back to Britain. His liking for alcohol had been noticed by the Polish Secret Service, too, so when he returned to Britain, the Soviet secret police (
the KGB
), contacted him and offered him money for information from his new place of work – the
Admiralty Underwater Weapons Establishment at Portland, Dorset.,The other key players in the Portland Spy Ring were Peter and Helen Kroger (real names Morris and Lona Cohen). The Krogers were American communists who had worked for the Soviet Union throughout the 1940s, passing US military secrets to Moscow,
including details of the first atomic bomb.,Fearing exposure they fled in 1950, during which time Mrs. Kroger was trained as a radio operator and cipher clerk. In 1954 they moved to London and settled in a bungalow in Ruislip, West London, with Mr. Kroger opening an antiquarian book business.,The link between Houghton and the Krogers was Gordon Lonsdale (real name Konon Molody). Lonsdale was a KGB agent, who had first worked with the Krogers in America. In England, he was appointed by the KGB as Houghton’s handler. Houghton, however, only had access to low-grade information, so he was encouraged to start a relationship with Ethel Gee, a middle-aged woman working as a filing clerk with access to highly classified secrets. Flattered by Houghton’s attentions, the two began a relationship and Gee later agreed to help him obtain top secret information.,Houghton, sometimes accompanied by Gee, made regular monthly visits to London to pass information to Lonsdale, either as printed documents or on rolls of film. He was paid well for this. Lonsdale would then take the documents and the film to the Krogers’ house in Ruislip. The Krogers then used the transmitter, which is featured in
Top Secret
, to notify Moscow that they were sending classified secrets, concealed in microdots, inside Mr. Kroger’s antiquarian books.,In 1959, a Polish double-agent codenamed ‘Sniper’ told his American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) handler that he had seen secret naval information from Britain. When the CIA passed this on to MI5, it was clear that the information could have come only from Portland. Discreet investigations soon discovered the source of the information. Houghton fell under suspicion, as his extravagant lifestyle was clearly way beyond the salary he was being paid.,Surveillance of Houghton revealed the regular trips to London to meet Lonsdale. Lonsdale was then observed making frequent visits to the Krogers’ home in Ruislip. MI5 hoped that by continuing this surveillance they would be able to find other members of the spy ring or other spies whom Lonsdale was handling. But in early January 1961 ‘Sniper’ found that his cover had been blown.,Worried that the spies might realise that they had been discovered, MI5 had to act quickly. On 7 January 1961, when Houghton and Gee handed Lonsdale a shopping bag containing secret information, they were arrested by Special Branch officers. At the same time, detectives were knocking on the door of the Krogers’ home. After they were arrested a search of the house revealed the radio set; a 22-metre long aerial in the loft, which they would use for making short burst signals to Moscow at night-time; microdots and other espionage equipment; and a substantial sum of money, used for paying people such as Houghton.,The case against all five suspects – Houghton, Gee, Lonsdale, and the Krogers –
was brought to trial two months later.
Despite their pleas of ‘not guilty’ they were all found guilty and sentenced to long prison terms: Lonsdale was given 25 years; the Krogers, 20 years; and Houghton and Gee 15 years each.,Three years later Lonsdale was exchanged for Greville Wynne, a British businessman being held in Moscow because of his contacts with a Soviet double-agent, Oleg Penkovsky. Lonsdale died in Moscow in 1970 in suspicious circumstances, aged 48.,In 1969, the Krogers were exchanged for Gerald Brooke, a British subject who had been imprisoned in Russia in 1965 for distributing anti-Soviet leaflets in the USSR. In the 1990s, after the collapse of the Soviet Union,
the Krogers were both awarded the title of ‘Hero of the Russian Federation’.
Helen Kroger/Lona Cohen died in 1992, aged 79,
and her husband, Peter Kroger/Morris Cohen, in 1995, aged 85.,Harry Houghton and Ethel Gee were granted early release from prison in 1970, having served nine years. They married a year later. Perhaps this represented some kind of happy ending for Gee. Houghton died in 1985, aged 84, a year after Gee, who was 70 at the time of her death.,This was originally posted in support of our

Roger Highfield, Science Director, talks to cosmonaut Alexei Leonov, who trained to be the first to walk on the Moon.",Science in the news,"#Apollo50,Apollo 11,cosmonauts,exploration,public history,space","Sixty years ago, it seemed inevitable that the USSR would be the first to land a human on the Moon.,Earlier, on 4 October 1957, the USSR had successfully launched the
Sputnik satellite
into Earth’s orbit and the “beep beep beep” of
Sputnik’s telemetry shook the world.,More firsts quickly followed for the USSR, with Yuri Gagarin becoming the first human in space on 12 April 1961,
Valentina Tereshkova
became the first woman in space in 1963, the Voskhod 1 carried the first multiple-person crew into space in 1964 and the
first spacewalk
was carried out by Alexei Leonov in 1965.,Because the USSR lunar lander could only be entered by someone who had undertaken a spacewalk, Leonov became an ideal candidate for this mission. At this time, the Sea of Tranquility, where Apollo 11 touched down in July 1969, had even been selected as a potential USSR landing site.,Despite the USSR’s isolation from the West, Leonov was well aware of President John F Kennedy’s 1961 speech which launched America’s Apollo Moon programme.,,Russian fascination with space long predates that of America. In the later years of the 19th century,
cosmism, emerged in Russia
led by
Nikolai Fedorov (1829-1903)
, blending ideas from Western and Eastern philosophy along with those of the Russian Orthodox church to ponder the origin, evolution, and future of the cosmos.,While newborn NASA first pondered a lunar programme
in November 1959
, the year before
Sergei Korolev
(1907-1966, the master architect of the USSR’s space successes), had already outlined a Moon mission and colony in his
‘Most Promising Works on the Development of Outer Space.’,The USSR led the way in lunar exploration with the
first probe to impact the Moon
(Luna 2, September 1959), the
first flyby and image of the far side of the Moon
(Luna 3, October 1959) , the
first soft landing
(Luna 9, February 1966), the
first lunar orbiter
(Luna 10, March 1966) and the first spacecraft to circle the Moon and return to Earth
carrying tortoises, flies, mealworms, plants, seeds and bacteria
(Zond 5, September 1968).,It’s important to note that, in 1964, the Soviet government gave the authorisation—undeclared to the world—to proceed with a Moon mission.,Science Museum space curator Doug Millard comments: ‘Kennedy set the US on a course for the Moon in 1961. The Soviet Union waited until 1964 – three years too late?’,,Soon after, Leonov began to train for this mission along with
Oleg Grigoryevich Makarov (1933-2003)
.,To prepare for this complex lunar landing, Leonov learned how to cope with high g forces, made regular parachute drops from a helicopter and, since they did not have a Lunar Landing Training Vehicle, would take over the controls of a helicopter during rapid descent from altitudes as little as 100m, or land the helicopter with the engine turned off, when the main rotor turns by autorotation. Despite this, the risks were never far from his mind.,On 27 March 1968, Leonov heard two distant explosions while training a group of cosmonauts in lunar landing techniques. Later that day it emerged that
Gagarin had crashed during a training flight in a MiG-15.,,The USSR planned for Leonov to land on the Moon in a craft known as the LK (Russian: Лунный корабль, “Lunniy korabl”, meaning “lunar craft”).,An earlier unmanned probe, the Lunokhod rover, would be used to select a landing spot, and then act as a beacon for a backup LK to be sent to the site. The third step would see a manned LK landing with a single cosmonaut. The Lunokhod would also provide the means to reach the backup LK, if needed.,Like America’s Apollo programme, the Soviets wanted to use a giant rocket for Its lunar mission, and their N1 was similar in height to the American Saturn V rocket. But the N1 project was rushed and the engines never fully tested before the first launch attempt in February 1969. All four launch attempts ended in failure – the first N1 rocket lasted a minute, the second collapsed onto the launch pad, the third disintegrated and the fourth exploded.,,The next step was, of course, to plant a flag.,,On July 21, 1969, the world was glued to its television screens as
Neil Armstrong
and then
Buzz Aldrin
set foot on the Moon in the Apollo 11 mission.,Leonov went to a research center in Moscow to watch his American rivals. The
Russian Luna 15
mission, designed to return soil samples from the lunar surface, underwent its mission at the same time as Apollo 11, and the need to coordinate these missions marked a rare example of cooperation between the world’s space superpowers.,Doug Millard, Space Curator, commented that Chris Kraft, Apollo mission planner, was uneasy about the Soviets’ Luna 15 being present during the Apollo 11 landing.,,When Neil Armstrong set his left boot on the lunar surface on July 21, 1969, he spoke the now-famous words, “That’s one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.”,Leonov also thought hard about his own first moments on the Moon’s surface.,,Overall, one could sense Leonov’s frustration with the limits of the USSR’s Moon ambitions.,The Zond 5 mission of September 1968, which carried tortoises and other Earthlings, also contained a mannequin cast in the image of Yuri Gagarin, studded with radiation detectors, for the trip around the Moon and back to Earth.,Downcast, Leonov
told the audience at a Science Museum IMAX event
how the USSR programme could have taken one more step towards the Moon as ‘six spacecraft orbited the Moon without a man on board.’,Roger Highfield interviewed Alexei Leonov when the museum opened its
Cosmonauts
exhibition in 2015."

Thalassemias are hereditary conditions, meaning that some people carry what is known as a trait. Carriers do not usually experience any symptoms, however if two parents both carry a trait, their children are more at risk of inheriting Thalassemia major – the most severe form of the condition.,History of Thalassemia,Cooley’s anaemia”, as it was first known, was named after Dr Thomas Benton Cooley, an American paediatrician who was researching childhood anaemia when he noticed similar conditions in children of Italian and Greek descent. This form of Thalassemia is now known as beta thalassemia major.,Thalassemia comes from the Greek
thalassa
meaning “of the sea” and was chosen as an overarching term as the condition was noted to be predominant in people whose ancestral homes surrounded the Mediterranean Sea.,Although the condition occurs across the world, it predominantly affects people of Mediterranean, North African, Middle Eastern and Asian origin – similar to the way Sickle Cell Anaemia predominantly affects people of African origin. These genetic quirks, sometimes interpreted as clever adaptations to better cope with other environmental or medical conditions, have meant that strictly medical approaches to research and treatment have sometimes been complicated by cultural and societal issues.,Genetic superpower?,One theory that has developed to explain the high prevalence of thalassemias in people with Southern European, Middle Eastern and South Asian descent is that (once again similarly to sickle-cell) the mutation that causes thalassemia is thought to offer a degree of protection against malaria. This adaptation could account for the ability of people to survive in historically malaria-ridden environments, where others would not be able to cope. This genetic superpower of sorts has been extensively studied,
picked up positively in the press
, and the idea of beneficial mutation as a “superpower” has even been adopted by some patients as a creative way of interpreting their condition and challenging assumptions about their abilities.,Combatting prejudice,In the United Kingdom, both Thalassemia and Sickle-Cell disease have historically been talked about together in
public health messaging
and
government campaigns
. The
Sickle-Cell Society
was founded in 1979 to tackle inequalities in health care for people living with sickle cell disorders. Similarly, the
UK Thalassemia Society
promotes better research and public health initiatives to educate high-risk communities and the wider public about Thalassemia. Their aim is to raise awareness and engagement with specific inequalities and issues faced by those living with the condition and their families.,Both these activist groups have had close ties and worked together, partly due to the similarities between Sickle Cell and Thalassemia, but also due to the specific challenges of cutting through prejudice that exists even in a discipline that should not discriminate. In 2013, following the death of Sickle-Cell patient Sarah Mulenga, chief executive of the Sickle-Cell Society John James
spoke out about pervasive stereotypes
, lack of public education and how they combine to leave medical professionals ill-equipped to treat patients who are in crisis. The
Nursing Times
has also cited the lack of specialists in the field as a worrying example of how
prejudice and racism infect patient’s experiences
.,But it’s not just cutting through established inequalities that poses a challenge for campaign groups; attempts at community engagement are sometimes marred by mistrust and the difficulty of communicating across language, cultural and religious barriers.,A survey in 1995 found that although 1 in 7 people of South Asian ancestry were likely to carry the Thalassemia trait, only 4% of South Asians living in England had been tested to confirm their carrier status. This shocking lack of awareness, in part due to public health messaging about the condition being neglected at a national level, led to the creation of publications specifically aimed at the British-Asian community that drew on community networks and narratives to get the message across.,The NHS has also taken on board the urgency of building trust with marginalised communities, with specific campaigns designed to
encourage BAME communities to donate blood
.,In the Science Museum’s new
Medicine Galleries
, a display features a molecular model of a red blood cell showing abnormalities associated with Sickle Cell.
As awareness of the conditions improves and communities at higher risk of being affected speak out about their experiences, we hope it will be an opportunity to engage with the wider public about these rare conditions and the lived experiences of those living with them."

","At the Museum,Collections and Objects","history of medicine,medical collection,medicine galleries,women in science","Our kidneys are remarkable. They quietly work away in our bodies, filtering waste products into urine, maintaining our blood pressure and producing a substance to stimulate our red blood cells.,Perhaps unsurprisingly, kidneys feature in the Science Museum Group Collection from the ubiquitous
kidney-shaped bowl
(shaped to fit against the body or to hold instruments) to some more surprising objects.,In 2019, there were
2424 kidney transplants
in the UK. On display in
Medicine: The Wellcome Galleries
are the
3D printed MRI scans
used to plan a transplant operation
between a father, Chris, and his then 2-year old daughter, Lucy. You can also hear from the family in a special film, on display next to the models.,Shortages of organs have also led medical and scientific researchers to look at different approaches.,Floating within a sealed jar, these two pig kidneys have been genetically modified in the hope that they could be used in humans. Known as xenotransplantation, this process has been a great hope for the future but there are problems of organ rejection that have been too large to overcome. There are also some unknowns as to how diseases may cross the species barrier.,For those awaiting a kidney transplant or with chronic kidney conditions,
dialysis
mimics the functions of the kidneys.,Some of the very first experiments with dialysis machines were made from items researchers had to hand, including one
made from an apricot tin
.,During the Second World War,
Willelm J Kolff
created a machine out of cellophane sausage skin, a car pump and a revolving drum. It was unsuccessful until he treated a woman who had acute kidney failure in 1945.,In 1950, Kolff emigrated to the United States, where the development of artificial organs still dominated his career. At Brigham and Women’s Hospital, he continued to develop his machine resulting in one similar to
the one on display
in our
Making the Modern World
gallery
.,Kidney dialysis machines also crossed into the home. In
Medicine: The Wellcome Galleries
you can hear
Maureen Lewis’ experience
of owning and using a machine at home. Nicknamed ‘Doctor Who’, Maureen had dialysis while she slept, trusting the constant whirring of
the machine
to do its job.,Kidneys were also the focus for researchers such as x-ray crystallographer,
Kathleen Lonsdale
.,,Collecting a huge variety of kidney and gall stones, Lonsdale examined the crystal structures using x-rays.,She became interested in stones after finding out that children, in particular countries such as Turkey, had a higher chance of getting a stone. With her colleagues, she hoped to find the causes of these stones to help find ways of preventing them. She published an article called
‘Human Stones’ in
Science
in March 1968
and went on to complete the first draft of a book of the same name in the weeks leading up to her death in 1971.,Her conclusion was that by making models of the crystals that formed the stones, you can examine why different ages and genders develop different forms of stone.,You can see some of these models and stones on display in our
Medicine galleries.,So on
World Kidney Day
, take a moment to think of the small organs working away and to the innovative research and developments that have come from the times when they don’t always work as predicted."

, each with its own story to tell, we’ve selected just four of those people whose work has shaped our ongoing fascination of our nearest star.,Griffith Pugh was part of the first successful team to summit Everest in 1953. He used
this radiometer
to measure ultraviolet light, which has now been donated to the Science Museum by his son Simon.,During the expedition he wore pyjamas, a hat and sunglasses to protect himself from the Sun. The pyjamas served the purpose of being lightweight, covering and stylish – ideal for both trekking in intense ultraviolet and for a reception held by the King of Nepal.,A World Championship skier who was selected to represent Britain in the 1936 Winter Olympics, Pugh was of a fundamentally curious and adventurous nature. He once experimented with the effects of hypothermia by attaching electrodes to his body and submerging himself in an ice bath; from which he had to be rescued by his technician due to paralysis. He was dedicated to exploring how the human body functioned in extreme environments and his scientific findings are invaluable.,Elizabeth Beckley was one of the first female employees of an astronomical observatory and a
pioneer of her time
. Despite her name not appearing on any of Kew Observatory’s annual salary lists, she was occasionally paid £5.,In the 1860s she worked to
photograph and analyse the Sun
. Her results were used to predict solar winds and to understand the inter-relation between sunspots and magnetic cycles.,Beckley married George Matthew Whipple who also worked at the Kew Observatory. Their son, Robert, became the founding donor of the
Whipple Museum of the History of Science
in Cambridge.,Born in France,
Étienne Trouvelot
, emigrated with his family to the USA following the rise of Napolean Bonaparte in 1851. During his lifetime he produced over 7,000 astronomical illustrations, some of which were featured in the
The Sun: Living With Our Star
. They also appear on the wall in Star Trek episode,
The Menagerie
. Before photography became widely used, artistic skill was essential for making scientific observations and Trouvelot was invited to join the staff of the Harvard College Observatory.,He is also
notorious
for accidentally introducing the gypsy moth into North America. Apparently, he was raising the imported larvae in his home when some escaped. The first gypsy moth outbreak on his street occurred in 1882 – the year Trouvelot returned to live in France. The situation worsened, and residents became alarmed. Sadly, the gypsy moth is very difficult to eradicate and is now one of several foliage feeding insects that cause

Almagest

Earth at the centre
and the Sun moving around us in a circle. His theory remained the accepted model for over 1400 years.,Today we know that Ptolemy was wrong in his belief of an Earth centred universe.

.,English Heritage
curator Heather Sebire explains the significance of the winter solstice and the role of the Sun in this important event.,Many people will gather at Stonehenge on Saturday morning to celebrate the
winter solstice
. Stonehenge the great prehistoric stone circle set in a complex prehistoric landscape in central Wiltshire is built on a solstitial alignment. Within the circles of stones, the great sarsen outer circle with its lintels joining the uprights together and the smaller bluestones forming an inner circle, stands a majestic horseshoe of huge trilithons. Trilithon literally mean ‘three stones’, from the Greek, and consists of the iconic two uprights or orthostats held together by a single lintel which form the centre of the temple.,At Stonehenge, the solstice alignment means that at the time of the summer solstice in June when the sun is over the Tropic of Capricorn, it rises and shines through the centre of the stone circle. Many people think that the sun rises above the Heelstone just outside the circle but in fact it rises along the axis of the sarsen monument to its left. We know from archaeological excavations that the Heelstone was one of a pair, one standing on either side of the axis and there were other stones in front of the circle either side of this alignment which would have given the impression that the sun was following a corridor between the stones.,This is repeated at the winter Solstice when the sunset is visible through the centre of the stone circle when you stand with your back to the entrance and with the Avenue dropping away behind you.,The summer solstice is seen as a time of mid-summer celebration and probably was celebrated as such in ancient times. It attracts many thousands of people in modern times, who come to Stonehenge to celebrate the longest day of the year. However it is more likely that the builders of Stonehenge regarded the mid-winter sunset as more important. These were the first people who were farming, rearing domestic animals and growing crops for food. They would have known that the midwinter sunset marked the turning of the year and so the days would get longer and the weather would improve and spring would come round again.,Many people come to Stonehenge to celebrate the mid-winter sunset as part of the run up to Christmas and the holiday season. However, it is the Druid and pagan communities who particularly celebrate the return of the sun in the sky from it furthest point in the southern hemisphere. There are several days when the sun seems to stand still and it rises and sets at the same time. It then starts to move back to the northern hemisphere. They celebrate the return and ‘rebirth’ of the sun and all the awe and mystery it brings.,Stonehenge is not the only megalithic monument where the mid-winter sunset is revered. The great prehistoric tomb at New Grange in Ireland is orientated on the mid-winter solstice as is the great cairn at Maes Howe in Orkney.,Discover more in

And can cinema still be a transcendental experience? Paul Franklin, director and Academy-Award winning visual effects designer (
Inception
,
Interstellar
) talks about his fascination for Kubrick’s sci-fi classic and highlights the joys of watching an ‘unrestored’ print.,Stanley Kubrick’s
2001: A Space Odyssey
has long been held as a gold standard for cinematic image quality, filmed using the high-resolution Super Panavision 70 system and exhibiting all of the hallmarks of Kubrick’s meticulous working process. I first saw 2001 when I was about ten years old, and it was a key experience that helped to set me on the path to becoming a film visual effects designer.,However, like many who grew up in the 70s and 80s Kubrick’s original 70mm vision wasn’t available to me – during that period only those lucky enough to live in big cities with a surfeit of cinemas had that privilege – instead I saw it on television, broadcast by the BBC in blurry 625 line PAL on my parents’ 25 inch colour TV (roughly 1/4 the resolution of a modern HD TV) which gave an “impressionistic” rendering of the film, to say the least.,Over the years the presentation of the film gradually improved – VHS, DVD, Blu-ray, various restorations – and now, after 50 years, we’re finally back to something close to the way it looked in April 1968 when the film was first released. But why get excited about a photochemical print of a half-century old film? Surely the advances in digital projection have far surpassed anything that Kubrick could have achieved in the 1960s.,Well, it is true that many old films have benefited from digital restoration, cleaning off the dirt and scratches that have built up over the years and bringing back some of the vivid clarity of their original colours, but the fact remains that even the sharpest 4K digital projection only captures about 25% of the resolution of the original 70mm print and, regardless of what the sales people in the TV show room may tell you, there are some colours that just don’t translate from film to digital.
2001: A Space Odyssey
, Unrestored has the scratches and glitches of a hand-crafted artefact, but it has so much more that all digital “approximations” of the film have lost over the years.,2001: A Space Odyssey
is where the modern science fiction aesthetic – so successfully adopted by Star Wars a decade later – really begins. Kubrick rejected cinema’s previous fantasy-based efforts to represent space travel, turning instead to NASA and the rapidly developing world of high-tech industry to create a compelling future that is as much concerned about the small details, such as the Pan Am logo on the tail of the shuttle, as it is about the grand scale of the solar system and the machines that transport our heroes across it.,Rather like the Apollo Moon missions themselves,
2001
seemingly fell out of the future, fully formed, into the late 1960s. Cinema audiences had never seen anything like it before and not all the initial reactions were good with many people famously walking out of the film’s premiere during the interval.,But great art – and
2001
is
great art, not just another movie – often gets a bumpy ride at the beginning and can sometimes take many years to be accepted for what it actually is. And art, or rather the art world, is where Kubrick found his inspiration for one of the other key components of the film; the representation of the alien and the infinite, embodied in the inscrutable black monolith with its obvious debt to 20th century art such as Kazimir Malevich’s “Black Square” painting of 1915.,Kubrick relentlessly pushed at the limits of every aspect of his film which in turn inspired his collaborators to astonishing heights – for my money, the dazzlingly abstract “Stargate” sequence, created by legendary effects artist
Douglas Trumbull
, is the greatest ever piece of visual effects filmmaking which I don’t think will be surpassed (and believe me, I have tried!),A good 70mm photochemical presentation of
2001
on a really big screen is a revelation and, fortunately for us, the IMAX Theatre at the Science Museum in London has one of the biggest screens anywhere. Some things have dated – women and the rest of the world don’t get much to do in Kubrick’s anglo-centric future – but even for people who have seen the film many times in other formats there is so much to discover and experience for the first time – the film becomes immersive, hypnotic and, ultimately, transcendental.,The death of “traditional” cinema, where people sit in the dark and share an experience of light and sound together, has been predicted many times over the years, but for me the continuing fascination with
2001: A Space Odyssey
indicates that this is premature and if you want proof then go and see it at the Science Museum while you can.,Watch the trailer for Paul Franklin’s new short film,

Beyond the reach of its warming rays the universe is vast, dark and freezing. Despite all humankind’s technological and scientific achievements, we could not survive without the Sun, and there is no better reminder of that fact than the extraordinary summer of 1816.,I had a dream, which was not all a dream.,The bright sun was extinguish’d, and the stars,Did wander darkling in the eternal space,,Rayless, and pathless, and the icy earth,Swung blind and blackening in the moonless air;,Morn came and went—and came, and brought no day,,And men forgot their passions in the dread,Of this their desolation,– Darkness, by Lord Byron,Byron was inspired to write this apocalyptic poem while staying by the banks of Lake Geneva in July 1816. That year, Europe and North America were in the grip of one of the coldest summers on record. A strange darkness covered the land, thunder rumbled in the mountains and torrential rain swelled the lake.,Forced to abandon their plans in the countryside, Byron and his guests – including Mary Shelley – retreated indoors at the Villa Diodati and amused themselves by writing ghost stories by candlelight. Mary Shelley was also inspired by these dramatic lightning storms, and it was in this atmosphere that she went on to pen
Frankenstein
.,In
Darkness
, Byron imagined the grim fate of humanity after the sudden death of the Sun, but this was more than just apocalyptic fantasy. The bad weather had devastated crops across Europe, leading to famines, typhus outbreaks and rioting. In North America, snow storms swept across New England in June, while woodland birds were driven into New York City, where they fell dead in the streets.,Meanwhile, a strange haze dimmed the Sun and monstrous sunspots spread across its surface like ‘black bile’. The spots were so large that they could even be seen without a telescope, just by looking through a piece of coloured glass. As people searched for an explanation for these frightening events, an astronomer in Bologna blamed the sunspots and said they signalled the imminent death of the Sun. According to his prediction, the Sun would go out on the 18
th
July 1816.,Rumours of this spread through Europe and England, stirring further hysteria among populations already pushed to their limits by famine, disease and civil strife.,While several newspapers attempted to calm public fears of the imminent end of the world, others explicitly described the connection between sunspots and weather patterns. An article in the
Perth Courier
stated:,It is in an undoubted fact that, during the whole season, the weather has been uniformly coldest, at least in this country, when the largest spots were turned towards the earth; and, indeed, if it be admitted that the Sun is the principal source of heat to the planets which revolve around him, that whatever affects the splendour of his atmosphere… must affect, in a corresponding degree, the temperature of these bodies.,The idea that sunspots could influence the climate had recently been advanced by the astronomer and discoverer of Uranus, William Herschel. In 1801, Herschel had presented a study to the Royal Society that compared grain prices from Adam Smith’s
The Wealth of Nations
to his own 40-year record of sunspot activity. He concluded that there was a probable link between the number of sunspots and the harvests. Though ridiculed by some of his peers, Herschel’s ideas remained popular for much of the 19
th
century and may have influenced the response to the events of 1816.,As doomsday approached, the panic reached fever-pitch with riots breaking out across Europe. In Austria, troops were drafted in to control anxious crowds, while newspapers speculated that the ‘prophecy’ of the death of the Sun had been spread to provoke revolution.,In France, the government was so concerned by the public mood that they produced pamphlets explaining that the sunspots were harmless. According to reports, one maidservant became so distressed at the prospect of the end of the world that she committed suicide.,In the end, the 18
th
July came and went, and the Sun continued to shine.,Nevertheless, the anxious mood persisted and the following months proved to be extremely challenging for the people of Europe and North America. The corn crop failed in the Eastern United States, driving subsistence farmers to seek better conditions further to the west. In Ireland, the famine triggered a typhus outbreak, which soon spread to the rest of the British Isles and killed over 65,000 people.,So, if the Sun wasn’t to blame for the terrible summer of 1816, what was?,It turns out the cold summer was actually the delayed result of the eruption of Mount Tambora in the Dutch East Indies. Between the 5
th
and 12
th
April 1815, the most powerful volcanic eruption in recorded history shattered the island of Sumbawa. As Tambora erupted, rock, ash and dust were blasted into the atmosphere, raining death and destruction across hundreds of miles. Of the 12,000 inhabitants of the island, a mere 26 survived.,Over the following year, the dust and volcanic gas spread across the globe, dimming the Sun and causing temperatures to drop in some regions by several degrees. An aerosol of volcanic particles produced strange yellow hazes and lurid sunsets.,Some think these lighting conditions are reflected in the paintings of William Turner, particularly
Chichester Canal
(though they could also be the result of the eye-damage that Turner suffered from staring directly at the Sun; a practice thought to help relax the eyes).,This remarkable episode highlights just how dependent we are on the Sun. Tambora’s eruption led to a relatively tiny reduction in the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth’s surface, and yet the impact in Europe and North America was dramatic. Byron’s poetry may paint a fantastical picture but in 1816 the prospect of a world without the Sun seemed terrifyingly real.,Learn more about humanity’s relationship with our nearest star in

On crystal structure, an authority.
Into crystals she did delve,
solving vitamin B12,
before insulin became her priority.,This doggerel is the result of two coinciding anniversaries: National Limerick Day (of course), celebrating the birth of poet Edward Lear in 1812 and – 98 years on – the birth of celebrated crystallographer Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin.,Dorothy Crowfoot’s early interest in chemistry was encouraged from a young age. While at school she set up a small laboratory in her attic, acquiring chemicals from her local pharmacist, and studying the texts of William Henry Bragg’s
Royal Institution Christmas Lectures
from 1923 and 1925.,William Bragg
and his son
(William) Lawrence
had already established the foundations of x-ray crystallography in 1912, a technique that involved bombarding crystals with x-rays to reveal their molecular structure. Crowfoot would specialise in crystallography during her undergraduate degree in chemistry at Oxford.,Although science was generally male-dominated at the time, crystallography was an area particularly open to women. This was partly owing to the practice established by William Bragg – among his 18 research students, 11 were women.,Crowfoot would study crystallography at Cambridge under one of Bragg’s students, the somewhat infamous Marxist
John Desmond Bernal
. Bernal became Crowfoot’s scientific and political mentor, as well as love interest until she married in 1937
Thomas Lionel Hodgkin
, a civil servant in Palestine and later historian of Africa.,On
VE day
in 1945 Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin completed the first in a series of major scientific accomplishments: the confirmation of the structure of penicillin, the hugely useful mould for fighting bacterial infection. Bowing to social pressure, she gave her married name, Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin, to her big publication on penicillin in 1949.,The next molecule she tackled was vitamin B12, a hugely complex structure of 100 atoms. When Crowfoot Hodgkin’s Oxford team solved it in 1957, Lawrence Bragg described her achievement as the equivalent of ‘breaking the sound barrier’.,Accolades poured in. The Royal Society awarded Crowfoot Hodgkin the Royal Medal in 1957. She then won the
1964 Nobel Prize in Chemistry
and remains the only British woman to win a science Nobel. In 1965 she was presented with the
Order of Merit
, the second ever female recipient after Florence Nightingale 58 years earlier.,But Crowfoot Hodgkin’s crowning achievement in science was yet to come… After over three decades of painstaking analysis, she determined the three-dimensional structure of insulin, the hormone that helps the body absorb glucose. She would travel the world giving talks on its importance for diabetes.,Her achievements are all the more remarkable given she carried out such delicate and precise work with her hands having suffered from acute arthritis since 1938. The artist Henry Moore was so inspired that he made her hands the subject of a series of
lithograph drawings
in 1978.,A key part of Crowfoot Hodgkin’s work was visualising molecules. Her insulin diagrams even became the inspiration for a series of designs for the Festival of Britain, from dress fabric to wallpaper.,Crowfoot Hodgkin was also a political campaigner, involved in the
Communist Party of Great Britain
, the
Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament
and the
British Society for Social Responsibility in Science
.,Fittingly for National Limerick Day, Crowfoot Hodgkin had a keen interest in poetry. She was required to memorise swathes of Tennyson and Browning. Kipling would be her poetry of choice when reading to her children, such as one of the most famous poems in popular culture, ‘If’, as recited
here
by Harvey Keitel to Elgar in a vintage bank advert.,We’d love to hear your scientific limericks in the comments below!"
https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/perfecting-porcelain/,Sophie Waring,Perfecting Porcelain,250 years ago William Cookworthy was awarded a patent for producing an English true hard-paste porcelain similar to that being produced in China and Germany. Curator of Chemistry Sophie Waring explores more.,Collections and Objects,"chemistry,materials","When fine porcelain bowls and teacups from the eighteenth-century are displayed and preserved in the collections of museums and country homes, they speak to us of many things: art and design, society and empire, perhaps even our own tea-drinking habits.,Chemistry is probably not high on the list of things that come to mind when looking at porcelain and china, but this teacup is very much at home in the Science Museum Collection as an object that tells us as much about scientific innovation as it does about the imperialist tea-trade or the tastes and values of eighteenth-century society.,Between 1712 and 1720 many of the manufacturing secrets of Chinese porcelain were revealed to European audiences for the first time through the writings of the French Jesuit father
Francois Xavier d’Entrecolles
who lived in Jingdezhen, the centre of porcelain production in China for over a millennium. While this information flowed from the east, the Germans
Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus
and
Johann Friedrich Böttger
had independently discovered the secret of hard-paste porcelain manufacture in 1710, establishing the
Meissen Porcelain Manufactory
near Dresden.,English manufacturers were behind. The first soft-paste in England was only demonstrated in 1742 by the chemist Thomas Briand to the Royal Society. In contrast to the hard-paste porcelain fired at high temperatures which was being manufactured in Germany and imported from China, Briand’s soft-paste porcelain did not easily retain its shape in its wet state, and slumped in the kiln under high temperatures. This also meant the glaze could be easily scratched. Nevertheless there was a rush of porcelain manufacturing following Briand’s method; the
Chelsea Porcelain Factory
and the
Bow Porcelain Factory
in London, where the first factories were founded, started traditions in this period that still define their signature designs today, such as
Wedgewood
and
Spode
.,One of these early factories was different. Plymouth Porcelain, established in 1769 used kaolin and ‘china stone’ to make hard-paste porcelain similar to Chinese porcelain imports of the early 18th century. This factory was established by the chemist and Quaker minister William Cookworthy.,Cookworthy began an apprenticeship with the Quaker apothecaries Timothy and Sylvanus Bevan in Plough Court, London. Cookworthy, coming from a poor part of rural Devon, walked to London, saving the coach fare, to start work at age 15. Quickly recognising his outstanding intelligence and practical skill, the Bevan brothers took Cookworthy into their partnership at the end of his apprenticeship in 1726 and formed ‘Bevans and Cookworthy’, a wholesale chemist and druggist in Plymouth, servicing the west-country doctors and the navy at the port.,After the death of his wife Sarah a decade later, Cookworthy retreated entirely from public life leaving his brother to manage his business. He devoted his energies to walking, religious work and began experimental work with clay.,Cookworthy quickly realised that two key ingredients of Chinese porcelain – kaolin for the body and petuntse for the glaze – were to be found in the china clay and moorstone (called locally: growan) in the Cornish moors.,By 1758 he was successfully firing hard-paste porcelain, but the discovery of abundant deposits of high-quality china clay and moorstone on the estate of
Thomas Pitt
, later Lord Camelford, allowed Cookworthy to think of factory scale production. Pitt financed Cookworthy’s continuing experimental work and in 1768 helped him obtain a patent, to protect his method in a competitive market.,In the same year, Cookworthy opened a porcelain factory in Plymouth. This quickly cemented Cookworthy’s position as a significant member of intellectual society, with
John Smeaton
choosing to lodge with him during the building of the
Eddystone Lighthouse,
and
Captain James Cook
,
Joseph Banks
and
Daniel Solander
all dining with him
before sailing from Plymouth
in 1768.,The business moved to 15 Caste Green, Bristol, where porcelain was manufactured under Cookworthy’s supervision until his retirement in 1773. His partner Richard Champion bought Cookworthy’s half of the business and the rights to his patent, but only continued production until 1778. Champion sold the method and the factory to a syndicate of Staffordshire Potters who used Cornish clay to make bone-china. The true porcelain manufacturing method, invented and pioneered by Cookworthy, virtually ceased in Britain after the closure of the Bristol factory.,Bristol porcelain is displayed by many art and design collections in the UK, appreciated for its elegance, but with this teacup held by the Science Museum we can remember the link between the art and science of innovation in the Georgian period; materials and design affecting each other, with hard-paste porcelain allowing Cookworthy to produce items rivalling those from Jingdezhen, something his British counterparts could only try to imitate 250 years ago."
https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/how-digital-imaging-sensors-have-shaped-our-world/,Sarah  Gaunt,How digital imaging sensors have shaped our world,Sarah Gaunt celebrates innovations that have revolutionised the way we see and capture the world around us.,At the Museum,"engineering,photography,QE Prize,space","The winners of the world’s most prestigious engineering award, the
Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering
, were joined this week by more than a hundred budding engineers at the Science Museum. Just the day before, they had been presented the 2017 QEPrize by HRH The Prince of Wales, in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace.,Michael Tompsett, Eric Fossum and Nobukazu Teranishi are celebrated for revolutionising the way we see and
capture the world around us
. Together with the work of George Smith, their inventions have led to the digital imaging sensors that we use every day in cameras and smartphones around the world.,They have allowed us to explore the human body right down to individual cells and have brought us images from the very furthest reaches of space. And of course, they have made the ‘selfie’ possible.,The story began more than three decades ago, without a photograph in sight.,New Jersey in the swinging sixties was a hotbed of engineering innovation, and
George Smith
was on the hunt for new ways to improve computer memory.,A distant ancestor of the storage devices we use today, his solution was the ‘charge coupled device’, or CCD. The device moves electrical charges across a
silicon chip
, before storing the pulses of electricity as digital data – a series of ones and zeros.,Michael Tompsett
, who was working in the same lab, immediately saw the potential of George’s invention for imaging, developing the first CCD image sensor.,Each sensor is made up of light-sensitive cells, called pixels. When light hit this sensor, they cause pixels to release a burst of electricity. The charge coupled device then picks up these electrical signals and transfers them across the surface, before turning them from volts into ‘bits’ and storing the captured image as electronic data.,The pinned photodiode, or PPD, is the second invention honoured by this year’s QEPrize. In the 1980s,
Nobukazu Teranishi
was working for the NEC corporation in Japan, experimenting with semiconductors. The semiconductor that led to his invention is the diode, a device that forces electrical current to flow in one direction only- rather like a one-way valve. A photodiode does this when it is exposed to light, and is made of a semiconducting material like silicon.,Nobu’s pinned photodiode for CCD image sensors is far more efficient than regular photodiodes. It reduces the ‘noise’ and grainy effects in darker photographs and gives crisper, sharper images.,Its improved quality meant that the size of light-sensing pixels in CCD sensors could be reduced, and more pixels could be packed into the same area. With more pixels capturing more information, Nobu’s PPD allowed
cameras
to take much higher resolution, better quality images.,The final piece of the imaging puzzle was dropped into place by
Eric Fossum
and his colleagues at NASA. The 90s at NASA were characterised by then administrator Daniel Goldin’s, ‘faster, better, cheaper’ approach to spacecraft design. Mike and Nobu’s technology was already being used in space, however, the high- energy cosmic particles in space often damaged the delicate image sensors.,In a bid to improve their design, Eric brought together several earlier concepts, shrinking them into a new device. The Complimentary Metal Oxide Semiconductor, or CMOS sensors, can now be made much smaller and consume around 100 times less power than CCD imagers.,This means that not only do they reduce the weight of payloads being launched into space, cutting fuel costs, but they drain less power from the spacecraft and even need less protection from cosmic radiation.,Back on Earth, CMOS sensors are much cheaper to produce than CCDs and have a much longer battery life, making them perfect for commercial cameras. In recent years, their low cost and easy availability means that cameras are a feature of almost all
mobile phones
, and many of us will have a digital camera at home as well.,Every second of the day, every day of the year, around 50 cameras are made with CMOS sensors.,At a special event this week in the Science Museum, the 2017 QEPrize winners addressed school students from across London. Hosted by
LJ Rich
, a musician, inventor and presenter of BBC Click, the panel was completed by ‘Rocket Woman’
Vinita Marwaha Madill
and biomedical imaging expert,
Professor Alison Noble
.,Alongside telling the story of imaging sensors, the panel explored the limitless applications that are helping to transform our world. From the tiny pill cameras that let us peek inside the human body and ‘augmented reality’ operating theatres, to weather stations in space and Google Maps aboard the ISS, digital imaging sensors have impacted every aspect of our lives on, and off, our planet.,Following the discussion, students had the chance to quiz the world’s leading engineers themselves, exchanging views on everything from discovering the selfie to preventing the rise of sentient robots!,To find out more about the QEPrize winners and their innovations, head over to the

",Collections and Objects,"art,communication,photography","2017 is a special year for the UK as it marks the 400th anniversary of the grant of British patent number one. From radio and radar to MRI and fibre optics, do you know just how many of the world’s revolutionary innovations were developed and patented in Britain?,It all started in 1852 (yes, we know that’s not 400 years ago, bear with us!) when the
Patent Law Amendment Act
created The Patent Office. When the commissioners were appointed to administer the act in 1852, they set out to address a longstanding grievance by printing and publishing the records of English patents for inventions granted before the year 1852. To do this they referred to a series of docquet books going back to 1617 which listed all of the grants that had been made under the Great Seal. They arranged the entries in chronological order starting with the earliest patent register, known as GB1, which was granted on 2 March 1617 to Rapburne and Burges of London and related to the production of a map of the city of London.*,This archive represents one of the world’s oldest and most widely respected systems of Intellectual Property. It is also a treasure trove of imagination, which is exactly what the
IPO
,
British Library
and
GREAT Britain campaign
have set out to explore in a commemorative project which shines a light on some of the standout patents from the last 400 years through a series of original images. The imagery has been produced by a creative collective led by still life photographer
Ted Humble-Smith
comprising British sculptors, set designers, artists and engineers.,All of the patents featured can be seen by following @GREATforImagination on Instagram or searching
#GREATforImagination
.,*Note: Historians highlight that the commissioners’ failure to take into account Britain’s transition from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar in 1752 means that some of the dates on the register are not accurate if using modern dating methods. If you were to account for this transition, the first chronological patent would actually be GB2, issued to Nicholas Hillyard on 1
st
May 1617. The patent granted Hillyard, an artist who specialised in sculpting miniatures, the sole licence to produce engraved royal portraits for a period of twelve years. But whether you consider GB1 or GB2 to be the original register, 2017 marks the 400
th
anniversary of the granting of the first numbered patents.,Kinemacolor, The World’s First Successful Colour Film Process GB190626671
George Albert Smith was born in London on 4 January 1864. After witnessing a film demonstration by the Lumiere brothers in 1896, Smith purchased a camera and began making short films in and around St Ann’s Well Garden in Brighton. Through his work he came into contact with the American financier, Charles Urban, and by the early 1900s he and Urban were building on the ideas of Edward Turner with the aim of producing the first successful colour process.,Whereas Turner had focused on three colours, Smith realized that only two colours (red and green) were required to make a satisfactory colour image and he patented his technique,
Kinemacolor
, in 1906. In May 1908 Smith and Urban unveiled Kinemacolor to a stunned audience at the Urbanora House on Wardour Street. This was the beginning of a production boom for the area and by 1914 Wardour Street was home to more than 20 film companies.,Today, Britain’s film industry is booming and film production spend reached £1.6bn in 2016. More information on the
history of film and photography
can be found at the
National Science and Media Museum
in Bradford.,The Electric Telegraph GB183707390
In 1837 Charles Wheatstone and William Cooke demonstrated
the world’s first electric telegraph system
to the directors of the newly-opened London and Birmingham Railway. Messages were relayed from one device to the other by using electromagnetism to rotate needles in the direction of the correct letter. The instrument was known simply therefore as the
‘Five Needle Telegraph’
and marks the origin of one of the UK’s largest communications companies today: BT.,This was a significant invention and from the 1840s onwards the electric telegraph transformed world communications. After a
transatlantic telegraph cable
was laid in 1866, messages between Europe and North America took only hours to arrive rather than weeks. The electric telegraph also enabled Greenwich time to be distributed right across Britain, and within a few years local time, based on the times of sunrise and sunset, had been replaced by standard (Greenwich) time.,You can see the Cooke and Wheatstone electric telegraph dial in the Science Museum’s
Information Age gallery
.,Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) GB1596160
Sir Peter Mansfield led a team at the University of Nottingham in the 1970s that developed
Magnetic Resonance Imaging
, one of the most important breakthroughs in modern medicine. The technique uses a powerful magnet to align water molecules in the body, producing detailed 3D images without the use of damaging radiation. Sir Peter shared the
2003 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine
with the American chemist and inventor of the technique Paul Lauterbur.,Sir Peter’s personal story is also interesting – the son of a gas fitter, he left school at the age of 15, working as a printer’s assistant until he managed to secure a job at the government’s rocket propulsion department in Westcott, Buckinghamshire. After a degree in physics at Queen Mary College, University of London, he joined the University of Nottingham as a physics lecturer in 1964 and remained there for 30 years. He sadly passed away this year."

His image was recreated in its hundreds of thousands – from postage stamps, posters and desk-top souvenirs to the statues and friezes scattered throughout Russia and the former USSR.,The London statue can now be seen at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich but from today a new bust of the first cosmonaut will be displayed at the Science Museum.

technology has driven the rise of fake news
, for example. But in a BBC webcast of a conversation in the museum with Professor Brian Cox, Royal Society Professor for Public Engagement in Science, Schmidt said he was ‘strongly in favour of free speech for humans, but not robots’ though, when it comes to putting that into an AI, ‘it turns out to be hard to write that rule.’,The rules for artificial intelligences should be that they must be used for the ‘benefit of the many, not the few,’ said Schmidt, adding ‘they need to be invented in the sunlight,’ rather than a military lab, and they need to be accountable for what they do.,To deal with competition from countries such as Russia and China, Schmidt urged governments to invest more in basic research. He paid tribute to Britain’s remarkable scientific heritage, as epitomised in the collections of the Science Museum. ‘Let’s have more…let’s celebrate it.’,The
Tomorrow’s World
live event in the museum’s Information Age gallery asked does it help us now and what might it mean for our imminent futures, from
studying human intelligence
to autonomous cars? In other words,
what to think about machines that think
?,Expert systems are being considered for potentially life or death situations, notably in autonomous cars, and they should be regulated, said Schmidt. But regulators have to start with the human response, and Schmidt pointed out that the current death toll from car accidents is huge.,He said that a large number of people are working on ethics and fairness in decision-making for AI but the issue they face is the lack of agreement on ethical choices.,With Brian Cox he discussed what lies ahead for AI, prompted by questions from the audience in the Information Age gallery, which also included luminaries such as Sir Venki Ramakrishnan, President of the Royal Society and Dame Mary Archer, Chair of the Museum’s Board of Trustees, along with fellow trustees Anthon Valk, Sharon Flood and Lopa Patel.,Would jobs be destroyed? ‘We are not changing jobs, we are changing tasks’, said Schmidt, explaining how you could see evidence of that from previous technological revolutions, such as the steam age, ‘when you walk around this extraordinary museum’.,As for what people want from the technology, Schmidt said the number one request was a ‘robot to clean up kitchen and put all the dishes away…that certainly makes sense to me.’ But it turns out to be an ‘incredibly hard problem.’,Google, one of the most influential tech companies of the 21st century, is exploring the possibilities of AI with projects such as
DeepMind
, which is has an ambition to develop more flexible artificial general intelligence.,They discussed DeepMind’s remarkable advances in devising the first computer program to defeat a professional human Go player, the first program to defeat a Go world champion, and arguably the strongest Go player in history, among other
developments over the past year
. One leading Go player described how the invention of a particular move by the AI ‘was the biggest drama of my life,’ said Schmidt.,Last year, DeepMind set up
DeepMind Ethics & Society
, a new unit carrying out interdisciplinary research that brings together the technical insights of its company with the people who could be affected by AI.,An explosion in the field of AI came from the rise of so called deep learning, neural networks loosely modelled on the brain that are trained – notably with web data – to do jobs such as image recognition. However, as Schmidt pointed out, ‘the underlying mathematics is not fully understood.’,This was a concern, said Schmidt: because the underlying rationale for making a decision is not understood, ‘you should not use these things for life-critical decisions.’ Equally, so called expert systems have huge potential in advisory and recommendation systems, while real time language translation is now possible. ‘That changes everything.’,Though Moore’s law (the observation that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years) ‘is slowing down’, Schmidt raised the prospect of the next generation of so called quantum computing, expecting that ‘quantum supremacy’ would be demonstrated in the coming year.,He also raised the prospect of the neural networks that underlie machine intelligence being ‘automatically generated’. In other words, computers will generate the neural networks used for decision-making, since that job is becoming too hard for humans.,They pointed out some of the iconic objects around them in the gallery, such as Google’s ‘Cork board’ server (‘you turn it off, and the entire web search would go down’, said Schmidt) and Tim Berners-Lee’s
NeXTcube computer
, the original home of the world wide web (‘you turn that off, you turn the whole web off,’ joked Cox), which turned out to be a powerful platform to extend the use of information. ‘The web has become that,’ said Schmidt.,This was the fourth episode of ‘Tomorrow’s World Live’, after webcasts about

150,000 objects
, there remains a great deal to learn about almost every artefact in the Science Museum’s care. Despite the continued research efforts of our curatorial team, the historical story of an object can often be tantalisingly obscured. Understanding the history of an object is not a simple, linear process; each one has multiple stories and questions connected with it, and numerous potential angles for interpretation.,Take this object for an example. We already know a great deal about what it is, how it was used, and who owned it. However, there is a further level of detail that we wish to gain about the artefact- namely the experience associated with its therapeutic use.,This is a Milton Roy kidney machine, built for the treatment of patients with renal failure, via home based dialysis. When a person’s kidney’s fail, waste products cannot be removed from their blood. Dialysis machines such as this artificially filter the blood and ensure serious illness is adverted.,We know that this machine belonged to a lady called Moreen Lewis, who nicknamed it “Dr. Who”, and used it from 1966 until her death in 1976. The machine and associated treatments cost £7,000, a huge sum of money for the time, costing twice the amount of an average family home.,Much of what we know about this artefact and Moreen comes as a result of a book written by Keith Bill, called Plug in For Life. The book detailed Moreen’s life and the context of kidney treatment in 1960’s Britain. Further information on the machine was also provided by Moreen’s mother, Charlotte Lewis, who donated it to the Science Museum in 1977.,The machine is a significant part of the Museum’s medical collections as it represents one of the very earliest examples of home dialysis equipment. It also represents a moment of change in the treatment of kidney disease, placing patients like Moreen at the frontier of an expensive and experimental medical development. The costs associated with these dialysis machines meant that 1960’s renal units, funded by the National Health Service, were rare, small and rigorously selective. A unit was established at the

, London in 1961.,The failure to secure Moreen treatment on the NHS meant that private funds had to be found. The costs for treatment at the private National Kidney Centre in Finchley, London were met by Moreen’s uncle, this included the cost of the machine as well as the necessary training and support to successfully use the machine in her home. We also know that Moreen’s treatment was supported by a large network of friends, including those from the
Suffolks Baptist Church
in Enfield.,We are keen to build upon this knowledge and include the story of Moreen and her dialysis machine in a forthcoming
redisplay
of our medical collections. We are especially hopeful of uncovering some images of Moreen, so that they can support our gallery content. We are hoping to hear from people who may have known Moreen or her family, and can provide us with more detail about the everyday experience of using the machine.,We would also be keen to hear from any individuals, who have experience of using a Milton Roy machine such as the one Moreen used.,Perhaps you or a family member were a patient at the National Kidney Centre alongside Moreen? Maybe you attended the Suffolks Baptist Church like Moreen and her mother, or perhaps you were part of her wider group of friends?,Any further light you, or someone close to you, could shed on Moreen, this object and her experience of it in use, would be greatly received.,For more information about how to get in touch with us click

In 2014 alone, 93.4 million tonnes of fish were caught, with worldwide exports generating over £120 billion. It’s no wonder we want to look after our fish.,The majority of those consumed come from fish farms, where to keep disease at bay careful monitoring of water quality and nutrition is required. Fish are very sensitive, and are affected by all sorts of changes in water conditions including pH, temperature, oxygen levels and salt concentrations. Recently, one research team has come up with a rather ingenious way of monitoring water health without distressing the fish.,The old saying goes that there are plenty of fish in the sea, and now there is one more – but with a twist. Meet iTuna, your friendly neighbourhood robotic fish. Mimicking the appearance and movement of a real fish, the iTuna can change its swimming patterns in response to environmental stimuli. This lets it blend in with real fish while it quietly monitors anomalies in the water using biosensors.,The robotic fish was the result of an international collaboration between Professor Giovanna Marrazza of the
University of Florence
and Professor Claudio Rossi of the
Centre for Automation and Robotics
(CAR CSIC-UPM), a joint centre made up of researchers from the
Universidad Politécnica de Madrid
and the
Spanish National Research Council
.,Over 30 cm long, the prototype uses shape-memory alloy actuators and a flexible polycarbonate backbone to allow for lifelike movement. Ribs, attached to the backbone, support the synthetic swimming muscles and a latex-based outer skin.,Inside the iTuna, an electrochemical pH sensor measures water acidity. This pH sensor is formed of a polyaniline film deposited on a graphite electrode surface. The information provided by the sensor also controls the swimming patterns of the robotic fish.,The researchers hope this real-time monitoring system will help increase the health and wellbeing of our farmed fish.,The iTuna will be on display in our interactive

A turtle-robot hybrid example of this will be on display in our interactive
Tomorrow’s World
gallery until mid-October.,Robotics has come a long way. Advanced machines are being manufactured every day, but there are still many obstacles to overcome. Short battery life and difficulty making robust movement systems has hindered progress,
even the best robots can struggle
when it comes to motion.,That’s why scientists are turning to nature for inspiration.,Researchers at
KAIST
, the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, have developed a new
parasitic robot
that rides on the back of turtles. Incapable of movement itself, it uses a host to travel, controlling the direction in which it wants to go by flashing one of its five LED lights.,The device is far less dastardly than it sounds.
Unlike some parasites
which infect and alter their host’s central nervous system in order to control their behaviour, the parasitic robot influences the movement of its turtle host by giving it food rewards.,Turtles are trained for almost two months, first to become accustomed to wearing the robot, and then to associate the flashing LEDs with food.,The robot is attached to the shell of the turtle alongside a feeder tube and LED head display using special double-sided foam tape. The feeder tube is programmed to a release gelatine food capsule every time the turtle correctly follows the direction of a flashing LED light.,After five weeks of the turtle undergoing stimuli-response training, the parasitic robot is able to control the movement of its host, completing basic navigation tasks successfully.
The success of this study has encouraged researchers to consider future applications of these animal-robot partnerships, as well as other potential hosts; mice, birds and fish are all under consideration.,This isn’t the first time scientists have succeeded in controlling the movement of animals. Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley controlled the flight paths of beetles by strapping
tiny computers and wireless radios
onto their backs.,Most mobile robots are limited in complex environments, unable to adjust to unforeseen obstacles. But animals are perfectly adapted to their environments. The team at KAIST believe that harnessing the natural superior abilities of animals through parasitic robots could be a more efficient way to navigate complex environments.,It’s hoped these parasitic robots could get to places where humans can’t go, such as tight spaces or disaster zones. They could be used for surveillance or even military reconnaissance. Although parasitic robots raise important ethical concerns, these technologies have huge potential for use in harsh environments, and it will be interesting to see where the future of this scientific field takes us.,If you’re interested in finding out more about other types of robots, you can visit our
Robots
exhibition, which is on until 3 September.,The parasitic robot will be on display in our interactive

It sounds like a recipe for disaster, but when you’re asking real, new science questions, no-one knows what the answer will be.","At the Museum,Education",stem,"Call me crazy, but getting together a group of students aged 8 to 17 and making them work through the same set of tasks seems like a recipe for disaster. The huge differences in educational background and maturity would derail the process from the start. Right?,I thought so. But over the past 3 months, 20 students from four schools have proven me wrong in our
i, Scientist
program at the Science Museum. I think it came down to one important point: when you’re asking real, new science questions, no-one knows what the answer will be.,It’s the ultimate level playing field. In the program’s final day, a ten year old noticed a key trend in a data set that a PhD-educated scientist four times his age had missed. More importantly, he immediately put his hand up and explained what he’d spotted to the whole group, including Lottolab staff, teachers and his peers.,The i, Scientist program is much more than an exercise in getting students to do an experiment. It focuses on breaking down the idea that you need to ‘know a lot’ about something to ask a good, genuine question. In the words of a 12 year old, “I realised that science isn’t just facts in a classroom. But that it’s everywhere and there are so many things to be asked.”,These new questions led to real experiments, designed by the students. I worked with the oldest school group, who used members of the public as their experimental subjects. “Nerve-wracking”, was the one-word response from one of the group when they were asked how it felt to lay out their science to public scrutiny.,In the half hour before they brought in their first participants, the group were asking critical questions about every part of the experiment, cutting out all unnecessary bits. They were trying to find out if different people preferred either ‘familiar’ or ‘new’ routes when they were navigating. With results and demographics from 40 subjects, they had the meat and bones of a genuine science study – the last update I heard was that there were clear differences in preference, but the demographic analysis was still underway.,i, Scientist can be seen as an experiment itself: can people, of any age, engage with a scientific approach and collectively come up with new, answerable questions about the world? Do we really need years of training to be scientists?,It’s a challenging journey both for the students and the facilitators, because it’s not clear where it will lead. In science, results can be negative. But the development of the group, and individuals within it, was really noticeable. In the words of one 13 year old, “My learning in every subject has changed. I don’t see the obvious, I look at all the possibilities.”,David Robertson manages public programmes at Lottolab, and helped with the organisation of the latest i, Scientist program. Lottolab are looking to expand the program, with more schools participating in 2012."

It introduces the idea that there are patterns all around us and that recognising patterns is an important skill (especially in science).,Just like our other interactive galleries, when school groups book a visit, we provide a quick briefing before the kiddies go off and explore. The rules are simple. Don’t leave, don’t run and finally… have FUN!!!! And there’s a lot of fun to be had.,For starters in the centre of the gallery there’s a projection of animated fish that responds to movement. Children enjoy nothing more than to chase and stomp on the fishes. The magic of Disney is also evident when they shout out “Nemo!” to every clownfish that swims by.

walk like a dog

For the past few months I have volunteered at Lottolab and gained great insight into a totally unique and highly interactive museum experience.,Unlike other museum spaces, Lottolab doesn’t have many exhibits in the usual sense. In fact, on entering you could be forgiven for thinking you’ve stumbled into a forbidden section, perhaps a sort of experimental wing. And in a way you’d be right. Lottolab is experimental in so many ways; take a look at this video for an overview:,Rather than spending hours reading signs about old bits and pieces, here you’re more likely to find yourself approached by a rather charming volunteer and asked to take part in an experiment. Not just any old experiment though – a perception study (and they’re the most fun, because they’re about you!). You might even end up blindfolded, trying to navigate your way around a maze, using only an
iPod application
which converts colour into sound.,The most impressive part of the maze experiment is that it’s designed by kids. A key philosophy of Lottolab is that people shouldn’t only take part in experiments, but also make them. It’s this high level of public participation that inspires everything we do. Many of our studies end up published in scientific journals and so contribute to the formal advancement of scientific knowledge.,During my time at Lottolab, I created the short video you can see above, with Program Manager David Robertson explaining the lab and its mission (as well as showing people attempting the blindfold experiment). Hopefully it gives you a sense of what a totally unique and truly interactive place Lottolab is. Whether you want to take part in an experiment, suggest your own or simply admire some incredible tricks of the mind, there’s something for you here.,Lottolab are open in the Science Museum until the 20th of April, on Tuesdays and Wednesdays (12-4pm) next to the Energy Gallery on the second floor – though we hope to be reopening in a new-look gallery in the summer, so stay tuned if you don’t get to pay us a visit this time.

(Credit: Science Museum, London),If you think that’s confusing, you aren’t the only one. It was a common occurence in the nineteenth century for pharmacists to confuse medicines, sometimes with fatal results. For example, a pharmacist in 1858 mistook PULV OPII TURC OPT (Turkish Opium) for Turkish Rhubarb (RHEI TURC) causing a patient to die of an overdose, and was faced trial for manslaughter. Opium sales weren’t tightly controlled either. Until 1868, anyone could buy or sell opium regardless of whether they were a qualified chemist or not,Opium was not the only dangerous drug in the pharmacy. Most glass bottles containing potentially poisonous drugs were made to look and feel different as a warning to potential users. We call these poison bottles, and they are usually made of ribbed, coloured glass.

online public questionnaire
we ran back in March 2012, the report looks at the legacy of computer and the BBC’s broader
Computer Literacy Project
. We received 372 responses to the questionnaire, with many people leaving detailed responses about their experiences of using computers in the 1980s and the influence it had on their subsequent careers paths.,Despite the
BBC Micro
being remembered as a schools machine, the report shows that the Computer Literacy Project initially aimed to improve adult computer literacy in the home. It was supported by a range of materials, distributed across a multitude of channels, and enabled local networks to deliver learning directly to many different audiences.,The report also highlights how the Computer Literacy Project had significant economic benefits, creating an increasingly skilled population and stimulating a high technology innovation cluster aroundCambridge. It suggests that any new initiatives which aim to increase computer literacy, such as the
Raspberry Pi
, should include the need for a strong vision for computer literacy, leadership to coordinate activities, and a desire to create change in the home as well as schools.,The report is available through the

You’d open fire.  If you were lucky you could hit as many as 50 birds in one go.,The recoil was so powerful and violent it sent the boat backwards for several yards. This meant that the gun had to be fixed to the hull which, in turn, meant you had to manoeuvre the
punt
to aim again.  Unfortunately, as well as the risk of missing altogether there was the added problem that you had to take the vessel back to shore to reload.,More on the British Small Craft displays in a future post."

Find out what he had to say in our guest blog post from Roger Highfield ",Science in the news,,"By
Roger Highfield,The most influential scientist in the country came to the
Science Museum
last night to give a unique overview of how he has advised the Prime Minister over the years.,,As he approaches the end of his time as Government Chief Scientific Adviser, and with his successor
Sir Mark Walport
now waiting in the wings Professor Sir John Beddington was in a reflective mood during his lecture, given in association with the Association of British Science Writers (ABSW) and our monthly
Lates
event.,Like his two predecessors, Sir John has had to spend an inordinate amount discussing badgers, and their role in bovine tuberculosis. The issues he has handled have stretched from shale gas and space weather to black swans. ‘It’s a mad job,” he joked.,Since he stepped into the hot seat at the start of 2008, Sir John has given key advice to Government during a number of huge stories, such as the 2009 swine flu outbreak, the 2010 volcanic ash incident, and the 2011 Fukushima nuclear crisis.,Sir John described how, as chair of Sage (Science Advisory Group in Emergencies) that feeds in to Cobra (a reference to Cabinet Office Briefing Room A, used to handle a crisis), he had to reassure Prime Minister David Cameron that, despite the more hysterical press reports, the wider radiological fallout of Fukushima was much less than Britons would encounter if they evacuated Tokyo on a flight to London.,The ability of Government to make appropriate use of science has been a central issue. He has been responsible for forming a network of those with science and engineering backgrounds within government (now around 4000 strong at the last count) and encouraging all major departments of state to recruit a Chief Scientific Adviser: he illustrated this with a PowerPoint slide of mugshots of the 18 Government Chief Scientists, including a shadowy androgynous cut-out figure in MI5.,One might quibble about the details of how well this is working but, as a Lords Select Committee recently concluded, these advisors are critical, not least because they deal with issues that cut across departments and that can outlive the lifetimes of politicians, such as securing food and energy.,Throughout 2008 and 2009 Sir John raised the concept of the “Perfect Storm” of food, energy and water security in the context of climate change, a global population that will soar by a billion in the next 13 years, and the ever-increasing proportion in vulnerable urban environments, raising this as a priority for the international community.,Sir John has led the way in producing report after report working through the consequences, notably the link between food insecurity and social unrest. And, in response to a question from the audience, he welcomed the move by the United Nations to appoint its own Chief Scientist to help deal with these huge issues.,When it came to last week’s Rio+20 summit, Sir John diplomatically avoided any explicit expression of his disappointment about the outcome, stating that he felt it was better that decisions were made than not at all. However, it was perhaps significant that the most he could find to say about his trip was how bad the weather was in Rio.,At a “Resilient Cities” event the summit Sir John made an urgent appeal for scientists to use plain language if they are to play a larger role in policymaking on climate change, notably to convey an accurate measure of the risks. One example is the use of GM crops to do away with pesticides, where the existing risks of intensive farming are often neglected in the public debate.,He adopted a high profile during the recent furore about genetically altered crops, as demonstrators gathered to protest against the planting of GM wheat in open fields at
Rothamsted Research
in Hertfordshire. Sir John argued that GM had to be part of a bigger plan to feed the world and predicted enormous increases in the demand for GM food, without which we could expect increased food prices that would harm the poorest of the poor, in particular.,When asked by Bob Ward of the
Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment
about the legacy of the ‘Climategate’ e-mails that were hacked from the University of East Anglia, Sir John pointed out that he thought some climate scientists had been harassed through the use of the Freedom of Information Act, but rightly stressed the need for openness and transparency, and to make data available so that research results can be tested through replication.,Sir John was surprisingly outspoken in his criticism of how poorly he feels the European Union is dealing with some issues of risk, highlighting, for instance, the problem of banning some substances purely because of their potential hazard, but failing to take into account whether the low levels of exposure actually constitute any significant risk to public health. On one point in particular, he could not hide his exasperation: “there is complete idiocy.”,I asked Sir John if the Chief Scientist should have more power to decide policy, rather than just advise? This would not be unprecedented: in monetary policy, a huge amount of power is devolved to Mervyn King and the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee, presumably because politicians recognise that monetary policy is complex and should be left to the experts.,Surely the same be more true when it comes to aspects of science and engineering policy? No, came back the reply, because power corrupts. It is better to provide advice and insights and, as one example, he explained how a committee is now investigating the use of computer trading in financial markets, where avalanches of pre-programmed trading – up to a quarter of a million per second – can cause huge shifts in share price and market instability.,He also revealed his guiding principle when it comes to dealing with Government and NGOs alike, quoting Steven Chu, the Nobel prize winning physicist who is currently Energy Secretary in the United States: “People are entitled to their own opinions, but not their own facts”"

After an hour or so shuffling along the Downs I can feel almost human.,,So when the Science Museum was scouting around for ideas for a booklet to tie in with the Summer of Sport I thought that perhaps it was time to celebrate the everyday runners who, like me, may fall a little short of Elite standards, but whose heroism is marked by the fact that they manage to crawl out of bed on a Sunday morning and head out into the rain.,The booklet will be launched at the

floats
in oceans across the world.

There are currently over 3000 floats in circulation.,,All Alone: Every year new floats are deployed building an ever more dynamic picture of our oceans,One of the most significant features about Argo data is that it is freely available to anyone (

oceanographers
to quickly draw seemingly conclusive analytical reports about trends and changes in our oceans.,However, the accessibility of the survey network can lead to problems. Information published has not always been accurate and science writers are quick to use Argo data to shape and support their theories, rather than allowing the data to collate over time to form more conclusive readings.,It is expected that in the not too distant future, the Argo global dataset will provide crucial indications that global warming is happening. Some feel that there is already enough evidence to support this theory and that we should take immediate action to combat its effects.,Let’s pretend for a moment that the people of the world have put their absolute faith in your hands. How would you use Argo data findings? Consider:,Can we really suggest global warming is occurring based on monitoring the oceans alone?,To get a truly conclusive indication that climate change is happening might take many more years of Argo data observation.

, and we’re currently scouting out objects and stories for the show. This post is the first in a series about the exhibition. Myself and
Harry Cliff
from the LHC exhibition team ventured to Liverpool to take a closer look at the detector that sits at the heart of the LHCb experiment.,,The Oliver Lodge building, home to the Universityof Liverpool particle physics department, is a typically plain post-war block. But inside, technicians and researchers constructed one of the most beautiful parts of the
Large Hadron Collider
(LHC): the LHCb Vertex Locator or “VELO”.,The VELO is a precision engineered piece of equipment, and we had to put on teletubby-style outfits to enter the clean room where the modules were painstakingly put together. A peek through a microscope at a spare module revealed the intricate detail in each board; hundreds of perfectly aligned connections, delicate strips of silicon and tiny computer chips.,But once assembled, the modules are surprisingly hardy. Some were taken to the LHC in Geneva in hand baggage on an easyJet flight; brave researchers drove the rest through the Channel tunnel in a hire car. Once they arrived, this incredibly intricate device was carefully put in position. It sits just millimetres from awesome power of the LHC’s proton beams, enduring high levels of radiation for years on end without missing a beat.,Most of media flurry about the LHC has concentrated on the hunt for the Higgs boson. LHCb has a different mission. As Dr Tara Shears explained, our universe is made of normal matter, not its mirror image,
antimatter
, and at LHCb scientists are attempting to find out where the antimatter has gone.,The LHC collides protons at near light speed. The energy of the crash creates new particles that spray out in all directions. Our host at Liverpool, Dr Girish Patel, explained that the VELO comprises 42 modules, which are lined up in pairs to form circular detectors – the proton beams travel through the hole in the centre of each pair. The pairs are lined up along the beam to record the trajectory of the new particles.,The VELO allows scientists to work out precisely where particles were created, to within a hundredth of a millimetre. It is surrounded by much larger detectors that identify what types of particle were made in each collision. LHCb is looking for a type of particle known as a bottom quark. It doesn’t detect the bottom particles directly, because they decay into other particles before they reach VELO. LHCb tracks these other particles, looking for the fingerprint of the bottom quark among the mass of data.,Thanks to everyone at Liverpool for a fascinating day, particularly Girish, Tara and Themis.

September, we will be sharing the excitement generated by this research.,On the day we would like to invite everyone who is interested in learning more about the history of museum display and science on TV to join us for a workshop in which we will present some of our findings, and share first thoughts on the next steps for this fascinating project. It will be the occasion to hear people who made this history, in theScienceMuseumand at the BBC science department, telling us their sides of the story.,The event, starting early in the afternoon, will be in two parts. The first bit, more suited to people with a specialist interest, will be a research academic workshop. It will involve a presentation of findings from the research and a hands-on session during which participants will be offered the opportunity to reflect on an individual science broadcast. The second part of the day, open to the public, will consist in a ciné-club style session. A
Horizon Special
will be screened in the presence of former producers and editors of the programme.

Make it in Great Britain
exhibition.,Inventing is Trevor’s life long passion, and after seeing a programme in 1991 about the spread of AIDS in Africa, he set about inventing a wind up radio. Three years later, his first working prototype ran for 14 minutes and it was featured on the BBC’s Tomorrow’s World programme. By 1996, the radio had been awarded the BBC Design Award for Best Product and Best Design, and in the same year, Trevor met both Her Majesty The Queen and Nelson Mandela.,Yet despite Trevor’s achievements, his view that “there is an invention in all of us” has not changed, and he dismisses the suggestion that to be an inventor you have to wear a white coat.,,As Trevor strolled around the exhibition he looked up at the Rolls Royce jet engine (pictured above), describing the legendary inventor Frank Whittle, as just “a young lad with a good idea”. Trevor explained that ideas do not have to be as complex as the jet engine or as ingenious as BEA’s unmanned aircraft, the demon, and that often it’s just down to luck, “you do not have to be a genius, often inventions are just pure chance.”,Before he left, Trevor told us that “art is pleasure, invention is treasure”, and we hope the exhibition has gone some way to showcase this belief by championing one the UK’s greatest assets, its manufacturing industry.,The

‘Heroes of Science’
earlier this week.,Modern science is now so often a global collaborative effort, with thousands of researchers joining forces on gigantic scientific undertakings such as the
Large Hadron Collider
,
ENCODE
and the Polymath Project. As research teams have become the norm in scientific discovery, many are asking is modern science is too big for heroes?,Roger disagrees, arguing in his lecture (and in this
Daily Telegraph
article) that “it would be a disaster if we provided an uninspiring vision of scientific advance as a relentless march of an army of ants.” The likes of Isaac Newton or Marie Curie, who won two Nobel prizes before dying due to prolonged radiation exposure, provide inspirational stories of scientific discovery, and these stories continue to this day through figures such as Peter Higgs, Craig Venter and Sir Tim Berners-Lee.,These scientists would never claim to have worked alone, but this is often how they are portrayed. In the crowded realm of ideas, heroes are often the most viral transmitters of the values of science. Our fascination with heroes could perhaps be explained by recent
brain
scan studies by Francesca Happé and colleagues in London, which show the existence of a hard-wired fondness for narratives in us all.,Roger ended his lecture with a final thought on the use of metaphors to convey complex ideas, noting that by the same token, heroic characters who appreciate scientific discovery are needed to express a vivid sense of the way science works.,The

October
1805, a small projectile (shown in the above engraving), fired at a range of about 50ft, passed into Admiral Horatio Nelson’s left shoulder and, ricocheting against bone, tore a path through his upper body before passing into his lower back.  The musket ball took with it fragments of the his coat and its epaulette which remained attached after it came to rest.,Nelson died a few hours later as the Battle of Trafalgar drew to a close, and after prolonged preservation, in first brandy and then distilled wine, and after much public procession and fanfare, his body was buried in St Paul’s Cathedral on the 9
th
January 1806.,Here is an invitation to the funeral from our collections.  The recipient was
Dr Leonard Gillespie
, “Physician to Lord Nelson”.  Indeed Gillespie had actually been assigned to the post of Physician-General to the Fleet by Nelson whilst abroad
HMS Victory
– the ship he was officially attached to.  But while Nelson was attended by the Victory’s surgeon
William Beatty
on that fatal day, where was Gillespie?,Dr Gillespie had overseen an enlightened approach to on-board health, which just prior to Trafalgar he described as “unexampled perhaps in any squadron heretofore employed on a foreign station”.  He had also written an influential pamphlet on the
Preservation of the Health of Seamen
, which put particular emphasis on a good diet, but in October 1805 Gillespie himself was not a well man.  As Nelson was taking that fatal shot, Gillespie was ashore, laid low with
gout
!,While
scurvy
is the dietary complaint traditionally associated with life at sea in the early 1800s, gout was not uncommon.  Linked in part to diets rich in meat, seafood and alcohol, the naval officer class was prone to the condition.  Although Gillespie missed his masters final moments, his gouty absence was no cause for shame.  Indeed,
according to William Beatty
, it was only through “abstaining for the space of nearly two years from animal food, and wine and all other fermented drink; confining his diet to vegetables, and commonly milk and water” that Nelson overcame his own bout…of gout.,As for Gillespie, he outlived Nelson by nearly three decades,
dying at 83
after a long retirement in Paris.  However, in a curious postscript, ‘Dr Leonard Gillespie’ emerged a century later in a very different context.  Firstly in books, then on cinema and TV screens, as the elderly mentor to the titular young medic in the hugely successful

, a Physicist working on the LHCb experiment and the first Science Museum Fellow of Modern Science, writes about a new discovery at
CERN
for our blog. A new
Science Museum
exhibition about the
Large Hadron Collider
will open in November 2013, showcasing particle detectors and the stories of scientific discoveries.,There were high hopes that the world’s most powerful particle collider would find evidence for the theory of
supersymmetry
, which postulates that every member of the known bestiary of sub-atomic particles has a related but much more massive “super-partner”. The theory is considered more elegant than the current
Standard Model of particles
and forces and is particularly appealing as some of these supersymmetric particles, or “sparticles”, could account for the “dark matter” that sculpts the structure of the visible universe.,But the experiment I work on at the
Large Hadron Collider
(LHC) has spotted of one of the rarest particle decays ever seen in nature, a result that poses a serious challenge to supporters of “new physics” theories like supersymmetry.,Results presented at the Hadron Collider Physics conference in Kyoto early this morning show the first convincing evidence for a particle called a Bs meson decaying into two muons. The decay was seen by my colleagues at the
LHC beauty
(LHCb) experiment, a gigantic particle detector on the 27km LHC ring at CERN, near Geneva.,This process is predicted to be very rare in the Standard Model, but if ideas like supersymmetry are correct then it could be much more common. However, the decay seems to be just as rare as the Standard Model predicted.,As we sat sharing a coffee at the
Cavendish lab in Cambridge
, Dr Marc-Olivier Bettler, a member of the international team who produced the result, told me it puts “strong constraints” on supersymmetry.,Rarer than winning the lottery
The LHC has been smashing protons into each other at close to the speed of light almost non-stop since November 2009. Each collision creates a shower of new particles, and occasionally a Bs meson is produced. The LHCb detector was built to study exotic these exotic particles.,Dr Bettler and his colleagues churned through hundreds of trillions of collisions produced by the LHC in search of the decay. The huge amount of data recorded by the LHCb experiment was processed using a world-wide network of computer processors known as the Grid. In the end they turned up just a handful of likely candidates.,Their results show that the chance of a Bs meson converting to two muons is about one in 300 million. That’s thirty times less likely than winning the jackpot on the lottery with a single ticket.,New physics hiding
Finding evidence of the decay is a triumph for
LHCb
, but will be a big disappointment for theorists who have spent many years working on supersymmetry. Prof. Val Gibson, leader of the LHCb group at the University of Cambridge said “this key result is putting our supersymmetry theory colleagues in a spin”. The result also makes it much less likely that the other main LHC experiments, ATLAS and CMS, will discover signs of supersymmetric particles any time soon. “If new physics is present then it is hiding very well behind the Standard Model” said Dr Bettler.,Even though it may be less thrilling than discovering
new particles
or forces of nature, these extremely precise measurements are crucial to improving our understanding of the Universe. “This result is important because it tells us what new physics isn’t.” Dr Bettler certainly didn’t find the outcome disappointing, describing his reaction at seeing the results for the first time two weeks ago as “wow! I was very excited. It has been a very exciting two weeks, that’s for sure.”,Visitors to the Science Museum will have a chance to get up close and personal with the LHC at a new
exhibition
opening in November 2013. The exhibition will showcase real pieces of the LHC, including an intricate particle detector from the heart of the LHCb experiment."

While this might seem like good news, for some people it is the opposite, because a well-behaved Higgs might rule out some intriguing new physics theories.","Exhibitions and Galleries,Science in the news","collider,einstein,physics","Last week scientists working on the
Large Hadron Collider
in Geneva updated their colleagues on the newly-discovered Higgs boson. They revealed what they now know about the particle – and so far, it is behaving exactly as they expected. While this might seem like good news, for some people it is the opposite, because a well-behaved Higgs might rule out some intriguing new physics theories.,The Higgs – the particle which explains why others have mass – is incredibly unstable and only exists for a fraction of a second before decaying into other, more common particles. Any information about it comes second-hand from these other particles, and working out the properties is rather like putting together clues in a Sherlock Holmes tale, only with more mathematics.,Finding the Higgs in
July
was a wonderful coup for the LHC, but there now follows years of painstaking work to determine its precise properties. If the Higgs behaves even a smidgen differently from predictions, then it might point scientists in the direction of a new theory.,One particularly popular idea has the rather grand name of “supersymmetry”, which as we wrote on
this blog
last week, is looking less likely to be true.,There are lots of problems with current theories about the Universe – they don’t explain
dark matter
, and particle physics is completely incompatible with
Einstein’s
theories of gravity. Supersymmetry solves some of these issues in a whizz of complicated mathematics, but requires the existence of a whole family of new particles. If they exist, the Higgs’ properties should reveal them.,The results announced on Wednseday in Japan don’t lend the under-fire supersymmetry any more support. They suggest that so far, the Higgs behaves just as our current theory predicts it should. Specifically, when it decays, it turns into different types of particles at the rates we expect.,To some in the community, the Higgs’ conformity is rather disappointing.  But not all of the analysis was ready for the Japan conference and there is still uncertainty around the results that were announced, and supersymmetry still could work.,Even though the LHC has already analysed more data in two years than its predecessor managed in twenty, the measurements are not yet particularly precise, and the Higgs may still harbour surprises. The LHC still has not detected a Higgs decaying into quarks (the smallest unit of matter), for example – we just know that since we haven’t seen it yet, it can’t happen often. In other words: watch this space.,Visitors to the Science Museum will have a chance to get up close and personal with the LHC at a new

Jennifer fought off tough competition from a shortlist of ten young designers, aged between 16 and 22, to win the prize and will have the unique opportunity to see her trophy presented to the winner of the Queen Elizabeth Prize at the inaugural ceremony in March 2013. Following the announcement the delighted Jennifer thanked the judges and congratulated her fellow competitors commenting on the quality and range of all the designs in the room.,The panel, who had the tough job of selecting the trophy, consisted of: Science Museum Director and Chair of judges, Ian Blatchford; architect Dame
Zaha Hadid
; Director of the

Design Museum
Director, Deyan Sudjic; and Engineer, Yewande Akinola. During the judging competitors were asked to explain the inspiration behind their design and what material would best fit their trophy but, on announcing the winner, Ian admitted that the judges had to add two additional criteria to help them whittle it down and come to a decision – whether the Queen would take pleasure from handing the prize and how the winner of the QE prize might feel when collecting their award. The winning trophy was described as “jewel-like” and was praised for its strong design which reflected the creativity, power and importance of engineering in the world today.,,Reflecting on the competition Ian Blatchford said, “We set a challenge for young people to come up with an iconic trophy design that best embodies the wonder of modern engineering and reflects the merging worlds of science, art, design and engineering. Jennifer has shown real imagination and talent – all the judges were enormously impressed with her design.”,At the awards ceremony at the Science Museum’s Smith Centre, all ten of the shortlisted designers saw their trophy brought to life having had their design transformed into 3D printed prototypes by BAE Systems using the latest in
Additive Layer Manufacturing technology
. These replicas illustrated the intricate designs of each of the trophies which varied from Alexander Goff’s ‘Flowers and Thorns’ a towering structure of petals and sharp thorns, to Gemma Pollock’s ‘Bright Perceptions’ that centred around a double helix, and Dominic Jacklin’s ‘The Nest’ a vortex of geometric shapes which was concieved to represent the ubiquity of engineering in our lives.,,The QE prize is a new £1 million global engineering prize, launched in 2012 which rewards and celebrates an individual (or up to three people) responsible for a ground-breaking innovation in engineering that has been of global benefit to humanity. The first winner of the QE prize will be announced in March 2013 and will be presented with Jennifer’s trophy by the Queen in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace."
https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/150-years-of-the-london-underground/,Selina Hurley,150 Years Of The London Underground,,Collections and Objects,,"This blog post was written by Pippa Murray,Today marks the 150
th
anniversary of the opening of the London Underground – arguably one of London’s most iconic landmarks. Of course back in 1863, when the first tube line opened, the map looked remarkably different from the one we know today with only the metropolitan line running between Paddington and then onto Farringdon Street (a stretch measuring only six kilometers). Yet as the network of tunnels evolved throughout the late 19
th
century and into the 20
th
the construction of the underground system was considered one of the great engineering feats of modern times with the world’s only steam-driven underground railway and the first electrified underground railway. As well as having profound effects on the ability of the Londoners to move around the city quickly, cheaply and alleviating the level of congestion on London roads.,,,,,As you can see in some of these images the construction work utilised the ‘cut and cover’ technique where the pavement of the street is removed, a hole for the subway and stations is dug, and then the street is restored.,,Naturally since the Metropolitan line was built technology has evolved and one of the newer lines to be built using more sophisticated tools was the Victoria line. This line took 20 years from the initial planning stages to opening in stages between 1968-1971, and was considered one of the most complex tunnel engineering of its time and. instead of the cut and cover approach, diggers like the Drum digger tunnelling machine (pictured above) were used to excavate deep down underneath some of the capitals major landmarks such as Buckingham Palace and government departments. It took approximately 2500 miners to excavate an estimated one million tons of earth and along the way a whole deluge of debris was uncovered from fossilised marine molluscs to human bones from an old plague pit.,So whilst commuters continue to moan and groan about the tube on their way to work this morning I think today of all days we all should celebratethe London Underground and recognize it as a world class feat of engineering.,"
https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/electricity-galvanizer-and-destroyer/,Selina Hurley,Electricity! Galvanizer And Destroyer,,Collections and Objects,medicine,"This blog post was written by Johanna Stevens-Yule,Luigi Galvani
and Alessandro Volta both made names for themselves with their pioneering work on electricity—however; electricity would prove to be the destructive force to the majority of their actual instruments.,Here at the Science Museum we find ourselves in the position of owning Galvani’s very own electrostatic machine, but this so very easily might not have been the case. Unlike several other pieces of Galvani’s equipment, it escaped being destroyed in an 1899 fire.,,By rotating the disc on the electrostatic machine it was possible to create an electrical charge. Galvani, an Italian physician working in the eighteenth century, experimented on nerve stimulation, mainly in frogs, using this electrostatic machine. Galvani used the electrostatic machine along with other equipment to help develop his theory that electricity ran through the nerves in animals’ bodies.,During these famous experiments Galvani would typically shock nerve fibres and muscles in frogs’ legs with static electricity and observe the effects. From this Galvani concluded that electricity must flow through animals’ bodies to cause a contraction along the muscles and termed this ‘animal electricity’.,,Galvani died in 1798. About a century later, the electrostatic machine, along with about 30 other items of Galvani’s experimental equipment, ended up in the hands of Professor Giuseppe Fabbi of Bologna (Galvani’s hometown). Fabbi loaned a small selection of these objects to the Esposizione Voltiana in Como (Volta’s hometown) commemorating both Galvani and Volta (but mostly Volta) for their work in electricity.,The exhibition proved to be a massive success; however, disaster struck on the 8
th
June 1899. In a rather ironic twist the fusing of an electric wire caused a fire to break out, burning down the entire building, taking the Galvani andVolta material with it.,Fortunately for us, Fabbi, a patriotic son of Bologna, decided not to loan Galvani’s most important apparatus, like the electrostatic machine, to the exhibition in Como. Instead he kept it for his own collection which he later sold on, meaning the machine is still in existence today and is now part of the Science Museum’s Galvani collection. These objects are traces of the work conducted by one of the great pioneers of electrical experimentation, and will be featured in a temporary exhibition opening in September 2013 on the history of electrical stimulation of the nerves and brain.,"

Cosmonauts
event with Buzz Aldrin and Professor Brian Cox,Mars has been the ultimate objective for five US presidents and getting there is ‘the easy part,’ Dr
Buzz Aldrin
said at a special IMAX Theatre event in the Science Museum today (28 February 2016).,The aim should be to ‘keep Mars occupied’, said Dr Aldrin, who made history on 20 July, 1969, when he became the first to land on another world, along with Neil Armstrong, in the ‘giant leap for mankind’ made by the
Apollo 11
mission.,He was visiting the Museum today (28 February 2016) to help inspire the next generation of Mars explorers and discuss the next step to the red planet and beyond, at a special Q and A with the physicist and broadcaster, Prof Brian Cox, after which Dr Aldrin signed his latest books about Mars.,Dr Aldrin believes that mankind could touch down on the red planet by 2040 and estimates that the generation of children born around the year 2000 will be the first to make the long journey.,Cooperation, not competition, with other nations such as Russia, Japan and China, along with the European Space Agency, are the key to colonising Mars, according to Dr Aldrin, who has a vision of establishing a population of “several hundred” on Mars, a number that would be grown.,Competition ‘would make it very very messy’ and no one nation can do it alone. ‘We must come together’ he said.,A colony would also require a constant ‘cycling pathways’ to get people and supplies from the Earth to Mars. He has devised a master plan known as the “Aldrin Mars Cycler” – an arrangement of spacecraft with perpetual cycling orbits between Earth and Mars. ‘It gets more economical that way.’,Prof Stephen Hawking
has hailed the Apollo 11 Moon landing as humanity’s greatest achievement , said Prof Cox, and today Dr Aldrin replied that it was ‘a bold step of conquest,’ not least because the commitment to go to the moon came when America had not even put a human in orbit.,In discussing the Apollo landing, Dr Aldrin admitted when it came the various launch systems under consideration,  one key concern was ensuring that they beat
Alexei Leonov
to the moon, who was being trained for a landing by the Soviet Union in the mid-sixties in a single cosmonaut lander.,He added that the Soviets had developed many unmanned moon probes in their
Luna programme
, starting with an impact landing on the moon in 1959.,Prof Cox asked him how it felt to pilot a Saturn V launch vehicle at the lift off of Apollo 11. “You are not piloting, you are along for the ride,” Dr Aldrin explained, adding the Saturn V was ‘a great rocket.’,Apollo 11 was also remarkable because in previous missions, spacecraft were never abandoned by both members of the crew, as was the case with the Apollo 11 moon lander when both Armstrong and Aldrin stepped out onto the Moon’s surface.,With Armstrong, Dr Aldrin spent 21 hours on the lunar surface as fellow crewmember Michael Collins orbited overhead and they returned with 46 pounds of moon rocks.,He explained later, in response to a question from the audience, ‘An iPhone has more computing power than our spacecraft did in 1969 – I get a little resentful! Our computers did complicated manoeuvres. Do you think if I threw and iPhone up in the air that it would be able to make a star sighting or manoeuvre corrections?”,An estimated 600 million people – at that time, the world’s largest television audience in history – witnessed this unprecedented heroic endeavour. ‘It all worked out pretty good,’ he said.,That morning, Buzz Aldrin’s
ShareSpace
Foundation, a non-profit organisation which aims to inspire children in science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics, had debuted its Giant Destination Mars Map in Britain at the Science Museum. The map was created with the help of NASA and Mars experts.,Children, starting with those from the charity Family Action Medway, gathered on the 25’ by 25’ map to build their own version of Mars landers using everyday objects with guidance from Aldrin and ShareSpace Executive Director Linn LeBlanc. One asked Aldrin how he went to the loo in space and he explained how he was the first to pee on the moon, using a Urine Collection Device on his
spacesuit
.,In the Science Museum, visitors can see the Apollo 10 command module, which was vital for preparations to land on the Moon, and a model of the ‘Eagle’ Apollo 11 moon lander, the Lunar Excursion Module, both of which were visited by Dr Aldrin today.,Dr Aldrin is an author of nine books including his New York Times best-selling autobiography ‘Magnificent Desolation’ and  ‘Mission to Mars: My Vision for Space Exploration’ which outlines his plan to get us beyond the moon and on to Mars. He has also written illustrated children’s books, including ‘Welcome to Mars: Making a Home on the Red Planet’.,The event was one of a series to mark the museum’s landmark
Cosmonauts: Birth of the Space Age
exhibition, which ends on 13 March 2016. Both
Brian Cox
and Dr
Buzz Aldrin
have visited.,Born 20 January, 1930 in Montclair, New Jersey as Edwin Eugene Aldrin, Jr., he received his nickname “Buzz” when his little sister pronounced the word brother as “buzzer” and the shortened form took hold (he legally changed his name to Buzz in 1985). Dr Aldrin joined the Air Force and flew F86 Sabre Jets in 66 combat missions in Korea, shot down two MIG-15s, and was decorated with the Distinguished Flying Cross. He went on to earn his Doctorate of Science in Astronautics at MIT, where he wrote his thesis on Manned Orbital Rendezvous. This returned to haunt him after he was selected by NASA in 1963 and, being the first with a doctorate, he became known as “Dr Rendezvous.”,The docking and rendezvous techniques he devised for spacecraft in Earth and lunar orbit became critical to the success of the Gemini and Apollo programs, and are still used by astronauts today. He also talked today about how he pioneered underwater training techniques, as a substitute for zero gravity flights, to simulate spacewalking.,He told the IMAX audience about another first – the ‘space selfie’, taken when he noticed the position of the cameras during the Gemini 12 mission spacewalk in November 1966. ‘It turned out pretty good,’ said Dr Aldrin. Improving the lighting would have meant moving the Sun or orbit, he joked.,Dr Aldrin was interviewed by Professor Brian Cox, Advanced Fellow of particle physics in the School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Manchester, Royal Society Professor for Public Engagement in Science and a presenter of numerous science programmes including BBC2’s Stargazing Live."

were decommissioned in 2012.,The models have been subject to careful conservation over the intervening years and Anderson and Low took the unusual step of viewing them through the slightly opaque sheeting used to protect them from dust and degeneration.,Creating images of the models this way, the sheeting acted like a prism to reveal how the models contained inner dramas which were just waiting to be discovered.,The resulting images look almost like paintings and as Anderson and Low explained “push the boundaries of what a photograph is supposed to do.”,Rather than represent photography as a purely representational art, or as an instrument to examine the detailed structures of these models, they have transformed the medium into a means to enthral, beguile and enchant.,Voyages can be seen in the Media Space gallery until 25 June."

) for the invention that has the biggest impact on their lives today during the live show. The winning invention will be revealed at the end of
Britain’s Greatest Invention
.,The objects in
our collection
can help tell unique stories, from the extraordinary to the everyday. But there are some objects whose stories remain a mystery. As part of
Britain’s Greatest Invention
, we’re asking for your help to uncover the stories behind two incredible objects.,These
‘Jedi’ helmets
were worn by children and adults in the 1980s to aid MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scans of their brains. The coils act as aerials, and the helmets were named after the Jedi knights in Star Wars to encourage children not to be frightened.,We want to know what it was like to wear and use one of these helmets, so
get in touch
if you have used one or know someone who did.,We acquired
this prosthetic arm
in the late 1990s, but know tantalisingly little about it. It was designed so the pianist who used it could span an octave on a piano, with padded thumb and little finger tips to ensure the wooden fingers could not be heard on the piano keys. The hand is detachable, so the woman who owned this limb may have used other prosthetic hands too.,We know the pianist performed at the Royal Albert Hall in 1906, but after lots of research we’ve not been able to find out any information about her life.,The prosthetic limb was made by Mr Rowden of 13 Abingdon Street, Northampton, and we are interested in his story too. If you know anything about this mysterious pianist or Mr Royden, do
get in touch
.,In 1951 the Festival of Britain was held, celebrating the centenary of the 1851 Great Exhibition and promoting British science, technology, design architecture and the arts. This national exhibition was seen by millions of people across the UK. The Science Museum even built a new part of the museum to house the
Festival of Britain Exhibition of Science
.,We have a
small number of objects
from the Festival of Britain in our collections, but our curators are looking to acquire more objects which complement our existing collections. If you have science-themed items from the Festival’s Exhibition of Science – such as plates, cutlery, glassware, menus, posters or even objects from the exhibition itself – we
want to hear from you
. We would also love to hear from people who remember visiting the Festival of Britain Exhibition of Science, so we can capture these stories too.,Britain’s Greatest Invention will broadcast live from the Science Museum Group’s stores on 15 June from 20.30-22.00 on BBC Two.

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/john-smeaton-whirling-speculum/,Dr Elizabeth Bruton,John Smeaton and his whirling speculum,Explore the life and work of civil engineer John Smeaton,Collections and Objects,"engineering,medicine,physics","Known as the “father of civil engineering”,
John Smeaton
(born in Yorkshire on 8 June 1724) is best known for his successful career as a professional civil engineer.,He had particular expertise in canals, bridges, harbours and other infrastructure projects, but it was the construction of the
Eddystone lighthouse
between 1755 and 1759 which truly cemented (if you excuse the pun) his reputation as a talented and ingenious civil engineer.,However, it was Smeaton’s earlier work in mathematical and scientific instrument-making, and especially his work on an improved ‘whirling speculum’, a pre-cursor to the modern gyroscope, which influenced his later work and successes.,,Born in Austhorpe, Leeds on 8 June 1724, Smeaton’s background was not in the field of civil engineering but rather law. Smeaton’s father encouraged his son to follow him into the legal profession but Smeaton’s childhood interest in taking things apart and putting them back together instead came to the fore. Smeaton had the ability to quickly pick up the technical skills from those around him, to put them into practice and many times to improve them, an
early biographer
described him as “born an engineer.”,Nonetheless his father was concerned that his son wouldn’t be able to make a decent career from his tinkering and engineering ability and so sent him to London in 1742 to pursue an education and career in law.,Within a few years, Smeaton realised the legal profession was not for him and persuaded his father to support his career as a philosophical (scientific) instrument maker in London in the late 1740s (dates in historic accounts vary). In parallel with Smeaton’s instrument-making career, Smeaton became heavily involved with the Royal Society with one of his early papers, “
An Account of some Experiments upon a Machine for measuring the Way of a Ship at Sea
”, being submitted in 1753 and read in 1754, and around this time Smeaton’s talents were recognised by becoming a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS).,Smeaton’s 1753/4 paper, unfortunately lacking illustrations, described the construction and operation of and experimentation with Smeaton’s ‘whirling speculum’ or horizontal top, essentially a prototype
gyroscope
or artificial horizon, produced through the use of a spinning top and used for marine navigation. Smeaton’s instrument was based on the earlier work of notable instrument maker George Adams and sea captain John Serson.,In about 1738, George Adams developed an
early artificial horizon
, which used a sextant to measure the angle between the sun and its image on a reflective mercury surface.,A decade later in 1748, Adams described his new sea-quadrant in “
The Description and Use of a New Sea-Quadrant
” which described two “curious” methods of creating an artificial horizon: one using a floating mercury mirror (as described above) and another by means of a whirling speculum.,Meanwhile in 1743, sea captain John Serson developed his own whirling speculum, a spinning top used as a level to locate the horizon in foggy conditions, and is generally credited as the inventor of the whirling speculum as his instrument was most likely constructed and publicised prior to George Adams’ 1748 publication mentioned above. However, Serson was unable to further develop his instrument as he was tragically lost at sea on the HMS Victory in 1744.,In 1751/2, a paper on Serson’s speculum “An account of an horizontal Top, invented by Mr Serson, by Mr James Short, FRS” was read before the Royal Society; a
manuscript transcription
of the paper can be found in the Science Museum archives.,James Short’s brief paper described further development of Serson’s speculum after Serson was lost at sea including Smeaton’s early contributions to understanding the underlying scientific principles and operation of this innovative scientific instrument.,Considered the inventor and constructor of the best air-pump (vacuum pump) Short had seen, Smeaton was asked to investigate whether air was the cause of the horizontality of the spinning Top, Smeaton’s experiments concluded that this was not the case.,In 1751, Smeaton developed and tested an improved whirling speculum for marine navigation, based on the research described in Short’s paper as well as Serson’s earlier work.,Smeaton initially hired a boat on the Serpentine river and later voyaged down to Thames
“several leagues beyond the Nore”
in a small sailing boat. Smeaton went on to further work in this area,
collaborating with Dr Gowin Knight
(1713-1772) in 1750 and 1751 with tests of Smeaton’s improved whirling speculum as well as a mariner’s compass designed and made by the pair.,Sea trails of the two instruments took place during a short cruise of HMS Fortune, a sloop of war, in the same year. The trials revealed that Smeaton’s whirling speculum was not useful and had severe problems with accuracy when used in heavy seas.,Meanwhile, Smeaton’s mariner’s compass, co-developed with Dr Knight, was of sufficient quality to become a Royal Navy standard issue and by 1751 Smeaton moved his instrument business from one part of Holborn, London to another, from Great Turnstile to a larger premises in Furnival Inn Court, and was employing three craftsmen.,Despite his ultimate lack of success with his whirling speculum, Smeaton’s experimental instrument marked a significant development in artificial horizons and can be considered a prototype of sorts for the modern gyroscope.,More generally, Smeaton’s experiments and papers before the Royal Society including his 1753/4 paper on his whirling speculum established his credentials as an instrument maker and researcher of renown and innovation.,By 1753, Smeaton had been made a prestigious Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in recognition of his innovations in marine and scientific instruments as well as his research into the mechanics of waterwheels and windmills.,Between 1753 and 1756, Smeaton further developed his career: acquiring in an interest in mechanics; taking on a series of small civil engineering projects mostly related to bridges and locks; and touring various “hydraulic features” in the Netherlands.,This combination of skills, research, and experience as well as his varied and innovative approach to instrument making and engineering led to Smeaton being recommended by the Royal Society to design and construct the new Eddystone lighthouse in 1756.,Smeaton’s Eddystone lighthouse, the third such lighthouse built over a period of 100 years at the dangerous location of Eddystone Rocks located fourteen miles from Plymouth in the English Channel. Smeaton’s ingeniously designed and constructed lighthouse built between 1755 and 1759 used ‘hydraulic lime’ concrete foundations which cured or dried underwater.,Smeaton’s model of these innovative foundations has been preserved at Leeds Museums and Galleries. Such was the strength of the foundations that when the subsequent fourth and current lighthouse, designed by James Douglass using Robert Stevenson’s developments of Smeaton’s techniques, was constructed on a new site in April 1879, the foundations of Smeaton’s earlier lighthouse, in place for 100 years, were too strong to be removed and so were left
in situ
.,Smeaton is credited with being the first person to use the term ‘civil engineer’ as a title and to differentiate himself from military engineers.,By 1767, such was Smeaton’s reputation and success, founded upon his many successful civil engineering projects including canals, bridges, harbours, and the Eddystone lighthouse, as well as his strong role in, and many papers before, the Royal Society that he was forced to issue a
trade advertising card
shown above outlining his limited availability and consulting costs.,The trade card informed Smeaton’s friends (read customers) that, due to his commitments as a professional civil engineer and his role as
Receiver of the Smelt Mill
at Langley on Tyne belonging to the Royal Hospital Greenwich, he was unable to be consulted by the public without payment.,Such was a measure of his success, reputation, and existing commitments that Smeaton found it necessary to charge for his consultations at the follow levels:,to enter upon no business till he has received such a gratuity for performing it … his lowest fee for a consultation at home, is one guinea; but if sent for, two guineas: and if employed the whole morning or day in London, five guineas.,Encyclopaedia Britannica: John Smeaton,Engineer Biography: John Smeaton,Grace’s Guide: John Smeaton,Smiles, Samuel.

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/protecting-the-brain/,Jon Farrow,Protecting the brain,A new device that might help prevent brain injuries has gone on display at the Museum. ,"At the Museum,Science in the news","brain,medicine","Human brains are pretty amazing. Even though a typical brain accounts for only 2% of a person’s mass, it uses
20% of that person’s energy
. Brains use this energy to form and recall
memories
, make complex
decisions
, take in loads of sensory information and maintain a coherent personality. Even when you’re sleeping, your
brain is hard at work
.,After a close call on my cycle into work last week, I started to wonder how protected my brain really was, even with a helmet.,Modern helmets are
pretty good
at preventing skull damage such as fractures, cuts and scrapes. But a hit to the head can cause your brain to move inside your skull, as the brain has a
jelly-like consistency
and is surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid. If the movement is dramatic enough to make your brain
hit the inside of your skull
, it can cause serious damage, including concussion.,It’s long been known that repeated blows to the head are bad for you, but only recently has a
link been acknowledged
between contact sports such as American football and a degenerative brain disease called
chronic traumatic encephalopathy
(CTE). The disease causes all sorts of symptoms, from dizziness and loss of attention, to forgetfulness, poor judgement and mood swings. The disease was common in boxing, hence the old name: dementia pugilistica, or
punch-drunk syndrome
.,The disease has gained attention recently because of a 2015
film
starring Will Smith that dramatises the discovery of the link between CTE and American football by
Dr Bennet Omalu
. There’s also been a multi-million-dollar
lawsuit
in the USA between players affected by the disease and the US National Football League. But head knocks are nothing new, and some researchers think there’s a compelling case to be made that Henry VIII might have
developed CTE
after falling from his horse.,So how can brain movement be reduced?,It’s a tricky proposition because it happens inside the skull, but American researchers at
Q30 Innovations
think they might have found a solution.,Inspired by the way woodpeckers and bighorn sheep survive repeated blows to the head, they have
designed a collar
that slightly increases the amount of blood in the head. This extra blood acts as a cushion for the brain, and you can see this collar on display in the Science Museum.,I asked Tom Hoey, the CEO of Q30, about why he got involved in the development of the Q-collar, ‘When I saw the early technology I knew I had to get involved. I grew up playing sports and it was hugely important for me. Now that my kids are playing sports, it’s even more important for me that kids can stay active without compromising their safety. We’re one of the first groups to start working on prevention rather than diagnosis and treatment.’,,Protecting the brain has come a long way. Not only are modern helmets much better designed than their older counterparts, but we also have a better understanding of the mechanics and consequences of brain injuries. That said, there’s still a lot we don’t know: at the moment the only way to definitively diagnose CTE is by dissecting a brain after death; research into the safety and effectiveness of the Q-collar is also ongoing.,All this talk of brain injury has made me appreciate how important and fragile my brain is, so I’ll definitely continue to wear a helmet when I cycle. You might also see me sporting a new neck accessory if it becomes commercially available.,If you would like to find out more, the Q-collar will be on display at the Science Museum from 17 May in the
Antenna
gallery for a couple of months."

on Leonardo de Vinci illustrates this vividly. He was an incredible artist AND a brilliant, insatiably curious engineer who ‘
never allowed his knowledge to get in the way of his imagination
’.,Perhaps less well known is that he was an excellent musician and one of the designs in his Codex Atlanticus was of a ‘
viola organista’

built and played
by Polish pianist Slawomir Zubrzycki in 2013.,More evidence, as if we need it, that science is very much part of our culture."

industry initiatives emerge
, the trigger for the biggest public conversations is often when a new science or technology makes the headlines, often when things go wrong.,Few people were interested in infectious proteins called prions until
BSE, or ‘mad cow disease’
(a phrase coined by a colleague of mine at The Daily Telegraph) became a threat to a national herd and then, through
vCJD
, to people.,Louise Brown’s birth
electrified the world to the possibilities of reproductive science, a discussion that was revived again with the birth of Dolly the sheep, mitochondrial transplants and the use of gene editing,
CRISPR
.,Now we are in the throes of an AI revolution.,Never before has there been more need for public engagement with AI, even though the field stretches back many decades.,Algorithms are already making decisions about medical treatments, probation or mortgages as well as running online searches to serve up customised online adverts based on past activity.,Even though we are in the era of ‘narrow AI,’ where algorithms can only outperform us on specific tasks, this has vast potential in diagnosis, personalised medicine, optimising energy use and in transport too, as shown in our exhibition,
Driverless: Who is in Control?
, which was supported by MathWorks, DLG and PwC alongside Samsung – another sign of a keen interest in this field.,We are already entering uncharted waters, from the use of AI to create fake videos, known as
deepfakes
, to the
recent discovery that facial recognition technology can fail to recognise the features of some people with very light or dark skin
or the deep unease about autonomous weapons.,Though ‘narrow AI’ is a far cry from the general AI seen in movies such as Ex Machina, or the sentient killing machines of Terminator, Hollywood does at least help the public understand the broader issues. I once talked to
Michael Crichton
about how scientists challenged the premise of Jurassic Park and he replied that his movie had done far more than them to get the public to discuss genetic technologies. He was correct, and
there are efforts
to harness this approach.,Yet the reality of AI is more nuanced than ‘narrow’ and ‘general’.,Data is power, yes.
But deep learning can easily be fooled
.,Data are worthless without gathering the right kind. For example, we only tend to take snapshots of the state of the human body, when blood pressure and other factors are
subject to circadian rhythms
,
long term changes in gene use
and so on.,There are already examples of how bias has crept into automated systems, for instance in
decision-making software
used by US hospitals.,Big data is best used
with accompanying deep understanding
. But too few students are trained to understand the theory of dynamical systems needed to describe biology, for example. There are also profound
limits to digital computers
for some complex systems.,The good news is that there are many laudable attempts to start a Big Conversation about AI.,The Government has set up the
Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation
, which will look at issues such as how regulators should treat targeted social media advertising if there’s evidence that it fuels unhealthy behaviours, and is
investing in digital skills
.,There is also an
AI Council
under
Tabitha Goldstaub, co-founder of CognitionX
, which aims to overcome barriers of AI adoption in society.,Dame Wendy Hall
, Regius Professor of Computer Science at the University of Southampton and AI Skills Champion, stressed the Council “will seek to improve the understanding of AI across the UK to encourage diversity across the sector.”,The
Ada Lovelace Institute
has a mission to ensure that data and AI work for people and society. UCL, where I hold a visiting professorship, recently launched
AI for People and Planet
at the Science Museum, articulating the belief that the purpose of innovation in the sector will ultimately have a positive impact on the planet. This is a shared focus of the 100 researchers who will work at the UCL Centre for Artificial Intelligence in Holborn, directed by
Prof David Barber.,The museum holds the collections of the environmental scientist
James Lovelock
who,  in his latest book,
Novacene: The Coming Age of Hyperintelligence
,  argues that machines will evolve to outperform us by the end of this century but, reassuringly, will still need humans just as we need plants.,But, as
Geoff Mulgan, CEO of NESTA, has pointed out
, ‘there has been too much talk about interesting but irrelevant future questions, and not enough about harder current ones.’,“Where there has been serious impact on the ethics of AI, it has mainly come from journalism (like the exposure of Cambridge Analytica), activism (like the many moves against autonomous weapons), bureaucrats (like GDPR), or detailed academic analysis of abuses. Not much has been achieved by the professional AI ethicists.”,The Science Museum has played its part in engaging the public with AI, from its
Driverless
exhibition
to
celebrating the life of the father of AI, Alan Turing
, to hosting a conversation about AI between
Brian Cox and Eric Schmidt
, technical advisor of Alphabet Inc, the Government’s
Chief Scientific Advisor
,
Bill Gates and will.i.am
, and by aiding the launch of the
first AI online test of intelligence
.,At an event held at our Driverless
Lates
, Science Museum visitors joined Samsung in a conversation on how AI is shaping our future and was encouraged to question how they felt about AI technology through the eyes of a driverless car in a VR experience.,Recently, I participated in a discussion of public attitudes to AI that included
Minister for Digital, Matt Warman
, Teg Dosanjh, Director of Connected Living for Samsung UK and Ireland, Dr. Bhavagaya Bakshi, GP and co-founder at C the Signs, and
Hannah Fry
, SMG Trustee, AI expert and author of Hello World.,Hannah Fry, Associate Professor in the mathematics of cities at University College London, said: “The changes that are coming are going to affect all of us – for better or worse – and we all deserve a say.”,Minister for Digital, Matt Warman, added: “It is important that the public have faith in the technology so that we can explore its full potential.”,Teg Dosanjh, Director of Connected Living for Samsung UK and Ireland, said: “We, the tech industry as a whole, have not done a good job at making AI understandable to everyday people. People feel disconnected and unable to influence the technology that will shape the way they live in the future. This needs to change if AI is going to become a technology that benefits human beings and helps everyone in society.”,Samsung’s
FAIR future report
, based on the views of 5,250 people, reveals just over half (51%) of all people feel that AI will have a positive impact on society as a whole, with only 16% feeling negative about our future with AI.,Almost four in ten (39%) people feel that AI will hold some form of bias, and this concern was higher (43%) in those who held a closer interest in AI.,Almost half (49%) believe that bias in AI would be unintentional, with a much lower number of people (20%) saying they felt this programming would be done on purpose. Others felt that the AI itself would form biases, with 28% feeling that these could develop on their own.,More than a third (36%) of adults feel they are being left out of the AI conversation currently. It’s even worse for teenagers. They’re feeling pessimistic about their ability to influence how AI is used, with well over half (58%) saying they feel they will have no influence on how the technology develops.,People feel that, as AI is likely to be used to make decisions that have an ethical component, everyone should have a say in how it develops. Over three quarters (76%) of people feel this way. And it is even stronger for those who say they trust technology companies (86%) and those who believe AI will have a positive impact on society (84%).,In short, there are many admiral efforts underway but there is also a pressing need for new ways to engage everyone to help build trust in this remarkable new technology. We all need a say in how AI is applied."

fashion show touched down in the Science Museum in May 2016. Yes, there was glitter and lots of makeup. But there was plenty of high technology too, ranging from bizarre visors to smart fabrics bristling with sensors.,One of the models clutched a bubble that helpfully morphed into a bag. Others glided around on roller blades.,Science Museum staff who metamorphosed into models were dressed by fashion schools from Paris, London, Milan, Copenhagen and Berlin, then trained to sashay down a specially-constructed catwalk for a dedicated
Lates
event.,The effort to propel haute couture into orbit was backed by
Bionic Yarn
, a New York City-based start-up which makes fabric from recycled ocean plastic.,‘It went absolutely amazing. It was a proper show with no holds barred’ said Alex Tapia of Bionic Yarn. ‘It really gave an insight into what the kids are doing in these schools that was absolutely special, using the materials that we provided in a brand new way that I have never seen before. It was innovative and refreshing.’,The show was launched by musician Pharrell Williams, Bionic’s creative director, who shared
his thoughts about space
with the audience which included Gregory Haggquist, Chief Technical Officer and Founder of 37.5,
Christian Lagerwaard
, Fashion Designer, Dame Judith Hackitt, Chair of the Engineering Employers Federation and Ian Blatchford, Director of the Science Museum Group.,After a video welcome by UK ESA astronaut Tim Peake, and a performance by singer and veteran of The Voice Jordan Gray, the MC George Lamb introduced the 30 shortlisted outfits developed by fashion schools across Europe. #CoutureInOrbit trended on Twitter during the night.,Students from

Tim Peake
, in an effort led by Alexa Pollman, senior lecturer.,Caroline Gilbey, Associate Dean for Fashion, said she agreed to take part as soon as Ravensbourne was asked. ‘This provided a unique opportunity for students on four courses and in our business incubator to work together. They all had an amazing time and loved it.’,Cristina Labat at
ESMOD Paris
worked on
couture in orbit
with style professor Katia Mourot, using astronaut Thomas Pesquet as their fashion muse. Labat said that it was a pleasure to welcome representatives from ESA into the school to describe the Agency’s projects. ‘The students were immediately enthralled.’,‘The students selected for London – Maxime, Jamjuree, Ye, Valeria and Nuria – invested a lot of time in this project despite their busy schedule to graduate at the end of the year. The result was wonderful.’,At ESMOD Berlin the
couture in orbit
effort was led by Philippe Ara, design teacher, and lecturer Stephanie Biedermann. Around 20 of their students worked on the project, guided by the inspiration of ESA astronaut, Alexander Gerst: ‘One student started thinking about photosynthesis seen from space and another was inspired by the lack of visible country borders from above to design a garment that eschewed visible borders.’,Prof Ramiro Alvarado of ESMOD Berlin added it was an ‘amazing project…’I told the students I wanted to go to new places and it took us there.’,Lis Fornæs of the
Fashion Design Akademiet Copenhagen
said her students had been fired up by a visit by Danish ESA astronaut
Andreas Mogensen
, who has worked on a special
skinsuit
. ‘We were shown the future path for fashion. And it was fun.’,Prof Annalisa Dominoni of the
Politecnico di Milano

event
sponsored by the Royal Society, Director of External Affairs Roger Highfield interviewed the President of the Society, Nobelist Venki Ramakrishnan.,The ribosome is a complex biological machine that sits at the nexus of history, information, life and health. It is a molecular factory that has toiled in organisms since the dawn of life billions of years ago, one that plays a central role in all living things and one that, according to Venki Ramakrishnan, could provide the key to combating the global scourge of antibiotic resistance.,Venki is a leading light among those who have been unravelling the secrets of this vast chemical machine. His team at the Medical Research Council’s
Laboratory of Molecular Biology
in Cambridge has uncovered key details of this protein-making factory, life’s oldest and most universal assembly of molecules, paving the way for his 2009 Nobel Prize in chemistry.,The ribosome needs various ingredients to turn genes into flesh and blood: a messenger RNA molecule, which carries the instructions for making a protein from the cellular storehouse of genetic information, held in the form of DNA. To turn this messenger RNA code into protein, the ribosome harnesses a second type of RNA – transfer RNA – which carries the building blocks of proteins, called amino acids.,Like a tape reader, the ribosome reads messenger RNA, a sequence of four “letters” (chemicals, called bases) that spells out the recipe of a protein. The chemical machinery in the ribosome takes this sequence, three letters at a time, and matches it to three letters on each transfer RNA, lining up their cargo of amino acids in the proper order, then stitches them together to build the protein.,Venki (though he has been knighted, he prefers not to be called Sir Venki) told me how his team competed to find the rhyme and reason of the ribosome against Ada Yonath, who had invested decades in cracking this problem, and Thomas Steitz of Yale University. The competition, which went on to include a fourth group in Santa Cruz, was ‘stressful’, he admitted, as it became clear that this high-risk project could blight the careers of young researchers who worked with him if it did not deliver.,They used intense, tuned sources of X-rays from a machine called a synchrotron to interrogate the structure, revealing the location of every last atom. Such studies show how the ribosome is composed of three different RNA molecules and more than 50 different proteins, arranged in two components called the 30S and the 50S subunits. The former is the ‘brain’ that reads genetic code and the latter the larger ‘heart’ that makes protein. They drift apart and together, as molecular links are forged and broken, to create the proteins that build and run the body.,Overall, the ribosome ratchets RNAs laden with amino acids through its heart at a rate of 15 per second to string them together into proteins. ‘The surprise was how a machine of this size was so precise,’ he said, while showing the Hay audience a video of this soft, deformable micro machine in action.,This is a remarkable recapitulation of the idea of the body as a machine, an ideas that was first glimpsed centuries ago, as revealed by the Science Museum’s
Leonardo exhibition
, and in an exhibition about
humanoid robots
which will open next year.,Venki told me how new understanding of this marvellous machine could help tackle superbugs that are evolving resistance to antibiotics. ‘It is potentially a huge problem and if we don’t act on it, it will become a major crisis.’,The ribosome is a big target, relatively speaking, consisting of around half a million atoms and measuring around one millionth of an inch across. The thousands at work in every one of our cells have been honed over aeons.,Studies, which
date back many years
, have shown which parts are best targeted by antibiotics. Peer deep inside the ribosome and, like the rings in the trunk of a tree, you can see an ancient core that has been turning instructions into the proteins for the best part of four billion years. This is ‘where all the action happens’, said Venki.,This chemical contraption lies at the heart of between two eras of life, one familiar and one shrouded in mystery: the former consists of today’s DNA-based living things and the latter the very first things that multiplied which did not rely on DNA at all.,This core is an artefact of this earlier era of evolution, when a different kind of life thrived on Earth. It consists of the genetic material RNA, a relic of the so-called ‘RNA world,’ when living things depended on this more delicate-yet-flexible kind of genetic material which not only stores information but, unlike DNA, can catalyse chemical reactions too. Finding this RNA in a ribosome is a bit like discovering a floppy disk, perhaps even a punched card, in a tablet computer.,When you compare this relic molecular machinery in myriad organisms, you make a startling discovery. ‘The closer you get to the heart of the ribosome, the more similar,’ says Venki: this ancient RNA is so essential to the process of staying alive that it is almost identical, whatever the creature.,Whether it belongs to a bacterium or a person, the RNA at the heart of ribosome ceaselessly turns genetic instructions into the protein molecules that build and run a body.,A rind of proteins evolved around this central RNA machinery to hone its performance and this differs depending on the creature – our ribosomes are almost twice as large as those of the bugs that infect us, for example. It turns out that some antibiotics work by, in effect, throwing a spanner in the works of this machine, targeting bacterial ribosomes while leaving human ribosomes intact so they do not cause side effects. ‘They bind to bacterial ribosomes, not so well to ours,’ he explained.,Thanks to this work, deeper insights are emerging that could pave the way to new classes of antibiotics. He told the Hay audience how these are desperately needed as resistance to conventional antibiotics takes hold, though he emphasized (as has the Chief Medical Officer
Dame Sally Davies
) that new drugs are not the whole answer – they must be accompanied by a multifaceted approach, from new diagnostics to regulating their use, not least in agriculture.,Many antibiotics such as tetracycline and streptomycin work by disrupting the conglomerates of RNA and protein in the ribosome. Venki has investigated how they do this, not least to understand how they fail. For example, some bacteria shatter antibiotic drugs into pieces (this is the cause of penicillin resistance), others add chemical groups to the ribosome, changing the target; mutate to alter the fundamental shape of the ribosome; or expel the antibiotic with molecular pumps. ‘Eventually, resistance will occur and this is simply a consequence of the fact that bacteria mutate and resistance can be selected for,’ he explained.,This provides understanding to develop new antibiotics. Tom Steitz has, for example, started a company that has developed several lead compounds that show promise. But it is a slog turning lead compounds into treatments. Venki said that drug companies have difficulty recouping the billion dollar investment when the latest antibiotics have to be reserved for the most resistant infections and, overall, are not as profitable as medications that have to be swallowed day in, day out. There should be better market mechanisms, though he added that Governments also play a key role.,The path to his Nobel Prize began with his upbringing in India, where his parents taught him that science ‘is an interesting life.’ After an unpromising start at school, notably when his parents ‘gave up on me’ between his seventh and ninth grades, a teacher helped kindle his interest in science and mathematics.,Venki went on to study for a doctorate in physics in Ohio. However, this turned out to be a false start (‘I realised that, actually, I was much more interested in biology’). Being relatively young, he decided to start again in graduate school: ‘I had to go backwards several years.’ Eventually, after gaining a doctorate in biology, he joked how he was lured from America by the ‘food, salary and weather’ to the LMB in Cambridge, where, most famously, Jim Watson and Francis Crick discovered the
double helix
structure of DNA.,While he had worked on parts of the ribosome in the United States, the LMB allowed him to study the molecular machine in its head-spinning entirety. ‘I had no idea how long that would take.’ The lab ‘focuses on long term challenges’ and, when it comes to its
ten Nobel prizes
, they ‘are simply a fringe benefit’ of its commitment to pure curiosity. At that time, Venki had not even managed to make crystals of ribosomes, a critical first step to study them with X rays. ‘I just had an idea and some hope.’,Roger Highfield
interviewed Andre Geim
last year at the Hay Festival about his work on graphene which also paved the way to a Nobel prize. An exhibition,

June 28, 2016,,We have all sorts of different kinds of robots, built from recycled electronics and junk from an eclectic mix of donors including the Women’s Institute, the National Trust and the Manchester Transport Network. Each group is making their own robot to play a particular part. The orchestra will consist of ‘electronic brains’ which create music by playing real instruments including violins, glockenspiels and xylophones, as well as redundant technology like floppy disk drives and old desk fans, which can make their own sounds.,This is the first Citizen Science project of its kind, reusing discarded machines and technology. It is a much more ambitious version of the pilot version that we assembled for my
2014 Royal Institution Christmas Lecture
How to hack your home
, which was broadcast on BBC Four. After its Manchester debut, we plan to take it on tour across the country, with the support of the Royal Academy of Engineering.,At our Hack Day a few weeks ago almost 200 primary and secondary school children came to the Great Hall at the University’s Sackville Street Building, where partner organisations and supporters such as Apple, The Hive, Noisy Toys and FabLab led workshops to build music-making robots. Around 20 robots were created, including a series of percussive devices such as a drum made from Pringles cardboard tubes, plus various tambourines and bells.,Our friends at the engineering company Siemens are building a special robot conductor to keep the other robots to time. It’s called ‘Graphene’, as it’s a good conductor!  At the Hack Day, Adam Holmes from Siemens made a presentation to the children and teachers to show the engineering behind the robot and how it plans to keep all the other robots in time.,We are also working closely with the Hallé Orchestra, which is so exciting. Steve Pickett, Education Director at the Hallé, has composed a special piece of music for the orchestra launch and will provide eight professional musicians to perform live alongside the robots. Steve revealed the music at the Hack Day where we were all amazed and intrigued as to how we’ll get our robots to play such a wonderful piece of music!,Robotics is very topical right now, with the first
UK Robotics Week
currently underway (from 25 June) and the Science Museum preparing a fantastic new
Robots exhibition
for 2017. The robot orchestra will help us to showcase the ingenuity, creativity and revolutionary spirit of the people of Manchester, and enable us to explore how a city can re-engineer its old ‘stuff’ and spread environmentally responsible good practice through music and performance.,We want to showcase everyone’s work – from five-year-old primary school children working together to the 75-year-old tinkering in their garage – and to celebrate the fantastic failures that allow us to develop our skills and creativity. I’d love this project to get more people tinkering and making, and for them to think about where being involved in such a crazy project can take them. I also hope that it will make children realise that they don’t have to choose the arts OR science – they can do both – it’s called engineering! Everyone can discover the secret engineer inside themselves – and build an amazing machine from their imagination.,If people have lots of fun doing engineering then I’d also like them to recognise that they could use their skills to solve some of the big global challenges we all face. It’s my ambition that this project start some people on that journey.,On 23 June, Professor George was awarded the 2016 Royal Academy of Engineering Rooke Award for public promotion of engineering for her work.

by the Longitude Prize, reports Roger Highfield, Director of External Affairs and member of the
Longitude Committee
.,Games are not only fun but instructive too. The Science Museum has known this for decades, having launched online educational games that have been enjoyed by millions of people over the past 30 years.,Now
Nesta
, the UK’s innovation foundation, is unveiling a new game,
Superbugs
, which highlights the
catastrophic threat facing hospitals worldwide
caused by the rise of antibiotic resistance, subject of the new
Longitude Prize
, a five year, £10 million challenge to develop a test to help guide doctors and reduce the unnecessary use of antibiotics.,Nesta, which has
organised conferences
to discuss the educational value of games, has worked with the BAFTA-winning applied games studio, Preloaded, to come up with a mobile app based game that’s not only fun to play but is scientifically sound.,In the game, players have to stamp out outbreaks of bacteria, but as in real life, they quickly evolve to become resistant. What the game reveals is the challenge of developing new antibiotics to remain one step ahead of resistance, offering players insights along the way. It has already picked up a Serious Play award.,Tamar Ghosh, spokesperson for the Longitude Prize said: “We know that our daily behaviours – like sharing and overusing antibiotics – can lead to bacteria becoming drug-resistant, so it’s really important that we increase awareness. It’s especially important to reach young people and games like this are a fantastic way of doing just that.”,At the Science Museum, we have shown that
educational games
can reach audiences that are both big and young too.,“We often use then to teach or communicate sometimes complex science and technology in a playful and familiar way – it’s what we call stealth learning,” said Dave Patten, Head of New Media, who first helped develop a ‘Design a Rocket’ game for the Space Gallery when he joined the Science Museum in 1985.,The museum has also worked with Preloaded, notably on
Rugged Rovers
, developed for our
Engineer your Future
exhibition, and aimed to get teenagers to embrace their problem-solving skills and ingenuity to explore what it means to be a great engineer.,In the game, players are presented with an engine and invited to draw a body of any shape, add wheels of any size, then have to launch their rover into a rugged terrain of pits and cliff drops. Gallery visitors see their creations racing against one another in real time on a huge screen, while online players compete via the website.,Within three months over 1,000,000 rovers were drawn by players from all around the world. The installation was so successful a touring edition was commissioned to debut at the Big Bang Fair in March 2015 and a version has been installed at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia.,We have a long and distinguished history of developing educational games for our visitors since Design a Rocket. Perhaps the most notable of these at the Science Museum, explains Patten, is the design a T-shirt game in

Who Am I? gallery
, I hope to get the public to comment on the piece. I think it is easy to see genetic screening as just “scientific progress” but we don’t take the time to consider that we are not only screening out a genetic condition, we are screening out the person with that condition.,I have a very full life, work full time, am married and am lucky to have a rich and diverse social life with friends and family.  Many people are not lucky enough to have these things even if they don’t have a genetic illness. Also I feel my disability is part of my identity, it’s taught me resilience, creative problem solving and the ability to communicate with diverse people. I wouldn’t change that.,I realise that not everyone with a genetic condition may feel the same as me or experience things in the same way. But I’m asking for all of us to take time to consider the wide ranging implications that pre-natal genetic screening would have if it were more widely available. I think it would change our society irrevocably.,I have been interested for many years as to how art can get the public discussing what’s happening around complex ethical issues. Until now I had predominantly been a painter, but in order to express my current thoughts on genetic screening, I wanted to make a piece of sculpture “Pandora’s Box”.,A lead casket is embossed with the ancient Greek Hippocratic Oath. This reminds us of a time when physicians were not only concerned with the physical body but were also philosophers. Pandora’s Box invites us to take time to decipher the text and ponder on it’s meaning as to the value of life.,I’m asking the viewer to reconsider the connection between our medical body and our spiritual essence and what it means to be human. The casket is gilded on the inside with gold leaf, symbolising inner beauty and knowledge. Emerging from the casket is a double helix style twist made from computer punch tape, symbolising the early era of collecting and storing data. Have we now reduced ourselves to a code?,Hanging above the casket are strips of velum. This is calf skin manuscript which has been used over many centuries, for valuable documents such as the Magna Carta. It’s an ancient medium and I chose this material to emboss with excerpts from a study that looked at how people felt about prenatal genetic screening.,I have been working in collaboration with Felicity Boardman, the study’s author, to look at the statements taken from people affected by the genetic condition Spinal Muscular Atrophy. Felicity has been undertaking
research
into the way experiential knowledge of disability may affect decision making in pre-natal screening. I wanted to produce a piece that represented multiple voices who had taken part in the study.,I believe art has the power to allow thoughtful contemplation as well as express complex emotional subject matter. Has this piece made you think more deeply about the topic? Share your thoughts on Twitter with #geneticscreening.,‘Pandora’s Box’ is on display in the Who Am I? gallery until September 2016.

Assistant Curator of Medicine Jack Mitchell explains more. ,"Collections and Objects,Science in the news",medicine,"During this first week of the
Rio 2016 Olympics
, there has been a lot of talk about the mysterious red circles that have appeared on the skin of a couple of prominent athletes. The most notable of these individuals is the most successful Olympian of all time, the American swimming sensation
Michael Phelps
.,Despite some initial confusion amongst armchair Olympic fans, the source of these marks was ultimately identified-not as love bites but as stemming from the ancient therapeutic practice of cupping.,Thanks @arschmitty for my cupping today!!! #mpswim #mp ? @chasekalisz,A photo posted by Michael Phelps (@m_phelps00) on
Sep 10, 2015 at 12:29pm PDT,,Cupping involves placing bowl like vessels onto the body, which, through the creation of a vacuum, suck and pull the skin. The vacuum within the vessel is traditionally created by heating the cup with a flame; however other methods can extract the air with a pump.,“Dry” cupping relies only on the heating of the cup, whereas “wet” cupping scarifies the skin prior to treatment and draws blood out of the body.,A side effect of the treatment is the red circular discs that can
clearly be seen
on Phelps’ body.,The fact that most people were baffled by these circular marks indicates that cupping is situated at the very fringes of modern, western, medical therapeutics.,However, it wasn’t always this way.,A brief look through
the collection of the Science Museum
reveals a vast array of cupping equipment, which demonstrates very strongly that cupping once occupied a much more central role in both treating and understanding the human body.,This 2,000 years old bronze cupping vessel was excavated from Pompeii, Italy. During this period cupping would have been used as a treatment method for a variety of different ailments, including coughs and colds.,The
humour
theory dominated contemporary understandings of the body and health, and as such cupping was used as a way of drawing excess or imbalanced humours to the surface of the skin and away from the body.,Cupping sets, such as the above example from nineteenth century England, are common within the museum’s collection. Cupping formed a central part of the early nineteenth century therapeutic landscape and its use would’ve been very familiar to people of the time. It was used as a form of
bloodletting
to combat a wide range of diseases and illnesses, and as a procedure it would have changed very little from ancient times. As the century progressed, cupping’s prominent role within western medicine did begin to wane; as such it was increasingly pushed towards the fringes of popular and acceptable practice.,Nowadays, the most common and consistent exposure to cupping treatment comes at the hands of a Complimentary and Alternative Medicine (
CAM
) practitioner. Working outside of mainstream healthcare, these practitioners offer a more holistic approach to understandings of health and the body. Within the UK the most common form of CAM practice is Traditional Chinese Medicine (
TCM
), of which cupping forms an integral part.,This dry cupping machine was used by a UK based TCM practitioner. Its use of an electrical motor demonstrates how an ancient practice has been continued and adapted for the modern world.,Unlike his nineteenth century predecessors, Michael Phelps does not use cupping as a method for combatting illness and disease. Rather, the location of the circles on his shoulders illustrates how he uses cupping to relive pain and repair the muscles in the most over worked part of his body.,Despite having a high profile advocate in Phelps the practice is not without its critics.,Many criticise cupping for having no measurable, evidence based benefit to the human body- rendering it little better than a placebo. Subsequently, the practice has not been commonplace in Western biomedicine since the start of the 1900’s. Those who do support cupping point to its 3,000 year heritage and its continued positive impact upon muscle pain and general well-being. Happily for them they can now also point to 21 (

Nah I would say Kitt from Knight Rider.,And if you could design a robot to do one mundane task for you, what would it do?,My Edinburgh show. Mind you I am trying to do a show with heart this year so maybe to floss my teeth.,Part of our upcoming quiz night will see you race against robots to perform tasks that they are specifically designed to do. How do you rate your chances?,Low. Very low.,Let’s stay optimistic here! How are you with tech in general? Do you keep up to date with the latest tech and gadgets?,I ask my younger friends to explain them to me. Then I forget what they’ve said.,So if owning a robot became the next big thing would you be first in line to get one or stay at home with a cup of tea?,Probably the tea option. I remember telling my boyfriend that mobile telephones wouldn’t catch on.,Ah, I see. Well, what are your predictions for where robotic technology will be in 10 years’ time then?,I think WW3 will have wiped out the robots.,What about the future of your career, are you worried now robots can make jokes too?,Hey if Brexit and America have taught us anything, I wanna say that I think we can work alongside them and all learn from each other. If not I can cut their wires.,Alright then, tell us your best robot joke…,What do you call a Southern African Dictator Robot?  Robot Mugabe.,Apologies I mean I just made that up on the spot.,See Lou Sanders at the first in our series of after-hours

Researchers are aiming to build systems that learn and adapt from experience, to reduce the need for human programmers to laboriously develop bespoke code for each new application of a program.,One of the key engineering challenges is to find effective ways to draw together the vast quantities of data embedded in the internet so that machines can learn to explore and exploit information – an issue raised in a recent IET/Royal Academy of Engineering report
Connecting Data
.,Breaking the code,As the world transitions to storing information in digital form, subject to digital control systems, there is more demand for programs that can automate repetitive tasks. One issue is checking for mistakes in code, to which engineers like Professor Dino Distefano have an answer. Co-founder and CEO of Monoidics and Software Engineer for Facebook, he will tell an audience at
Ingenia Live
(an event held by the Royal Academy of Engineering’s
Ingenia
magazine) how he uses a static analyser to verify code, but using advanced logic that can keep up with the latest developments. The same event will see Dr Marily Nika, Engineering Program Manager at Google, explain the impact coding technology is having on our lives, and how close we are to real-life computing approaching the capabilities seen in science fiction. Dr Danny Tarlow of the Machine Intelligence and Perception group at Microsoft Research will look at recent research that aims to make everyone a programmer, even without them realising it!,Gaming a solution,Earlier this year, the British company DeepMind made headlines around the world with AlphaGo, the first computer program ever to beat the world’s top professional player – Lee Sedol – at the fiendishly complicated game of Go. With more board configurations than there are atoms in the Universe, this ancient Chinese game cannot be solved simply by using brute force algorithms that try out millions of options to determine their next move. Instead, AlphaGo uses deep neural networks to mimic expert human players, and further improves its own performance by learning from games played against itself.,DeepMind founder Dr Demis Hassabis spoke last month about his work, and its implications for the future of AI, at the Royal Academy of Engineering. The event was introduced by Roger Highfield of the Science Museum, and is available to watch

.,Copying the human brain,The
Human Brain Project
is a ten-year European Commission-funded flagship programme that aims to put in place a cutting-edge, ICT-based scientific Research Infrastructure for brain research, cognitive neuroscience and brain-inspired computing. With 116 partner universities and organisations across Europe, it aims to accelerate scientific understanding of the human brain, make advances in defining and diagnosing brain disorders, and develop new brain-like technologies.,For example, Manchester University’s contribution to the project, led by Professor Steve Furber FREng, ICL Professor of Computer Engineering at the University of Manchester, is
SpiNNaker
(Spiking Neural Network Architecture), a computing platform made up of 500,000 microprocessors which emulates the way brain neurons fire signals in real time. SpiNNaker can be used to accurately model areas of the brain, and to test new hypotheses about how the brain might work. Because it runs at the same speed as the biological brain, it can be used to control robotic systems, providing ‘embodiment’ for the brain models. This biological approach to robot control is very different from the algorithmic systems more commonly used in robotics.,Last week saw the launch of
Compbiomed
at University College London, an EU project which aims to use high performance computing for modelling in biology to

– Robin,“Everyone is very enthusiastic and we are all doing lots of research so it is really interesting when we get back together at the next meeting to discuss what we have found out.  I loved the presentation from Kristin Hibbs on design aspects because it suddenly made the whole ethos of the exhibition come alive. “
– Jenny,“What turns out to have been the most enthralling aspect has been the opportunity of that insight, albeit small, into the actual process of setting-up an exhibition such as this: all the time and effort given by a bevy of specialists in love with their art, into all the myriad of details and things to think about that would never generally cross the mind of the average member of the general exhibition-going public. What a privilege!”

Do other habitable planets exist? Where will we go when Earth can no longer support us? Age-old questions like these continue to drive our desire for deep space travel. But if we’re to venture far beyond the planets in our solar system, we need a new method of travel. Our closest star system, Alpha Centauri, is 4.37 light years away. If it were possible to use current fuel-based space shuttles to get there, which it’s not, we’d be looking at a journey time of about 165,000 years. Even if we took advantage of gravitational pull to slingshot a craft in its general direction, the same technique that sent
Voyager-1
into interstellar space, you’d still be left with an eta of many thousands of years and would have to pass the Sun to get the top speed needed.,,That’s why solar sails are being touted as the future of space exploration. This lightweight, completely fuel-free system enables spacecrafts to be ‘pushed’ through space thanks to the momentum that photons of light transfer when they bounce off its highly reflective sails. As long as there’s a continuous source of light, the craft can be continuously ‘pushed’ forward, faster and faster.,Leading this field is
The Planetary Society
with their crowd-funded solar sailing satellite, LightSail™. Folded up to the size of a loaf of bread, the LightSail cubesat needs to hitch a ride to space aboard a rocket. But once released, about 720km above Earth, it can unfurl its 32m2 sails and start its journey.,The
non-profit organisation
has been talking about solar sails for over 40 years, but it wasn’t until 2000 that work on the idea began.,In 2015 though, the team’s hard work paid off when LightSail successfully flew in a deployment test. With this great achievement under their belt and a replica model of the LightSail satellite now on display in our interactive Antenna gallery, Bill Nye, Planetary Society CEO and American science educator, gave us a quick update on what’s to come when he came to visit:,‘We’re planning on launching LightSail-2 as soon as we can, hopefully as early as autumn 2017. The satellite is built and ready to go, we just have to wait for the new rocket to be ready. We are excited to be aboard a SpaceX Falcon Heavy!’ Bill Nye.,According to experts, a solar sail craft could make the trip to Alpha Centauri in just 20 years, which is why it’s now the focus of project
Breakthrough Starshot
whose ambition it is to do exactly that. Relying on solar rays alone, it would take a month for LightSail to reach the same speed as a jet airliner. But with enough time and light exposure, it’s hoped solar sails could be propelled to 15-20% of light speed, faster than any spacecraft that currently exists. At some point, when it got too far from the Sun, LightSail would stop accelerating, but without enough gravity to slow it down it would continue to travel at its top speed indefinitely.,The LightSail model will be on display in our interactive Antenna gallery until mid-April 2017. Visit our

Simon, an Explainer at the Museum, reflects on working in previous incarnations of the gallery.","At the Museum,Exhibitions and Galleries,Families","explainers,interactive galleries","As the Science Museum prepares to begin building an ambitious new
Interactive gallery
, we wave a fond farewell to Launchpad. Simon, an Explainer at the Museum, reflects on working in the gallery.,“Wow! It’s toy heaven!” It was 1987 and a boy of about eight years old had just stepped into the Science Museum’s one year old interactive gallery, Launchpad. It’s hard to exaggerate just how new and different Launchpad was to most museum visitors when it opened.,When I spoke to school groups in those days I would ask, “What is the first thing that comes to mind when you think of museums?” The answer every time was ‘Do not touch’. Now here was a place where the whole point was to touch, to explore, to build, to play! The idea was not so much to tick check boxes of specific facts and concepts, but to inspire through participation. That atmosphere of joyous, frenetic investigation has continued to this day.,Launchpad has moved several times since its first home in 1986 on the ground floor (where the shop is now). I have often found that visitors think of the incarnation of the gallery that they visited as children as ‘their own’ Launchpad.,In 1989 the gallery moved to the first floor with several new exhibits and a dedicated space for science shows. Those with long memories might recall having seen shows about light, inventions and making paper at home.,In 2000 the Science Museum opened the Wellcome Wing with its
IMAX cinema
, several new galleries and a new location for Launchpad in the basement. This space had an enclosed science show area and a smaller show area where younger visitors enjoyed storytelling sessions of ‘
the enormous turnip
’ and ‘the three pigs’ (with a rather scary wolf). Demonstrations were also held of a system called Optimusic that triggers sounds using light.,Launchpad
went through a major overhaul when it moved to its current location in 2007. There was a new look, many new exhibits and new versions of old favourites. The gallery also features the
Water Rocket demonstration
where pressurised water and air is shot out of a plastic bottle, propelling it at 60km/hr along a track. As well as hourly science shows, there are small demonstrations about sound, light, materials and heat.,In September 2008, Launchpad celebrated the arrival of its one millionth visitor. There is a plaque of Alyaa and her brother Maxi’s handprints on the wall of the gallery. I find it hard not to think of the many young people who have had their passion for science awakened by classic exhibits like the Plasma Ball, the Grain Pit, the Sound Dishes, Grab the Bling and Watch Water Freeze.,One young woman, who was on a nostalgic trip to see the exhibits she used to play with when she was a child, told me that she studied physics at university because of Launchpad. What could be better than that?,Launchpad will close on Sunday 1 November 2015, with the new
Interactive gallery
opening in late 2016. The new gallery will be 60 percent bigger than Launchpad and packed with state-of-the-art interactive exhibits: You can walk through a giant orrery with a canopy of stars above it, take part in live chemistry experiments at a chemistry bar or whizz down the friction slide.,While we build the new gallery, our
Garden
and
Pattern Pod
interactive galleries will be open as usual and there will be regular free science shows, events for schools and hands-on activities throughout the Museum. Many of Launchpad’s exhibits will
find new homes
in schools and science centres across the UK and in South Africa."

traces the impact of early scientific experiments on the history of photography and showcases the innovative scientists and artists who strived to see the world anew.,Early pioneers like Alan Archibald Campbell-Swinton and
Eadweard Muybridge
were driven by a desire to reveal the invisible processes and structures of our physical world. This desire is still with us and today there are countless magazines, websites and blogs dedicated to sharing photographic experiments – both dark room and digital – but has the popularisation of these once revolutionary photographic techniques – x-rays, high-speed photography photomicrography etc. – diminished the ‘revelatory’ impact they once had? After all, a revelation only happens once.,The development of technology over the last 100 years has made photography popular and accessible. Almost all of us carry a relatively high quality camera with us on our phones these days, and digital reproduction has expanded the audience for photographic experiments.,Bernice Abbott’s now iconic MIT photographs became widely known as illustrations in physics textbooks but today blogging and photo-sharing websites like Flickr and
Instagram
foster a much wider, international audience for photographic experimentation.,Harold Edgerton’s early experiments helped to popularise the stroboscope; a once obscure laboratory device for photographing objects at high speed; and now slow motion photography is part of our everyday visual language.,Ubiquitous on advertising billboards and in music videos, slow motion imaging is also an internet phenomenon; the
Slow Mo Guys
, a Youtube channel dedicated to capturing high-speed processes like exploding watermelons and bursting balloons, have 5.5 million subscribers and over 500 million views.,Thanks to pioneers such as Edgerton and
Étienne Jules Marey
, many of the photographic techniques featured in
Revelations
have become a familiar part of our visual culture, but we shouldn’t forget how astounding these techniques once were.,The story goes that when French film pioneers the Lumière brothers first screened their film
Train Pulling Into a Station
in 1895, audiences jumped out of their seats for fear of their lives. Early films like this one had a frightening effect on people because of their novelty – it was unlike anything they had experienced before.,A hundred and twenty years of cinema history later and we have become very used the medium of film, so that a sequence of a train pulling into a station is unlikely to carry the same impact (although more recent advances in 3D technology and motion simulation as featured in the Science Museum’s
IMAX
and Discovery Motion Theatre might come closer to simulating the original shock of the Lumière brothers’ film!).,The innovative photographic techniques displayed in
Revelations
may have lost their novelty but viewing these photographs today it is hard to deny how striking and effective they still are as images.,Why is this?,Certainly it helps that the exhibition frames them in terms of their historical significance, which makes their innovative aspect clear. The remarkable aesthetic quality of these early photographs is also important to consider, and this is especially evident when you see them alongside art photography (the great originality of this exhibition).,The
photographs taken by Edgerton
during his time at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology demonstrate a visual sensibility in their complementary pastel backgrounds and
Alfred Ehrhardt
and Carl Strüwe’s photomicrographs show an interest in the ‘abstract beauty’ of microstructures.,No doubt the experiments in photography being carried out today and shared online to vast audiences will soon lose their initial ‘novelty’ impact. Whether their value as striking and ‘revelatory’ images will last, however, is a question for future generations.,,Adam Stoneman is an Explainer at the Science Museum.,Revelations: Experiments in Photography

.,This central question deserves some thought and, hopefully, subsequent action. It arises out of the little known but factual claim that future asteroid impacts can be both predicted and prevented, saving lives and property, provided that we, collectively, employ readily available technology to establish this capability.,But who is the “we” in this statement? “Aye, there’s the rub” as Hamlet bemoans in his soliloquy “To be, or not to be…?” There are two very important “we”s involved which are especially relevant in regard to
Asteroid Day
; the world public, and world governments.,Planetary defense, the prevention or mitigation of asteroid impacts, is public safety writ large.  Millions of asteroids have impacted Earth in its 4.5 billion year history both enabling and shaping life on the planet. The vast majority have been (relatively speaking) small, equivalent to no more than a typical hydrogen bomb or two. But a few have been in the 100 million hydrogen bomb energy category, destroying much of life on the planet virtually instantaneously. This 4.5 billion year old threat continues unimpeded today.,This film,
51 Degrees North
, will be screened as part of Asteroid Day at the Science Museum.,What has changed dramatically is that we humans now have the capability to terminate this ongoing process. Yet, generally speaking, it is governments who ultimately have the responsibility for public safety and who must act. But without public recognition and insistence that they shoulder planetary defense responsibility governments will continue to avoid accountability.,While geopolitical coordinating and real politik is challenging, the cost of developing and establishing a planetary defense capability is surprisingly inexpensive. In a formal NASA report it was estimated that developing the initial capability would require only about 1.4% of NASA’s budget for the first 10 years and thereafter approximately 0.4% of it’s budget for maintenance. This is an amazingly small cost for so huge a survival benefit!,Nevertheless until the world public demands that this capability and coordination be developed it will not happen. There is no scientific community to lobby for this… it is not science. There is no industrial complex calling for this… there are no mega-contracts to be issued. We’re talking long-term human survival here… future generations… our children and grandchildren for generations to come.,Asteroid Day is the first attempt to marshal widespread public support for this global issue. Of highest priority is substantially increasing the discovery rate of potentially threatening asteroids. We can technically increase this rate of discovery by 100 fold. What is needed for governments to commit to this is your signature on the
Asteroid Day 100x Declaration
.,So please, attend the
Asteroid day event
at the Science Museum on 30 June 2015 (or for your closest event, see

LATES
evening at the museum,
this mysterious object
was taken out from permanent storage and presented to members of the public during our regular object handling, “Hidden Gems” event. We asked if anyone knew what the item was and (perhaps unsurprisingly) no-one correctly identified what it was used for, with guesses ranging from a beverage cup holder through to a piece of machinery!,Although initially enigmatic, this object does in fact contain a fantastic back story of bravery, strength in adversity and even a little bit of sporting prowess…,The object was made by
Steeper
, a company still in existence today and based in Leeds, England. It was made for, and used by, the distinguished Royal Air Force pilot Sir Augustus ‘Gus’ Walker, a man who rose to the highest military ranks by becoming Air Chief Marshal of the RAF and Deputy Commander-In-Chief of NATO forces in Europe. This would, of course, be a tremendous achievement for any individual; however, Walker’s accomplishments are made all the more remarkable by the fact that in 1942 he lost his right arm below the elbow in an airfield accident.,Walker was not flying an aircraft at the time of the incident, but was in the control tower when he noticed that a Lancaster bomber was on fire whilst taxiing across the runway in readiness for a mission. He hurried out to warn the pilots, but was caught in the subsequent explosion.,Rumour has it that upon leaving the airfield in an ambulance he instructed the doctor to telephone RAF high command and ask if they would welcome back a one armed officer in 2 months’ time. True to his word he was back to work inside 2 months and flying aeroplanes again soon after that!,This object
, as Walker’s own unique prosthetic limb attachment, was subsequently made so that he could continue to fly aircraft despite having lost half of one arm. He connected the attachment to the end of this prosthetic arm, tied the leather strap around the joystick and controlled the aircraft with his left hand.,Walker never let his prosthetic limb limit him, and throughout his RAF career he continued to fly new generations of aircraft including the Canberra and Vulcan jet bombers.,As well as being an excellent military man, Walker was also blessed with enviable sporting talents. He was captain of the RAF rugby team and in 1939 earned two full caps for the England team in matches against Ireland and Wales. Walker’s story emphasises the strong historical links that exist between the military and rugby union; a connection that continues to the present
day
.,Walker even rose to the highest administrative ranks of his chosen sport, as between 1965 and 1966 he had a spell as president of the Rugby Football Union (RFU).,Many who met and served with Walker described him as an exceptional serviceman, strong leader and a true gentleman. The high esteem in which he was held has not diminished, as in 2006 a blue plaque was erected in Walker’s honour by a local historical society at his former family home in Garforth, West Yorkshire.,Upon his death in 1987 it was commented that the RAF would never see the like of Walker again, and although his custom made prosthetic is initially mysterious to those who encounter it, it is in fact wonderfully emblematic of a truly unique and remarkable individual."
https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/take-off-take-your-bike-and-take-the-train/,David Rooney,"Take Off, Take Your Bike, And Take The Train",,Collections and Objects,transport,"Last time, I talked about early cycling, and today’s attempts to recreate the glamour of the past. Most of the time, though, cycling is just a practical, cheap and straightforward way to get around.,What makes it more flexible is the ability to mix modes – to combine cycling with rail travel, car or boat.
Jimmy Savile
made the point usefully in this 1982 BR poster:,That family looks like it’s off on holiday, but commuters can benefit from
mixed-mode journeys
too, and this is where the folding bike comes in very handy (as most commuter trains don’t allow full-sized bikes at peak times).,The
Folding Society
is a great source of information for anyone thinking of buying a folder, as there are many excellent examples available. One popular make is
Brompton
, whose work we have
on show at the museum
.,Last week, I took a look round
Brompton’s west-London factory
. Its location rather reinforces my point about mixed-mode journeys, hemmed in as it is by the M4 elevated motorway and a triangle of roads and railway lines.,Inside, the factory is a hive of activity as the bespoke cycles are manufactured, assembled, tested and shipped.,Outside, I returned to the
nearby Underground station
and made my way back to work. Cities are great places for getting around, and the beauty is in the flexibility.,On foot, by car, on the roads or by rail, we switch from one mode to the other depending on what works best – and more often than not it’s quicker by bike!"

","At the Museum,Exhibitions and Galleries,Families","space,yuri gagarin","In the run-up to the 50th anniversary of the first man in space our very own version of Yuri Gagarin has blogged about how he was selected and trained for his mission.,,Now, you’ve probably read books or seen films about the American space programme. You’ll know that their plans were announced in the press and ambitious military pilots tried desperately hard to get selected. That is the American way – but in the Soviet Union things are different.,One day, a mysterious group of people arrived at my air base. They interviewed pilots and then a few weeks later they returned and spoke to a smaller number of us. More probing questions but still we did not know what they wanted us for. Until the question–,‘Lieutenant Gagarin, how would you like to do something very different – a whole new type of flying?’,Now I knew! They wanted me to transfer to helicopters.,‘With respect comrade, I am a fighter pilot and would rather continue to fly fast jets.,‘We’re not talking about helicopters. Listen, how would you feel about flying in space?’,‘Oh . . . yes. Yes Comrade!’,So began my training – although sometimes torture might be a better word. The medical tests – x-rays, lights shone into the eyes, hammers to test reflex, probes in the ears, twisting, stretching…,Then there was the isolation chamber – a steel box with no windows, no clock, no books, no music, no night and day, nothing but work – and boredom. Our tormentors would change the temperature and pressure without warning or suddenly turn the lights on or off. Try ten days of that.,Oh, and the ‘maths’ tests. We would be given difficult maths problems to work out and as we struggled with the problems, a comforting calm and friendly voice whispered the answers into our headphones. The wrong answers of course.,And the centrifuge… A great spinning arm, with us on the end. As the arm went faster, we would be squashed further into our seats 2, 3, 4, –12 times normal gravity. Breathing hard, face twisted, eyes pulled open, heart pounding and blood as heavy as mercury. We knew that we had to endure all this with no complaint but a smile, if we were to get to space.,But it wasn’t all bad. At the end of all this we would be cosmonauts – space travellers. You see, our name for someone who goes into space is much better than the name that the Americans decided to use. Astronaut means star traveller and that’s nonsense. No one has ever travelled to a star and they never can.,Yuri will be back on 12 April to talk us through his incredible journey. You can also meet him in the Museum."

Our aim is to make the museum as accessible as possible. Part of this is running events like
SIGNtific
, where stories and workshops are presented in British Sign Language, and
Early Birds
, mornings where the museum opens early for families with children on the Autistic spectrum.,To build on the successes of our SIGNtific and Early Birds events, we wanted to improve visits for families with children who are visually impaired (VI).
Having identified our target audience, we did as much research as we could about how to best tailor our events.,We set out to talk to as many people as possible, sharing ideas, experiences, and best practice. We looked into how science is taught at schools for partially sighted and blind children, how organisations that work with partially sighted and blind children run workshops and activities, and we sought out the best events at other amazing museums and galleries.,Suddenly every visit to an exhibition involved asking around ‘what activities do you do for families with visually impaired children?’, every visit to a website involved scouring their accessible events pages, every meeting with a fellow museum professional involved asking them about what they were doing for this audience.,Most of the programmes for blind and partially sighted people we found were aimed at adults not families. This made us redouble our efforts, and that’s when we met Barry Ginley, the Disability Access Manager from the V&A, and his lovely Guide Dog, Skye.,He gave us training on working with people with visual impairments and information on the issues children with VI can face. He had us walk around the Museum blindfolded, an experience which helped us realise how much more aware we became of our surroundings; objects, people and the giant Rugby Tuning Coil all became potential hazards.,With the research done, the activities developed, and miniature tactile versions of Mars built we were finally ready and the date, 15 March was set, Mother’s day, a perfect day for family activities. The day included four events: a touch tour and audio described ‘Rocket Show’, a hands-on workshop called ‘Backpacking to Mars’, a touch table of Information Age gallery objects, and a tour of the Information Age gallery.,Did the families enjoy it? Would further events like this be welcome at the Science Museum? It is a resounding yes for both.,The feedback we received was extremely positive which made all of the hard work worth it. If you are interested in attending one of our future events for families with blind and visually impaired children, please drop us an email at
familyprogrammes@sciencemuseum.ac.uk
saying you’d like to be added to our ‘VI mailing list’.,The Special Events Team will be running

Charles Babbage
is best known for his calculating engines, plans of which are now
on display
in the Computing gallery, he was a life long inventor with a passion for improvement.,As a 16 year old
Babbage
nearly drowned when he trialed his newly invented shoes for walking on water. This setback failed to discourage him and Babbage’s inventions ranged from designs for a locomotive ‘cow catcher’, an automaton for playing noughts and crosses, a ‘black box’ recorder for monitoring railway tracks and ‘speaking-tubes’ linking London and Liverpool among many other ideas.,Babbage fervently believed that new inventions should be freely available to all – when he constructed the first known opthalmoscope in 1847 for internal eye examinations he refused to patent it. The credit went to Herman von Helmhotz 4 years later instead.,You can see another of Babbage’s inventions in the Museum – an occulting light mechanism to help with ship navigation. Ship captains used lights on shore to steer by but the increasing number of lights on the coast led to confusion. Babbage designed a light with mechanical shutters to create a unique flashing signal for ships.,Frustratingly for Babbage, this invention, like many of his ideas, found no favour at home. It did however sufficiently impress the Russians, who used the principle of his signalling lights against the British in the Crimean war.,Babbage’s foresight wasn’t limited to his inventions. He predicted the end of the coal mines and recommended tidal power instead, commenting that if posterity failed to find a substitute source of power it deserved to be ‘frostbitten’!,See more of Babbage’s inventive drawings in a new display in the Science Museum’s

The Prince’s Trust workshops
, which will be run in partnership with the
Science Museum
in schools across the country, at the museum with Ian Blatchford, Director of the Museum, and Martina Milburn, Chief Executive of the Prince’s Trust.,“Inspiring young people through science and technology is a powerful tool,” said will.i.am, who has donated £500,000 to the Trust, including his fee as a judge on BBC talent show, The Voice, and funds the i.am.angel foundation in his native Los Angeles.,“These workshops are an amazing way to engage disadvantaged youngsters who don’t have this sort of access to technology and science otherwise.” Speaking to reporters at the launch of the workshops he said: “As well as telling them to play sports, let’s encourage them to do science or mathematics.,“When I say, ‘Hey kids, you guys should want to be scientists, technicians, engineers and mathematicians…’ I say that because I too am going to school to learn computer science,“ he added. “I’m taking a computer science course, because I’m passionate about where the world’s going, curious about it and I want to contribute.”,The new partnership will see Science Museum outreach staff visiting Prince’s Trust xl clubs in schools across the country to deliver workshops after normal lessons that are aimed at inspiring and engaging 13-19 year olds who are struggling at school. The overall aim is to help 3,000 to 4,000 young people this year.,The launch of the workshops comes ahead of a Prince’s Trust report to be released today revealing a lack of digital skills among the younger generation. The research, conducted by Ipsos MORI, shows a quarter of unemployed young people (24%) “dread” filling in online job applications and one in ten (11%) admit they avoid using computers.,The Science Museum is the most popular free school-trip destination in the UK and runs the most popular
outreach programme
for children in the country, reaching 110,000 children per annum. More children take part in events and activities at the Science Museum than any other in the country.,Toby Parkin, Outreach and Resources Manager, from the Science Museum said: “We know the importance of making science exciting and accessible to everyone. Our initiative with The Prince’s Trust aims to encourage youngsters who may not have considered science and technology as a possible career path. The workshops will span the country across 2013 and see many more young people experimenting with technology and science.”,The Science Museum is the home of human ingenuity in this sector: it has been pioneering interactive science interpretation for over 80 years and was the first in Europe to set up a sleepover programme, the first to tour science and technology exhibitions to shopping centres and is the home of the world’s only science comedy troupe.,Roger Highfield is Director of External Affairs at the Science Museum"

",Science in the news,,"It is remarkable to think that some of the greatest scientific thinkers who have ever lived, the likes of
Darwin
,
Galileo
,
Copernicus
and
Boltzmann
, were all born in early February.,Austrian physicist Ludwig
Boltzmann
, born on 20 February 1844, is remembered for his work in the development of statistical mechanics, used to predict how the properties of atoms can determine the behaviour of matter. Boltzmann’s pioneering scientific contributions to kinetic theory – which described the speed of atoms in a gas – came at a time when many scientists disbelieved an atom’s very existence.,Over half a millennia ago (540 years ago yesterday in fact),
Nicolaus Copernicus
was born in a small medieval town in Poland. Copernicus would go on to fundamentally challenge our sense of place in the cosmos, publishing his ideas of the heliocentric universe just two months before his death in May 1543.
On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres
, along with many other objects from the history of astronomy, are on display in our
Cosmos and Culture
exhibition.,Copernicus’s ideas were supported by Italian astronomer and mathematician
Galileo Galilei
, born 15 February 1564. After failing to complete his studies in medicine at Pisa, Galileo turned his attention to mathematics. Experiments in 1604 with rolling balls down an inclined plane, led Galileo to deduce the law of falling bodies and show that the speed with which bodies fall is independent of their weight.,In 1609, Galileo reinvented the refracting telescope leading to numerous astronomical findings, including the discovery of four moons of Jupiter, which he published in
Siderius Nuncius
(The Starry Messenger) – on display in our
Cosmos and Culture
exhibition. Galileo’s support for Copernicus’s view of a sun-centred solar system brought him into direct opposition with the church and led in 1633 to his imprisonment under house arrest.,Also born in early February were two Naturalists,
Charles Darwin
(born 12 Feb 1809) and
Sir Joseph Banks
(13 Feb 1742), who travelled the world – with Banks joining Captain Cook’s voyage to the South Pacific on board HMS Endeavour and Darwin sailing on HMS Beagle – identifying new species (1300 in in the case of Joseph Banks) and exploring geological features and plant and animal life across the globe.,Outside of his travels to far-off lands, including Newfoundland, Tahiti and New Zealand,
Banks
was known for his promotion of science. On his return to Britain, Banks wrote detailed descriptions of the people and places he had encountered, and later become honorary director of the
Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew
and a Trustee of the
British Museum
, before being elected President of the
Royal Society
in 1778.,Charles Darwin
joined a five-year scientific expedition on HMS Beagle, studying a vast array of plants, animals and geological wonders. On his return in 1836, he began to think in earnest about the mechanisms that had generated such variety in nature.,Influenced by the thinking of Thomas Malthus, Darwin developed his theory of evolution through natural selection over the next two decades, only publishing his work after learning that another naturalist,
Alfred Russel Wallace
, had developed similar ideas.
On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection
went on to transform the way the natural world was understood across the world."

– a device used to generate microwaves – in 1940 at the University of Birmingham, but the UK lacked the funds and manufacturing resources for large scale production. In an extraordinary gesture, Winston Churchill offered the magnetron (a smaller, more power design than anything else available) to the USA in exchange for financial and industrial support.,It was, in the words of one American historian,
“the most valuable cargo ever brought to our shores,”
and by early 1941, mass production had enabled portable airborne microwave radar systems to be fitted to American and British aircraft. Vastly superior to the rival German systems, the cavity magnetron gave the Allies a considerable advantage, directly influencing the outcome of the war.,This British innovation, one of the most significant to be developed during World War II, is now found across the world inside microwave ovens.

Astronomers have since detected more than 1800 pulsars, and their precise nature make them useful tools for astronomical observations.,In the past Jocelyn’s work has been over looked – the

Royal Academy of Engineering
on science and its impact on the UK economy.,The UK has a proud track record of research excellence. We are responsible for 14 of the top 100 medicines in use today (second only to the USA) and have developed technology found in 95% of the world’s mobile phones. Thanks to previous sustained investment we have the most productive research base of the world’s leading economies and our researchers have claimed over 90 Nobel Prizes.,The recent
Great British Innovation Vote
showed the impact and diversity of our achievements over the last century – and many exciting new developments just opening up, from
ionic liquids
and
graphene
to
hypersonic planes
and
quantum dots
.,Many of the great challenges that we face – like food security, climate change, energy security and the impacts of ageing – require expertise and collaboration right across the humanities, social, engineering, physical, medical, chemical, biological and mathematical sciences. Responding to climate change, for example, requires an understanding of both the scientific evidence and the engineering approaches to tackle it plus the socioeconomic effects and how they interact.,So efficient is our research system that it achieves world-leading results despite the government spending less on research than our competitors do. The UK government spent just 0.57% of GDP on research and development in 2011, in comparison to 0.85% in Germany and 0.92% in the USA.,This week the UK’s four national academies – the
Academy of Medical Sciences

interview
with Sir Paul Nurse on this report.,The Academies wish to see a stable 10 year investment framework for research, innovation and skills, which should sit at the heart of its emerging industrial strategy and plans for growth.,The science budget is essential to the future economic development of the country and it should continue to be ringfenced to ensure that our highly efficient research system is well resourced. Science, research and engineering should continue to inform policy making across Whitehall.,The Academies want the UK to provide a world class research and innovation environment that is attractive to talent and investment from industry and from overseas and that inspires and supports the next generation of researchers."

Learning department
(mainly with the Explainers) at the
Science Museum
. We are here to gain vocational skills and experience in a working environment.  This will prepare us for work in the future and provides us with a Level 2 NVQ in Cultural Heritage and Venue Operations qualification, which is widely recognised by employers.,Jorden, 17
“I chose to do an apprenticeship because I didn’t like working in a classroom environment; in college I’d get bored really quickly, even in the subjects I was really interested in. But working at the Science Museum is the complete opposite, I’ve learnt so many skills and I really enjoy helping the visitors; the best part is interacting with the children and encouraging them to have fun while they learn something new. The environment is full of surprises and there are a range of different tasks to keep me busy, so no two days are the same. The Learning team is really friendly and the Explainers in particular have a strong team, they’re really enthusiastic about helping each other out and everyone does their part to make sure the day runs smoothly.,When I complete my apprenticeship, I’d really like to work with the Outreach team going round to schools and bringing some of the excitement from the Museum into the classrooms.”,Vickie, 17
“I decided to do the apprenticeship because I love doing anything to do with the Science Museum. I feel proud to say that I work at the Museum and I love what I do. The environment at the Museum is so friendly and you learn so much without even realising. The Explainer department is so exciting and inviting; you can make friends with everyone and not feel left out. When I complete this apprenticeship I would love to stay on as an Explainer and start to do shows. I love entertaining people and showing them really cool things, such as explosions in one of our Launchpad shows!,I would advise everyone to come to the Science Museum. You wouldn’t believe your eyes if you saw some on the amazing things we have to offer. My highlight so far has been seeing Will Smith in the IMAX cinema!”,Toni, 18
“I chose to go for this apprenticeship because I always came to the Science Museum when I was a little girl. So when I saw the ad on the
apprenticeship website
, I got excited and quickly applied. I was over the moon when I found out I got the job! When I first started I was scared of the Explainers, however, as time went on I realised they aren’t scary and I began to have conversations with them.,I have recently performed demos to the Explainers at a meeting. One of these demos included using plastic cups and an air-zuka (the air-zuka looks like a plastic tube and handle with a plastic bag on the end). I had to pull back the bag and let go, shooting air out in a spiral vortex which knocked down the cups, in my case it knocked down 3 cups out of the 7. Performing the demos was one of the scariest things I have ever done because I was performing demos to the performers and it took a lot of practice and support to build up the courage to perform them. But once I started performing them to the Explainers, I started to feel calmer and they began to laugh because of the humour I had added. At the end of the demos, all the Explainers gave me compliments and said I did well. I now feel like part of the team and enjoy working with them. I have also learned some Makaton during my time at the Museum, which is a language to help communicate with those with special needs. After my apprenticeship, I want to apply to work as a full-time Explainer.”,Apprentice Fact:
If you combined the ages of all 3 apprentices together, it’s less than the age of the oldest Science Museum Explainer."

Collider
,
a new
Science Museum
exhibition opening in November 2013. The first part can be read
here
.,Day 2, Thursday,On
the first day
of the
Collider
exhibition team’s visit to CERN we had explored the architecture and interiors of the town-sized laboratory. Now it was time to enter its beating heart: the gigantic experiments probing the fundamental laws of the universe, and the people who make them a reality.,Our team now divided. Pippa, Finn and crew set off to the far side of the 27km LHC ring to Point 5, home of the enormous
Compact Muon Solenoid
(CMS) experiment. 100 metres underground, 25 metres long, 15 metres high, weighing in at 12,500 tonnes and containing enough iron to build two Eiffel Towers, CMS is one of the four huge detectors that record the particle collisions produced by the Large Hadron Collider. It is also a remarkable sight, beautiful even, its concentric layers giving it the appearance of a gigantic cybernetic eye. One member of the team said it was the most incredible thing he had ever seen, with only the Pantheon in Rome coming close to matching it.,CMS was photographed from every angle so that it can be recreated in a 360 immersive projection for the
Collider
exhibition. The CMS team were incredibly accommodating in allowing us to get our cameras as close to CMS as possible, all while they carried out vital work on the detector. We owe particular thanks to the boundlessly energetic Michael Hoch who looked after us for the day and made it all possible.,Meanwhile, 13km around the ring, in a less spectacular CERN office, our radio producer and I carried out audio interviews of LHC physicists and engineers. Each of them sharing what makes them tick as scientists and inventors. One even surprised us by dismissing the discovery of the Higgs boson as “boring”; what drives him as a scientist is seeking answers to new questions. For him the Higgs threatens to be a dead-end on the journey of discovery, rather than opening up new avenues of inquiry. Over the course of the day we interviewed five members of CERN’s international community, drawn from across Europe, representing a diverse cross section of CERN’s most important asset, its people.,Day 3, Friday,The last day might have been the most challenging. The team assembled at CERN’s custom-built TV studio to film interviews with LHC engineers against a green screen. These are the people who build and operate CERN’s experiments and they will appear as full-body projections in the exhibition, as if museum visitors have wandered into the LHC tunnel to be met by a friendly member of staff. Over dinner the night before we had shared anxieties as to how it might go. Video, unlike audio, can’t be edited to remove fumbled words or long pauses – our interviewees would have to deliver near-perfect speeches, and none of them had ever done anything like this before. In fact, neither had any of us.,Our concerns were unfounded. The engineers were naturals and by the end of the day we had recorded some brilliant interviews that should really help bring CERN to life for the visitors to the exhibition.,We returned to London that evening, exhausted but carrying a huge amount of material, covering almost every aspect of the Large Hadron Collider. For the first time I really have a sense of what this
Collider
exhibition will become; it’s going to be quite something to see it take shape over the next five months. If you can’t make it to Geneva to see the LHC in person, you’ll find a healthy slice of the world’s greatest experiment at South Kensington this November."
https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/wonderful-things-the-drug-castle/,Micol Molinari,Wonderful Things: The Drug Castle,,"Collections and Objects,Education","art,medicine","Kate Davis, a Learning Resources Project Developer, discovers the story behind one of our more unusual objects.,The
fifth floor
of the Science Museum is a fascinating area, full of gory and often unusual paraphernalia related to the history of medicine. One of the more unusual objects lurking in this gallery is the
Drug Castle
.,Our
knowledge of medicine
and how civilisations have treated illness and disease stretches all the way back to the earliest writings on the subject from Ancient Egypt. However, the ways in which people have treated illness has not changed very much over the centuries. It is only during the last 200 years that scientific developments have gathered pace and enabled doctors to make huge breakthroughs in treatments. It is often easy for us, living in the 21
st
Century, to forget that as little as 100 years ago there was no
penicillin
, nobody knew the cause of
rickets
and there was no vaccine for tuberculosis.,Now, we can mass produce a whole range of pills and potions for a variety of different ailments that had previously been untreatable. All of the syringes, pill bottles and tablets used to create the Drug Castle are real and it is a brilliant visualisation of how central the use of drugs has become to the treatment of illness in the developed world. However, this shift in how we treat disease does not come without its controversy.,The Drug Castle itself is a reminder of this as it was created to feature in a poster campaign by the
East London Health Project
in 1978. This campaign aimed to raise questions about whether pharmaceutical companies were more interested in making money or making their medicines available to all. Health care is extremely costly and is frequently an issue that is considered and debated by governments worldwide as they try to provide the best health care they can for their citizens with the funds that they have available to them.,There are also significant issues with the effectiveness of the drugs that are prescribed by doctors.  One of the primary examples of this is with antibiotics, that when first manufactured, were very effective at treating infections, but now are less so because the bacteria has mutated so that antibiotics, such as penicillin, are not as useful. Therefore, in order to keep treating infection scientists will need to develop new drugs that can combat these more virulent illnesses.,Should we keep creating new drugs for antibiotic resistant bugs – or do we need to change the way we take medicines?"

You’re in luck. Every year, a specially selected group of researchers and technologists from across the nation, take over the Royal Society building and garden and turn them into an incredible
celebration of scientific endeavour
– the Summer Science Exhibition – filled with interactive exhibits, games, live demonstrations, prizes, and conversation.,What’s on this year? You can find out how scientists use
cutting edge technology to monitor wildlife
and protect biodiversity. Maybe you’re interested in the idea of teleporting yourself? Head to meet the

essential oils as antimicrobial agents
. Killing germs never smelled so good!,Recently I heard
Anne Glover
, chief scientific advisor to the president of the European Commission, say in a talk that, “research not communicated is research not done”. It’s true. For scientists working in their labs, in the field, or up in space, it is not enough to ‘just’ carry out the research; it must get out there – entering the public domain, so that science can be part of everyday culture – or it might as well have never happened. So on top of pushing back the frontiers of knowledge, researchers also have to make sure that information is accessible. It is a big responsibility.,This is why events like the
Summer Science Exhibition
are so worth supporting: not only are they a chance for young and old alike to meet real scientists (in their regular clothes!) and be inspired by their passion, but by attending, we help scientists communicate their work widely, fueling the demand for public engagement to become an integral part of scientist’s work. These can only be good things.,For the Science Museum
Learning team
, the Summer Science Exhibition is extra special.

John Liffen, Curator of Communication, provides details of transcription.,As one of the conservators working on the new
Information Age
gallery, opening in September 2014, I handle, document and carry out treatments on objects destined for display.  Working so closely with artifacts means I am often in the lucky position of discovering new quirks or secrets, as I was recently reminded when undertaking conservation of some Morse code tapes from the
S.S Great Eastern
voyage of 1865.,Looking at the tapes on a shelf in our Telecommunications Store, sitting alongside larger and grander objects, they appeared deceptively small and manageable, while at the same time they held the promise of untold stories.  Curator of Communication, John Liffen, informed me that within living memory at the museum the tapes had never been unravelled and no transcription of the message existed. It was now my job to enable this task! Firstly, I had to determine the object’s condition. Wound round an old paper envelope core the tapes were overlapping as they were coiled round and round.,While providing a compact means of storage, the tapes looked under stress.  They were, however strong enough for unravelling to take place.  The unwinding was quite a slow process as it turned out there were nine tapes wound together, with some being very lengthy.,Once unravelled, the tapes were lightly cleaned with Smoke Sponge, a natural vulcanised rubber which gently picked up dust and dirt.  The tapes then needed to be humidified to relax the bends and creases caused by having been rolled.  Direct moisture causes cockling of paper and potential running of inks, so instead the paper was rested on a one-way permeable membrane to allow vapour, rather than water though.  Once lying flat the tears were repaired using heat set tissue, activated with a heated spatula.,The main problem encountered at the transcription stage was that the dots and dashes inked on the tape can at times be ambiguous, with a dot often looking like a dash and vice versa.  As John says,,“To a twenty-first century researcher much of the Morse on the tapes translates as random letters. However, in places recognisable words can be read. On piece 1, the phrases ‘still in Vienna have red red’ and ‘none from Paris’ can be seen. Piece 6 was indecipherable, but when the tape was inverted the phrase ‘concludes lead iron cable’ was found within a string of Morse letters. This is more promising as part of a possible message. Most intriguingly, on piece 4 can be found ‘love to Sophbin’. Presumably ‘Sophie’ is the intended word but the Morse clearly shows a ‘b’ after the letter h. Whoever Sophie was, how did she come to be on board the Great Eastern during its cable-laying voyage?”."

Information Age
project takes a look at the humble computer mouse, Douglas Englebart’s best-known contribution to modern computing.,Since its invention in 1963, the computer mouse has become an iconic image of personal computing. It was designed and developed by visionary engineer
Douglas Engelbart
who recently passed away on 4
th
July 2013 at the age of 88.,This early version of the computer mouse bears very little resemblance to those that we use today – it began as simply a wooden shell encasing a circuit board attached to two wheels which allowed movement across a surface. It was the wire that extended from the wooden shell and connected it to the computer that gave it is resemblance to its namesake – christening it a ‘mouse.’,Whilst the function of the mouse has remained the same since this initial model, the design has become much more streamlined. In 1972 computer engineer
Bill English
replaced the wheels for a ball, allowing the mouse to move in any direction. However this design soon encountered problems when dirt accumulated on the ball and restricted its use and as a result, in 1981 the mouse underwent another redesign.,It was then that engineers at technology company Xerox developed the first optical mouse, which worked by using focused beams of light to detect the movement of the mouse relative the surface it was on. In successive years, the combination of reduced cost in equipment and the progression in optical technology provided us with the optical computer mice that are used widely today.,While computer mice have retained their popularity with desktop computers and laptops, more intuitive computer interface technologies started becoming favoured on tablet computers and smart phones.,In the early 1990’s, the stylus pen began to be used widely, particularly with smart phones and message pads. Shortly after, the pen was lost and multi-touch screens became the most popular means to interact with these devices. These screens can detect two or more points of contact on an interface so users can rotate, pinch and zoom in on graphics – something you may be used to doing on your mobile phone.,This technology is so effortless to use it is difficult to think of how this interaction can become any easier – but what if you didn’t have to do anything at all? What if all you had to do was
think
about what you wanted your computer to do?,This month, scientists at the University of Washington have published findings showing that patients who had a thin layer of electrodes placed in their brain were able to move a cursor on a computer screen by demand by
just thinking about it
. Although in the early stages, this technology has the potential for users to communicate with computers using only their thoughts to control the commands on the screen.,While the idea of computers interpreting our thoughts may seem like a daunting prospect for most, patients suffering with severe forms of paralysis could find this research to be a life-line, allowing them to communicate with people via computers for the first time.,At the moment it is unknown whether this technology will be taken further commercially. Do you think it has the potential to be used at home or work to improve our lives? Or do you think this could take our relationship with computer technology too far?,A replica of Englebart’s mouse prototype will be on display in the Science Museum’s new
Information Age
gallery, opening in September 2014."

Wroughton
.,This week I’ve headed up to Manchester to talk about a tiny part of
Information Age
at the
biggest ever history of science conference
. Together with some other people from the Information Age team I’m running a special
session
about communications technology in Africa, with a special focus on Cameroon.,Last year a small group of us were lucky enough to go to Cameroon on a field trip to collect a range of objects for the museum that show how mobile phones have affected peoples’ lives. Just like in Britain, the mobile phone means that people organise themselves differently now that they’re constantly connected.,But, in Cameroon telecommunication technology used to be very expensive and difficult to access for most people, and now many more people can own and use a mobile phone making communication much easier. Although we collected lots of different kinds of mobile phone technologies I want to tell you about just one of objects we collected.,Emmanuel Bongsunu lives and works in
Bamenda
, in the English speaking part of Cameroon. He set up his first call box business in the late 1990s, very soon after mobile phones were introduced into the country. His call box tells the story of how the business evolved over time. In the picture you can see the original part of the call box – the small yellow box at the front that he would have sat behind, probably under an umbrella. As the business grew so too did his call box until eventually it was big enough to stand in, and even had its own electricity supply. When we spoke to Emmanuel he offered to sell us his call box as it would allow him to get a brand new one made to meet his needs today. It was such a great example that we couldn’t resist – even though getting such a big object back to the UK was going to be tricky.,A local carpenter helped us by building enormous crates to put our objects in, and his team also helped us to dismantle this large item. It was difficult to watch it being taken to pieces, and I made endless notes and labelled each part carefully so we would know how to put it back together afterwards.,A few weeks ago I travelled to our stores at
Wroughton
to work with two of the Science Museum’s conservation team to finally bring the call box back to life. Diana McCormack and Esther Sharp have written about the part they played in reconstructing this rather dilapidated object. Here’s what they had to say:,When this item first arrived at Wroughton we froze it to eliminate any unwanted pest activity, after that it arrived in the conservation laboratory in its disassembled state. We decided to give the object a relatively light clean and to make only necessary repairs to the structure to allow it to be put back together in a stable condition.  Running repairs and rough edges were all part of the object’s history and we wanted to preserve this, making it look too clean or new would not give a true impression of its working life, or the piecemeal way in which it had been constructed.,We did a light surface clean to remove some insect debris and thick soiling that had built up during transportation. Original nails also had to be removed where they were sticking out from the timbers as they were usually bent and corroded and would get in the way of the reassembly, as well posing as a safety hazard to the team. We used modern fixings in the re-build instead, as this involved putting the timbers under less stress and also means in the future it will be obvious which bits are the original object, and which bits we added. Anything we added to the object has been carefully recorded.,Some timbers had to be repaired for the structural integrity of the object; in these cases the damage had been caused entirely through the deconstruction process.  The work included ‘consolidating’ the feet of the object to prevent any of the original wood being lost and to protect them during transport to the gallery. Working on the roof was quite challenging, and we built a special support so that it could be worked on upside-down. We haven’t put the roof back on yet because it’ll be easier to transport it back to London in two pieces ready for the display.,Keep your eyes peeled for future posts about how we’re working with Cameroonians based in London to decide together how the various objects we brought back should be displayed."

",Exhibitions and Galleries,"collider,physics","Ahead of November’s opening of the
Collider exhibition
, Content Developer Rupert Cole explains how beer was used for cutting-edge particle physics research.,Late one night in 1953,
Donald Glaser
smuggled a case of beer into his University lab. He wanted to test out the limitations of his revolutionary invention: the
bubble chamber
.,Previously, Glaser had only tried exotic chemical liquids in his device. But now his sense of experimental adventure had been galvanised by a recent victory over the great and famously infallible physicist
Enrico Fermi
.,Fermi, who had invited Glaser to Chicago to find out more about his invention, had already seemingly proved that a bubble chamber could not work. But when Glaser found a mistake in Fermi’s authoritative textbook, he dedicated himself to redoing the calculations.,Glaser found that, if he was correct, that the bubble chamber should work with water. To make absolutely certain he “wasn’t being stupid”, Glaser conducted this curious nocturnal experiment at his Michigan laboratory. He also discovered that the bubble chamber worked just as well when using lager as it had with other chemicals.,There was one practical issue however, the beer caused the whole physics department to smell like a brewery. “And this was a problem for two reasons,” Glaser recalled. “One is that it was illegal to have any alcoholic beverage within 500 yards of the university. The other problem was that the chairman was a very devout teetotaler, and he was furious. He almost fired me on the spot”.,On 1
st
August 1953, 60 years ago this Thursday, Glaser published his famous paper on the bubble chamber – strangely failing to mention the beer experiment.,Glaser’s device provided a very effective way to detect and visualise particles. It consisted of a tank of pressurised liquid, which was then
superheated
by reducing the pressure. Charged particles passing through the tank stripped electrons from atoms in the liquid and caused the liquid to boil. Bubbles created from the boiling liquid revealed the particle’s path through the liquid.,One of Glaser’s motivations for his invention was to avoid having to work with large groups of scientists at big particle accelerators. Instead, he hoped his device would enable him to study
cosmic rays
using
cloud chambers
in the traditional fashion; up a mountain, ski in the day, “and work in sort of splendid, beautiful surroundings. A very pleasant way of life – intellectual, aesthetic, and athletic”,Ironically, as the bubble chamber only worked with controlled sources of particles, it was inherently suited to accelerator research, not cosmic rays. Soon the large accelerator facilities built their own, massive bubble chambers.,Between 1965-1970 CERN built
Gargamelle
– a bubble chamber of such proportions that it was named after a giantess from the novels of Francois Rabelais (not the
Smurfs’
villain). Gargamelle proved a huge success, enabling the discovery of
neutral currents
– a crucial step in understanding how some of the basic forces of nature were once unified.,This November you’ll have the chance to see up close the original design drawings for Gargamelle, and much more in the
Collider
exhibition."

Pluto
on 14 July 2015 by NASA’s
New Horizons
spacecraft means that humans have now explored (with robotic assistance) every planet in our solar system.
New Horizons
flew within 7,750m of Pluto, travelling at 31,000mph as it sped past the (dwarf) planet that lies 3 billion miles from our home.,This historic flyby completes a quest that began in the 1960s with NASA’s Mariner and the
Soviet Venera missions
to Venus. You can see an engineering test model of
Venera 7
in our
Cosmonauts exhibition
from September 2015.,New Horizons
is capturing high resolution images and scientific data, but can only send images back to Earth at 1 kilobit per second, fifty times slower than a 56k modem from the 1990s. Even travelling at the speed of light, it takes almost four and a half hours for the data to reach Earth.,As we wait for
detailed close up photos
of Pluto from New Horizons (others have already been sent back to Earth), we took a look at some Pluto-related objects in our collections.,A device similar to this CCD (Charge Coupled Device), on display in our
Exploring Space gallery
, will capture the first close up images of Pluto ever taken. Made by British company
e2v
, the CCD will be used in the PERSI (Pluto Exploration Remote Sensing Investigation)
Ralph telescope
, with a similar device in the spacecraft’s LORRI (Long Range Reconnaissance Imager) instrument.,The
first discovery photographs
of Pluto where taken in February 1930, by a young American astronomer. At the time
Clyde Tombaugh
was searching for a predicted ‘Planet X’ that might explain oddities in the orbits of Neptune and Uranus.,Tombaugh spent months painstakingly photographing the same sections of sky and studying the images with a
blink comparator
. On 18 February 1930, he noticed that on photographs taken a few nights apart that January, one ‘star’ had moved, indicating that it was actually a nearby object moving against the fixed background of distant stars. You can see a glass positive of the photograph in our
Cosmos and Culture
exhibition.,Further observations confirmed the discovery, which was announced to the world in March 1930. Despite the fanfare, Pluto turned out not to be Planet X – Tombaugh had just been looking in the right place at the right time. Subsequent observations revealed that Pluto was too small to match the predictions. Eventually, revised calculations of Neptune and Uranus’s orbits removed the need for Planet X altogether.,Thanks to New Horizons, Tombaugh has come closer to Pluto than anyone else as some of his ashes are on board the spacecraft.,By the 2000s, astronomers had discovered a slew of similarly-sized bodies beyond Neptune. Either our Solar System had a lot more planets than anyone had realised, or it was time to rethink what counts as a planet.,On 24 August 2006 the International Astronomical Union voted on
a new definition
, demoting Pluto to ‘dwarf planet’. ‘Save Pluto’ campaigns were quick to follow, and these
bumper stickers
(also on display in the
Cosmos and Culture
exhibition) were some of the first products to go on sale.,The IAU’s definition of ‘planet’ remains controversial, so there may be hope for Pluto yet. Until July 2015 we knew very little about Pluto as it was so faint and far away, but with new images and scientific data we can finally discover the secrets of this (dwarf) planet, three billion miles away."

Outreach and Resources Team
.,The Outreach team usually works outside the Museum, but for four days in June we were based inside and put on a ‘Day at the Museum’ event which was sponsored by Google. 600 children aged 10-11 from 12 schools across the capital came to visit us, and were treated to a jam-packed day of science activities.,The children started their day all together, watching the ‘It Takes Guts’ show; an interactive science show all about the Digestive system. Here they got to experience the journey our food takes once it enters our mouths, and answer some of those burning questions, like “why is our poo brown?”. Having been thoroughly entertained and a little ‘grossed out’ they headed off to their other activities.,In the News and Views workshop, the children got the chance to become science reporters, working in teams to create an article based around an open question on a science topic. To start the workshop we asked the children what came to mind when they thought of scientists, and as you can imagine, many of the answers centred around lab coats, goggles and ‘crazy hair’.,We then challenged these perceptions by introducing real scientists (none of whom were wearing labcoats, and all with perfectly nice hair), who came to present the research they are working on.,Neuroscientist Anita spoke about her research into links between attention in children and video games. Ask any room of year 6 pupils about video games and I guarantee the majority will be instantly in favour. After listening to Anita however, they began to think more critically, and started to identify pro’s and con’s to put into their articles. The sessions also gave the children a chance to learn some interesting science that wouldn’t have been covered in the classroom, such as seeing first hand the effects capsaicin (the active ingredient in chillis) had on their teachers!,A trip to the Museum however would not be complete without visiting some of our galleries. The students got the chance to try out some science experiments for themselves using the interactive exhibits in Launchpad.,They also explored some of our amazing objects that shaped the history of science, as part of the Great Object Hunt in
Making the Modern World
and our new
Information Age
galleries.,At the end of the day we bid farewell to the children, who left with smiles on their faces and also a goody bag of science museum trinkets, including a ‘Golden Ticket’ for themselves and their families to come back again and see a film in our
IMAX cinema
.,When asking the children in the News and Views workshop what a scientist is, one child answered “it’s just someone who really likes science and finding out about the world”. Hopefully the children who visited us went home having not only had a brilliant experience at the museum, but also all sharing the view that science is a vast and interesting field, where there really is something for everyone."

In recent years the patents on simple 3D printing technologies have run out. 3D printers have become available to more people in the form of
affordable consumer models
, or even as open source plans freely available on the internet.,This new freedom to invent has generated an explosion of creativity. And it’s not just hackers, tinkerers and makers who’ve felt the benefits of this new breath of life for engineering and design, but established industry and academia too. So how do you represent a diverse and dynamic explosion of creativity?,In July we began collecting 3D printed stuff for what has been known as ‘an explosion’, our ‘mass display’, ‘the wave’, ‘the wall’ and (my favourite) a ‘tsunami of objects’.

All the Year Round
article of 1863. The subject of his ire was an astronomical lecture, a popular entertainment of the time. The young Dickens was unimpressed with the ageing and shabby demonstration instrument, ‘at least one thousand stars and twenty five comets behind the age’, with poor likenesses of the celestial bodies and malfunctioning light effects. The lecturer also droned on, tapping away at the model ‘like a wearisome woodpecker’.,Dickens might have had better luck with Mr Bartley’s lectures. Bartley was a comedian for most of the year, but turned his talents to astronomy when the comedy shows stopped for Lent.,19th century astronomical shows were often spectacular theatrical events – perhaps why Dickens was so disappointed with the shabby and outdated performance he encountered.

‘the careful management of change’
.,The objects in our collection are often acquired for their historical significance. They tell us a story, and we aim to maintain the condition of the objects so that their story will never be lost.,That is why we don’t ‘restore’ things to look brand new. The marks on that piece of

is 1998-15 – it was acquired in 1998 and was the 15th object that year to be acquired.,All new acquisitions are now photographed on arrival, so there is a permanent record which can be used for reference later on or for use in exhibitions or catalogues. With our digitisation projects such as
Ingenious
and
Brought to Life
we are trying to get as much of our collections photographed so we can share the brilliant stuff that is in our stores.,The whole collections database is now available
online
.,Before the digital age, all acquisition records were paper based. The earliest inventory number in the Science Museum’s collections is 1857-3 – a 1:4 model of James Nasmyth’s direct-action steam hammer. Information was catalogued on Form 100 cards that looked like this:,From time to time, objects do get de-accessioned and go through a rigorous process to ensure the objects go to good homes. Each object is debated, condition checked and when approved its transferred, sometimes to another museum. Most recently a series of tractors were transferred to

It was a deeply covetable sport car available in two models – one with fixed position head lights and the other with drop-heads.,If the Lotus Elan is the dream, the reality of the bank holiday tends to be a little different – DIY. My dad was a builder and I remember him getting a Black and Decker workmate one Christmas.  He used that thing almost to destruction and I learnt a few carpentry skills on it as well.,I think mum liked it as well as it saved our chairs from being used as saw horses.,This is exactly what motivated the inventor of the workmate, the very same Ron Hickman who came up with the Lotus Elan, after he sawed into a Windsor chair! We have an early version right here in our collection. I can’t explain the excitement when I saw it for the first time and the flashbacks it triggered.,I love the fact that the designer of a high-end sport car also invented such a critical aid for the everyday man."

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/vintage-radio/,Charlotte Connelly,Exploring Our Vintage Radios,,"Collections and Objects,Exhibitions and Galleries","communication,information age","When I was asked to help develop ideas about early radio broadcasting for a proposed new gallery at the Science Museum I soon realised that I needed help to build up my knowledge quickly. I began with the usual resources – I read some books, looked online and scoured our collection for likely looking objects to explore. While all of these resources could provide me with a technical understanding of the history of radio, I struggled to get a grasp of what it must have felt like to have used early radio sets or listened to early broadcasts. It was time, I decided, to seek some expert help.,Several members of the
British Vintage Wireless Society
(BVWS) were already pencilled in to pay a visit to the Museum to look at the radios in our collection. It seemed like the perfect opportunity to recruit a few of them to work more closely with us. We knew we wanted to display one star object from the collection – the 2LO transmitter, which transmitted the very first BBC radio broadcasts in 1922. In addition we have a large collection of
radio receivers
from the 1920s and 1930s. What we were missing was a range of fascinating stories to help us choose between all those radios. We invited the members of the BVWS to help us select the stories that represented their experience and knowledge of vintage radios.,Five of the group offered their time, and I worked with a colleague to plan a series of four sessions for them. Over the course of the sessions the group got to know our collections and gradually built up their own set of criteria for selecting radio equipment. We asked them to arrive at a list of three objects each, meaning we would have a total of fifteen radio receivers as a long-list to work with.,As well as gathering a list of objects we were keen to collect stories about the historical impact of radios on everyday life. We also hoped to find out what led the members of the BVWS to be so enthusiastic about and enthralled with vintage radio equipment. They have a strong emotional attachment to these objects that would be brilliant to share with our visitors. We spent one of the four sessions at the
British Vintage Wireless and Television Museum
which holds an amazing collection of radios and televisions inside the walls of an innocent looking house in South London. While we were there, surrounded by all the fantastic objects in the museum, we interviewed some of the group and asked them about what got them collecting in the first place.,By the end of the four sessions we had a successfully arrived at a list of objects to display alongside the 2LO transmitter, together with stories to support them. One of the more unexpected items to make it onto the list was a ceramic mixing bowl selected by Lorne Clark. He told us how his mother, who had lived near a large transmitter, would place a pair of headphones in a mixing bowl in order to amplify the sound from a crystal radio set and make group listening possible.,The sessions were great fun and I certainly learned a lot about early radio from the group, and much more quickly and enjoyably than if I had been left to my own devices. Inviting outside groups to add their own expertise to the knowledge held by a museum and its curators can add a richness and variety to displays – especially as personal stories such as Lorne’s are often missing from a museum’s formal historic collections. Hopefully all of the BVWS members we worked with enjoyed their experience and gained an interesting insight into how a large museum goes about developing exhibition displays. I’m positive they enjoyed looking at our objects in storage because persuading them to leave the storeroom at the end of a session was always something of a challenge."

The Black Eyed Peas
frontman referred to his donation of £500,000, via his i.am angel Foundation, to
The Prince’s Trust
to fund education, training and enterprise schemes in the UK with a focus on technology and computer skills development.,The Trust is working with Toby Parkin of the
Science Museum
to enable it to engage young people with science. The museum currently reaches over half a million students per year through school visits and outreach. With the Trust, the museum will focus on inner city schools where children feel socially excluded and standards have been in decline.,Will.i.am says he wants his
initiative
to ‘help transform the lives of disadvantaged young people living in under-privileged neighbourhoods.’ He added that he was going to learn coding next year, though he stressed ‘I want to be in the classroom as well as the club.’,When I asked him if he wanted to come to the Science Museum to pass on his skills to the hundreds of thousands of children who visit each year, he joked it would probably take him eight years to get up to speed, or become what he calls ‘the rocking-est coder.’,Will.i.am is not alone in embracing geek chic. Earlier this year, the Hollywood actor and rapper Will Smith
told children in the Science Museum
that he had a hankering to become a computer engineer.,Will.i.am grew up in East Los Angeles, one of the roughest neighbourhoods in the United States, where his life could have turned out quite differently without the support of his family and a good education.,Because he feels London is his second home (‘it broke the Peas’), and because the city is at the forefront of fashion and culture, will.i.am decided to combine these passions with the launch of his device.,Called the i.am+ foto.sosho, it will turn an iPhone4/4s smartphone into a fashion accessory and a point-and-shoot digital camera with on-board editing, filters and social media connectivity that will be distributed by Selfridges.,After he came up with the idea in February of this year, during a meal in  the fashionable restaurant
Nobu
, he founded and self-funded the development and manufacture with experts located in China, Denmark, India, Singapore, the United Kingdom and the United States.,He also said that, by the end of next year, he wants to launch an X-Factor style spin-off show to give young people the chance to express themselves in science and maths so he can identify another technology entrepreneur of the stature of a Gates or Jobs."

Ask leading thinkers and you could end up worried yourself.  The latter was put to the biggest science minds for this year’s annual question –
What should we be worried about?
– from the good people at
Edge
.,Each year, this online literary salon poses a new question – previous examples include ‘
What is your favourite deep, elegant, or beautiful explanation?
’ and ‘
What will change everything?
’ – and requests that each contributor responds with a scientifically informed argument. The aim is to step away from the pressing news of the day, and share something new and thought provoking.,With this in mind it seems right to start with Larry Sanger’s
essay
, the co-founder of Wikipedia and Citizendium, which looks at the rise of internet silos. In Sager’s opinion, these online websites for news or opinion breed hostility and single mindedness by hosting ‘objectively unsupportable views that stroke the egos of their members,’ that make us ‘overconfident and uncritical’ about the world around us.,Continuing on the theme of modern technologies,
Nicholas Humphrey
,
Emeritus School Professor at the London School of Economics,
raises his concerns on
fast knowledge
. While many view today’s easy access to smartphones, search engines and the information that they provide us at the click of a button as a good thing, Humphrey argues the opposite. He
states
that nowadays, ‘everyone finds themselves going to the same places, when it’s the arrival and not the journey that matters, when nothing whatever memorable happens along on the way, I worry that we end up, despite our extraordinary range of experience, with less to say.’,In contrast to Sanger and Humphrey,
Simon Baron-Cohen
dissects an age old debate, that of C.P. Snow’s ‘Two Cultures’ from 1969. In his
essay
, Baron-Cohen recognizes the efforts of literary agents and publishers to make science more accessible, particularly to non-scientists, but states that in other fields of science, such as sex differences in the brain, these two cultures remain separated by a deep chasm.,Among these 140 contributors is one from our own Director of External Affairs,
Roger Highfield
, who
argues
the need for more science heroes to step forward, stating that ‘When it comes to selling the magic of science we need to accept that the most powerful way is through heroic stories.’ Highfield worries about the decline of scientific heroes, because their function as ‘viral transmitters of science in the crowded realm of ideas’ is of vital importance. He concludes that scientific literacy is vital for a modern democracy to function.,Other contributors, such as
Steven Pinker
, take an alternative approach, eliminating some of the problems that people fixate on. In Pinker’s case he looks at the causes of war, suggesting new and more relevant approaches to these worries.
Kevin Kelly
chose to turn the focus of a well known topic on its head, sharing the lesser-known worry of under-population.,And while reading all these essays may lead you to worry about many more things than you usually do, a common theme of these essays is the importance of sharing knowledge and challenging the status quo in today’s society, which is not such a bad idea after all.,Read more of what you should be worying about

lectures on  BBC i-Player
.,The RI’s Christmas Lectures began in 1825 and have continued ever since, pausing only during World War II. The roll of past lecturers includes such famous names as David Attenborough and Carl Sagan. But the person who’ll always be most associated with the Christmas Lectures is their founder
Michael Faraday

Such shows became a festive feature at institutions around the country.,The RI lectures aren’t the only festive legacy of the 19th century – the aforementioned Prince Albert is often credited with introducing the Christmas tree to Britain.

Jet cars

Rover ‘Jet 1’

An automotive engineer I met at a transport industry event told me about research now being funded by the
Technology Strategy Board

Jaguar Land Rover
, is to develop micro jet engines coupled to electrical generators, charging batteries that drive electric motors.,The concept is the same as hybrid cars such as the
Toyota ‘Prius
‘
,
but with a gas turbine rather than a conventional piston engine keeping the batteries charged. The trick, presumably, will be to balance a complex set of variables: power, weight, fuel consumption, size, cost and mechanical simplicity.,There’s also the
cultural meaning of the jet engine
, a potent symbol since the 1940s of British
defiant modernism
, an icon of
Harold Wilson

Museum of Science & Industry
in Manchester.,Speaking in the Museum at the official launch and celebration of Manchester as the
European City of Science 2016
, Europe’s greatest scientific gathering, the Chancellor set out further Government plans to
prioritise science investment in the North West
.,Mr Osborne said that it was ‘great to be back’ in the Museum, not just in an official capacity but as a local resident who visits with his children.,He told the audience of leading figures that Manchester was the first great scientific city in the modern world and that it was developing into a global force.,Today’s investment will allow the
Museum
to take forward ambitious plans to convert the brick-vaulted basement of its historic 1830 Warehouse – the first ever railway warehouse – into a venue for world-class exhibitions that will inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers.,This will help shift the centre of gravity of the Science Museum Group towards the north and enable the
Museum of Science & Industry
to develop its own touring exhibitions, along the lines of
Collider
. ‘It is a real pleasure to be here as a near local MP and someone who believes passionately in the future of the city,” he said.,Director Sally MacDonald said the investment would enable the iconic site to create a ‘really stunning’ gallery: “With the support of our partners, we want to develop ground-breaking exhibitions that can tour internationally, shining a global spotlight on our collections and our great city of Manchester.”,She hopes the new gallery will help boost the current audience of around 700,000 visitors by tens of thousands more. “This is a place where ideas can change the world, from industrial revolution to today and beyond.”,Today’s announcement comes just days after the Chancellor announced plans for a £235 million Sir Henry Royce Institute for Advanced Materials Research and Innovation at the University of Manchester. “I want it to be the best in the world,” he told the audience.,This, the centrepiece of investment plans for the region announced last week, will build on two centuries of innovation in developing materials that has underpinned Manchester’s rise as one of the first globalised industrial cities.,The £3 million Government investment in the Museum is in addition to an £800,000 grant that funded preparatory work, including the selection of the best location for the new exhibition space from across the Museum’s historic 7.5 acre site.,It was at the Museum’s Power Hall in June that George Osborne
announced his intention to create a “Northern supercity”
to rival London, New York and other major cities by building HS3, a high speed rail link between Manchester and Leeds.,At the launch was Professor Brian Cox, who still lectures in the university and conducted a bioluminescence experiment in the Museum for primary schoolchildren, along with the Chancellor. He remarked on how, over the past decade, more and more children were inspired by STEM.,Prof Cox laid down a challenge to all the political parties in the coming election to ring fence the science budget, or indeed increase it, to match the huge research budgets of Germany and America.,Prof Cox said that the UK can indeed be the best place in the world to do science, building on its infrastructure of world class schools, universities and museums. “I am extremely optimistic about the future.”,Sir Richard Leese, leader of Manchester City Council, said that the city has a tally of around 25 Nobel Prize winners. “Science is at the heart of Manchester, its past present and future,” he said, adding that around 50,000 people in Greater Manchester are employed in science and technology.,Manchester is the home of many world changing science achievements:
John Dalton’s
atomic theory of the 19th Century; the pioneering work of
James Joule
in thermodynamics;
Rutherford’s
work to reveal the atomic nucleus by smashing helium nuclei into gold foil;  the world’s
first programmable computer
in 1948; the
birth of Louise Brown
, the world’s first ‘test-tube’ baby, in 1978; and
in 2004 when Manchester made headlines with  ‘graphene’
an atom-thick wonder material.,That long history is celebrated throughout the Museum of Science & Industry and in its collections, ranging from
Richard Arkwright’s spinning frame
(1775) to the creation of
Terylene
, the world’s first wholly synthetic fibre (1941) , and the
isolation of graphene
just a decade ago.,The Museum is constantly innovating new ways to tell this story so as to make science accessible and enticing for its visitors, from its partnership with the largest STEMNET contract outside of London to the annual
Manchester Science Festival
.,The Museum’s major partnerships include relationships with the
Wellcome Trust
and the University of Manchester with whom the Museum is working on a new exhibition on graphene, which will open in 2016.,The Museum audience was also addressed by Rowena Burns, CEO of Manchester Science Partnerships, on the ‘limitless opportunities’ for life sciences in the region.  Plans for the European City of Science, “an unmatched opportunity to showcase our science and innovation to the world”, were outlined by Prof  Luke Georghiou, vice president for research and innovation at the University of Manchester; and Professor Colin Bailey, Vice-President of the University of Manchester, told the audience that the new Sir Henry Royce Institute will “ hit the sweet spot in the innovation chain of materials” to speed their delivery from lab bench to market."

Alphonse Laveran
and
Patrick Manson
. Laveran would later win the 1907 Nobel Prize for his work.,But he wasn’t the only one working on the subject – Giovanni Grassi was working on the life cycles of mosquitoes at the same time and came to the same conclusions as Ross. It is hard to determine who made the discovery first, but it is Ross’ name that is now attached to the mosquito/malaria story. Understandably, the rivalry between the two was bitter.,Ross worked mainly in India where he was born, in a primitive bungalow laboratory equipped only with a microscope to do his research.,,The only treatment for malaria at the time was quinine from
cinchona bark
. Ross’ discovery meant that the carriers of the disease, malaria, could be targeted for the first time.,A range of nets,
hoods

Roger Highfield,The one-ton Curiosity rover, suspended from the Sky Crane ‘rocket backpack’, touched down onto Mars first thing this morning to end a 36-week flight and begin a two-year investigation of the Gale Crater.,,Many missions to Mars have failed, such as Britain’s ill fated Beagle 2 mission,
a replica of which can be viewed in the Science Museum
.,However, the
Mars Science Laboratory
(MSL) spacecraft that carried the six wheeled rover, succeeded in the most complex landing ever attempted on Mars, including the final severing of the nylon bridle cords and flight of the Sky Crane  away from the landing site, according to the US space agency Nasa.,The most ambitious mission of its kind, and the largest ever to land on another planet, aims to help answer the question of whether there is life on Mars, though it will focus on finding the ingredients rather than life itself (not least because no one can quite agree on what life actually is),In 1854,
William Whewell
, a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, who popularized the word scientist, theorized that Mars had seas, land and possibly life forms. Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli speculated in his 1893 book, Life on Mars  that  there were channels on the surface (actually optical illusions created by the telescopes of the time),The term use used was “canali” in Italian, meaning “channels” but the term was mistranslated into English as “canals”, which suggested an artificial construction and triggered much speculation. In our Cosmos & Culture gallery, a Mars globe by Antoniadi, 1896-99 shows surface details named by Schiaparelli in 1877.,Among the most fervent supporters of the artificial-canal hypothesis was the American astronomer Percival Lowell, who spent much of his life trying to prove the existence of intelligent life on the red planet.  The search for life on Mars appeared to hit a dead end in 1976 when Viking landers touched down on the red planet and failed to detect activity.,There was a huge flurry of excitement a decade later, when
Nasa thought it had found evidence of life in a Mars meteorite
but doubts have since been cast on that finding, although meteorites may still hold
Important clues
.,Some still claim the Viking spacecraft may in fact have
encountered
signs of a life form however the debate will not end until there is direct evidence and Curiosity will search for conditions on the Red Planet that might enable  microbial life to thrive, which can endure extreme conditions.,Al Chen, an engineer on the rover’s entry, descent and landing team, said the words that space scientists had been awaiting for a decade: “Touchdown confirmed.” Applause erupted after images  arrived at Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in  La Cañada Flintridge. The rover itself tweeted an image of its shadow on
@MarsCuriosity
.,,“Today, the wheels of Curiosity have begun to blaze the trail for human footprints on Mars. Curiosity, the most sophisticated rover ever built, is now on the surface of the Red Planet, where it will seek to answer age-old questions about whether life ever existed on Mars — or if the planet can sustain life in the future,” said NASA Administrator Charles Bolden. “President Obama has laid out a bold vision for sending humans to Mars in the mid-2030’s, and today’s landing marks a significant step toward achieving this goal.”,Previous missions such as Vikings I and II and the Mars Phoenix Lander used retrorockets to lower spacecraft all the way to the surface atop a legged lander. Others, such as Beagle 2, have used airbags. Neither method is feasible for a rover of this size.,Curiosity landed around 6.30am but it took almost 14 minutes for the news to reach Earth. It settled down  near the foot of a mountain three miles tall and 96 miles inside Gale Crater, after the use of parachute, heat shield, 76 explosive bolts and sky crane, an eight rocket jetpack attached to the rover. It was billed by Nasa as ‘
seven minutes of terror
.’,Remarkably, an
image of the dramatic descent
was captured by the Mars Reconnaissance orbiter and by an onboard camera, which ends by revealing the plumes of dust sent up when the Sky Crane went into action. See
this composite video
of the simulated and actual descent, plus the scenes in mission control.,Curiosity returned its first view of Mars, a wide-angle scene of rocky ground near the front of the rover. About two hours after landing it transmitted a higher resolution image of its new
home
. More images are anticipated as the mission blends observations of the landing site with activities to configure the rover for work and check the performance of its instruments and mechanisms. For the latest images, check the mission
multimedia gallery
which includes the first
colour image
.,“Our Curiosity is talking to us from the surface of Mars,” said MSL Project Manager Peter Theisinger of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. “The landing takes us past the most hazardous moments for this project, and begins a new and exciting mission to pursue its scientific objectives.”,Curiosity carries 10 science instruments with a total mass 15 times as large as the science payloads on the
earlier Nasa Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity
. Some of the tools are the first of their kind on Mars, such as a laser-firing instrument for checking the composition of rocks from a distance.,The rover will use a drill and scoop at the end of its robotic arm to gather soil and powdered samples of rock interiors, then sieve and parcel out these samples into analytical laboratory instruments inside the rover.,Follow the mission on

The Raspberry Pi is a British designed device, roughly the size of a credit card and costing a miniscule £22. It has been designed to inspire a new generation of schoolchildren to learn about programming. As their
website
explains, the idea for this grew out of concern about, “the year-on-year decline in the numbers and skills levels of the A Level students applying to read Computer Science in each academic year.”,While this modest device could be set to revolutionise the way computing is taught in schools today, the Raspberry Pi Foundation is not the first organisation to want to improve our computer literacy. The 1980s marked a boom in personal computers, and many people became concerned that the UK would fall behind.
The BBC Computer Literacy Project
was launched on the 11th of January 1982, with the transmission of the television series ‘
The Computer Programme’
. At the same time, Acorn released a BBC licensed microcomputer, called the
BBC micro
.,By 1985 it had been adopted in 80% of UK schools, and along with a range of BBC educational software, was teaching a generation of children about the creative possibilities of computer programming. Today, this generation of programmers has grown up to populate a thriving computer industry in the UK. Places such as
‘Silicon Fen’
in Cambridge, and
‘Techcity’
in East London are known internationally as dynamic and innovative technology hubs.,In a new piece of research sponsored by the
National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts
(NESTA), the
Science Museum
is investigating the legacy of the BBC Computer Literacy Project, and the BBC micro. To do this we need your help!,Do you have experience of working in the computer and creative industries?

Curator Doug Millard looks back on the rocket that help start the space age.  ,"Collections and Objects,Exhibitions and Galleries","making the modern world,space,war","On 8 September 1944 Professor Jones and his colleague turned suddenly to each other in their Whitehall office and in unison said, ‘That’s the first one’. London had experienced four years of explosions from Luftwaffe bombs so this latest blast was hardly remarkable. But what they had noticed was the second bang following immediately after the first: a double detonation.,For over a year Jones, as Assistant Director of Intelligence (Science) at the Air Ministry, and his team had been assembling evidence for the existence of a new type of German weapon – one quite unlike anything developed before.,The bombs dropped during the blitz had been carried by manned aircraft; more recent attacks came from pilotless planes nicknamed doodlebugs or buzz bombs (on account of their leisurely flight across the sky and the staccato drone they made). Both could be detected on the way to their targets and warnings issued for the populace to seek shelter.,The new weapon gave no such warning: its exploding signalled that it had already arrived. It was a rocket that dropped from the sky at twice the speed of sound: one explosion was the warhead detonating; the other the sonic boom of the rocket’s arrival.,It had been developed at the Peenemunde research establishment on the Baltic coast line of Germany. Designated the
Aggregat 4
or A4, it was the latest in a series of new rockets designed by the German Army. It stood 14 metres high and weighed twelve and a half tonnes. It had a range of over 300 kilometres and touched space as it climbed to a height of 88 kilometres before dropping in a ballistic path on to its target. Joseph Goebbels renamed it
Vergeltungswaffe 2
(Vengeance Weapon 2), which was later abbreviated to V-2.,Thousands of V-2s were launched during the war, most aimed at central London. They steered themselves and could not be jammed with radio signals. So even when a rocket’s launch was spotted by allied forces there was nothing that could be done to counter its flight. The V-2 was the harbinger of the Cold War’s missile age and the four minute warning.,The V-2’s guidance was innovatory – it employed a system of gyroscopes that registered any deviation in flight – but by today’s standards the missile’s accuracy was very poor. Most landed kilometres off target. Nevertheless, it was clear to many that this new weapon represented a future of strategic warfare; one in which far more powerful missiles mated to nuclear warheads would cover intercontinental distances on the way to their targets. To others it signalled the
dawning of a space age
when still bigger rockets would counter the pull of gravity and place satellites in orbits around the Earth.,After the war the Allies acquired the V2 technology and many of the rocket programme’s leading scientists and engineers. The Soviets constructed their own version at the start of a research programme that led eventually their own R-7 rocket which put
Sputnik
– the world’s first artificial satellite – into orbit.,The Americans took many surplus V-2s along with the rocket programme’s technical director Wernher von Braun. The Redstone rocket that launched the first American into space was von Braun’s derivative of his V-2. Eight years later his massive
Saturn V rocket
launched astronauts Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins to the Moon.,The missile Jones heard had come down in Chiswick, west London. It killed three people and destroyed a row of houses. Over the next months many more were launched with most falling in south-eastern England and killing thousands of people (a map of V-2 rocket strikes across London and surrounding counties can be seen
here
). In a grotesque irony the V-2 killed many more in the course of its manufacture by slave labour from the Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp in central Germany.,The final V-2 landed south of London in Orpington on March 27, 1945 killing one person – the last civilian fatality of the war in mainland Britain.,For more information, visit the Science Museum’s

Double Helix: Discovering the structure of DNA.,Almost all frontiers of biological research in the 21st century owe their origins to the work of two Cambridge scientists (James Watson and Francis Crick) and their contemporaries at King’s College London (Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins).,Watson and Crick’s collaboration began in 1951, drawing on a range of evidence – including chemical techniques and X-ray crystallography – to determine the elusive structure of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). A breakthrough arrived when Watson was shown Rosalind Franklin’s X-ray crystallography photos of DNA, which clearly suggested a helical structure. As Watson wrote in his memoir:
‘The instant I saw the picture, my mouth fell open and my heart began to race’.,Understanding the structure of DNA, particularly how a sequence of simple nucleotides (A, C, G & T) can encode genetic information, has revealed ‘the secret of life’ – as Francis Crick announced in a Cambridge pub in 1953. A decade later, Crick, Watson and Wilkins were awarded the Nobel Prize for their work (Franklin missed out as Nobel prizes are not awarded posthumously).,Click

Games Jam

Hide&Seek
told us about three common pitfalls with live games – games that are too vague, to random or too complicated.
Vague games
lack clear instructions and clear goals for the participants,
complicated games
demand too much attention from players – asking them to absorb vast rule sets immediately and overly
random games
depend too much on chance – not giving your players enough of an opportunity to use their skills to influence the outcome.,Tassos Stevens from
Coney
talked us through the three principles that guide their games development – adventure, curiosity and loveliness.
Curiosity
is important because a good game should always have an element of newness,
adventure
because they need to be exciting.
Loveliness
is all about looking after your players and putting their experience at the heart of what you do.,He also stressed the importance of
playtesting
– creating a prototype as soon as possible so you can try it out, see what works and what doesn’t and change it. And then play again and change it again…,Matt Adams from
Blast Theory
took us on a whistlestop tour through lots of the decisions you have to make when you’re designing a location based game. What type of journey will you send people on? Linear? Disrupted? What duration, schedule? Is it played along or in a group, is there an advantage to collaborating, are there rewards, what happens if they get stuck, are there feedback loops so people can see if they are doing well, can people cheat, can that become part of the game?,Finally Simon Evans from
SlingShot
told us to
keep it simple
. There’s a finite number of game mechanics out there, so you can create something new and exciting by taking a familiar, existing model and deciding to
change one thing
. You’ve also got to
grab people’s attention
– something he’s achieved by orchestrating a tag-style
foxhunt game
where players get tracked through a city by real dogs. Possibly not one to recreate in the Museum.,Heads stuffed with inspiring stuff, we then had to get down to the mucky business of designing a game. More on that in the next post…"

Only a quarter of a century ago, but in that short time it has transformed our world. In a recent
Great British Innovation Vote
, musician Brian Eno
said
that ‘no technology has been so pervasive so quickly as the internet’.,On 12 March 1989, the British computer scientist Sir
Tim Berners-Lee
wrote his influential paper “
Information Management: A Proposal
” and circulated it to colleagues at
CERN
, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. Scientists from all over the world were brought together at CERN to conduct research, but Berners-Lee identified that there was a problem with the way information was managed and shared between them. His proposal suggested a way of linking documents through a system of hypertext.,Rather wonderfully, Berners-Lee’s boss, Mike Sendall commented that the proposal was ‘Vague but exciting…’ but he agreed to purchase a NeXT computer. The machine was to become the world’s first web server and Berners-Lee used it to build the
first ever website
. Today, the only evidence on the machine of its important history is a torn sticker that says: “This machine is a server. DO NOT POWER IT DOWN!!”,To celebrate the birthday of the Web, from today we are putting Tim Berners-Lee’s NeXT cube computer on display in our

What kind of Web do we want? Currently only 3 in 5 people across the world have access to the Web. Do we want a tool that is open and accessible to anyone?

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/celebrating-the-life-of-hertha-ayrton/,Dr Elizabeth Bruton,Celebrating the life of Hertha Ayrton,Dr Elizabeth Bruton explores the life of British physicist Hertha Ayrton who was born on this day in 1854. ,Science in the news,"stem,women in science,women in STEM","Hertha Ayrton
(1854-1923) was a British suffragist, physicist,,mathematician and inventor in a time when few women had access to opportunities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.,Ayrton was born Sarah Phoebe Marks in Portsmouth in 1854 to a relatively poor immigrant family of Polish origin.  Ayrton was supported in her education and professional ambitions, first by better-off family members and later the wider suffrage community – almost all of them women. Throughout her life, she was an active member of the suffrage community arguing for the right for women to vote.,Ayrton made important contributions to the study of electric arcs, used in the late 1800s and 1900s for large public indoor and outdoor lighting. Her work on the properties of electric arcs led to her being the first woman elected to the
Institution of Electrical Engineers, now the IET.
She was also the first woman to read a research paper at a
Royal Society
meeting.,Her later research into water and air vortices resulted in a life-saving application, the ‘Ayrton anti-gas fan’, a simple hand-held device used to clear poisonous chemical gases from frontline trenches during the First World War.,In 1863, when Ayrton was nine, she was invited by her maternal aunt Marion Hartog, who ran a school in north-west London with her husband Alphonse Hartog, to live with her cousins and to be educated with them. It was through her cousins that Ayrton was introduced to science and mathematics and by the time she was sixteen, she was living independently and working as a governess.,Ayrton had grander ambitions though and was determined to study at Cambridge University, despite the fact that the university did not award degrees to women.,In 1874, Ayrton passed the Cambridge University Examination for women with honours in English and Mathematics.  Two years later, Ayrton began studying mathematics at Girton College, one of the few all-female colleges at Cambridge University.  She was able to attend thanks to the financial support from fellow members of feminist and social justice communities, of which she was an active participant.,Ayrton was also an active member of the Girton College community: she was the leader of the College Choral Society, founded the college fire brigade and also founded a mathematics club.  Ayrton graduated with a third-class result in 1880, in part due to illness during her exams.  In 1881, she was awarded in external BSc from the University of London.,While studying at Cambridge, Ayrton began working on her first invention and patent, a line-divider.  A line divider is a mathematical tool and engineering drawing instrument and Ayrton patented the device after she graduated in 1884. It was the first of twenty-six patents she was granted during her lifetime.  The line divider was positively reviewed by users and in the scientific press but was not a commercial success.,In 1884 Ayrton began attending evening classes and studied electricity and physics at Finsbury Technical College in London. Ayrton studied electro-technics (electricity and physics) at the college where she was just one of three women studying alongside 118 men. Ayrton’s lecturers included physics expert and renowned electrical engineer Professor William Edward (Will) Ayrton.,The two were married in 1885, a year after they met. One year later, they had a daughter, Barbara Bodichon, named after Ayrton’s mentor and supporter.  In 1891, Ayrton’s mentor and her daughter’s namesake Barbara Bodichon died.  Bodichon left Ayrton a sum of money which enabled Ayrton to support her ageing mother and to hire a housekeeper so that she might dedicate more time and energy to her research.,In the early 1890s, Ayrton began researching the properties of electric arcs. At first, she began by assisting her husband with his research but soon she took over the research herself.,Thereafter, she made notable contributions to the development and understanding of the electric arc, an early and powerful form of electric lighting.,Ayrton established two key points in relation to the working of electric arcs. Firstly, she discovered that the problems with electric arc lighting such as hissing, flickering and instability were the result of oxygen coming into contact with the carbon rods used to create the arc.,Secondly, Ayrton discovered that when oxygen was excluded, a steady arc was obtained and hence she was able to establish a linear relationship between arc length, pressure, and potential difference, the ‘Ayrton equation’.,Between 1895 and 1896, Ayrton published a series of twelve articles on her analysis, research and technical advances in the field of electric arc lighting in
The Electrician
, the premier electrical engineering periodical of the age. With these articles, she overtook her husband’s earlier work in this field and established her own credentials as an expert on the workings of the electric arc and in the field of electrical engineering more generally.,This recognition led to increased opportunities including the invitation to deliver her own paper on electric arcs before the Institution of Electrical Engineers (IEE, now IET). She was the first woman to read her own paper before this prestigious engineering society.,In 1899, Ayrton was elected a member of the institution (MIEE), a prestigious and widely recognised professional qualification.  Thus, Ayrton became the first female member of the IEE and the first professionally recognised female electrical engineer.,Ayrton’s research interests were broad and at the turn of the twentieth century, her interests turned to researched water and air vortices, resulting in a life-saving application used during the First World War.,After the German Army first used poison gas at the Second Battle of Ypres in April 1915, many British scientists quickly began to adapt their research to counteracting this new and deadly weapon. In early May 1915 and shortly after the news of German use of gas had reached England, Ayrton presented a paper on differences in pressure near obstacles in moving water and began to consider how this might have practical application in terms of removing gas from the trenches.,Ayrton developed the ‘Ayrton anti-gas fan’, a simple hand-held device used to clear poisonous chemical gases from British frontline trenches during the First World War.  Ayrton’s anti-gas fan was simple and consisted of a sheet of waterproof canvas supported and stiffened by a frame of cane and held by a hickory handle.,By mid-May 1915, Ayrton had developed a working model which she tested out in her friend and fellow suffragist Ernestine Mill’s back garden in Kensington.,The War Office initially dismissed her invention but by 1917 Ayrton had developed an improved mechanical version of her fan.  After some delay, it was brought into use by the British Army and eventually over 100,000 Ayrton anti-gas fans were ordered.  The fans were used to clear trenches, dug-outs and shell holes, and mine craters of poisonous gases although there was some dispute as to their true effectiveness.,Throughout her lifetime and with the strong support of her feminist communities, Ayrton made an immense and diverse contribution to mathematics, physics and electrical engineering.,Her incredible life can be illuminated by three key artefacts: the 1884 patent for her line-divider; her article series on the electric arc published in The Electrician in 1895; and the ‘Ayrton anti-gas fan’ developed to combat trench gas during the First World War.,Spanning four decades and three subject areas – mathematics, electrical engineering and physics – these accomplishments demonstrate the deep impact Ayrton had on these specialist technical and scientific subjects as well as on the emerging roles available to women in engineering.,Further reading,Bruton, Elizabeth, 2018, ‘The life and material culture of Hertha Marks Ayrton (1854–1923): suffragette, physicist, mathematician and inventor’ in

","At the Museum,Collections and Objects,Exhibitions and Galleries","astronomy,History of science,science city,Science City 1550-1800: The Linbury Gallery,women in science","We have some particularly
fine telescopes
from the 17
th
and 18
th
centuries in our recently opened permanent gallery,
Science City 1550-1800: The Linbury Gallery
.,As well as some beautiful refracting telescopes in this gallery, we currently have
one of the very earliest reflecting telescopes
on display, generously lent by the
Royal Society
. It was made in the early 1670s by none other than
Sir Isaac Newton
and used mirrors to gather light, rather than lenses as found in refracting telescopes. In fact, Newton is often credited with inventing the reflecting telescope – but it’s worth remembering that contemporaries like
James Gregory
were experimenting with similar designs at this time.,Newton’s reflecting telescope mirrors were made from an alloy called speculum metal. Essentially a type of bronze, speculum metal has an unusually high tin content – typically about 30% – to give mirrors a suitably silvery, reflective surface.,It was a
notoriously difficult material for astronomers to work with
, being both brittle and prone to tarnishing quickly. But despite the inconvenience of having to frequently remove and repolish the mirrors, speculum metal remained the material of choice for reflecting telescopes well into the 19
th
century in the absence of suitable alternatives.,Astronomers experimented with different recipes for speculum metal over the centuries, but the two main ingredients were copper and tin. Newton added small amounts of arsenic to his, arguing that it made the metal whiter and more reflective. He did at least take some basic precautionary measures when melting this poisonous substance to make his alloy, ‘bewaring in the mean time, not to draw in breath near the pernicious fumes’ (
Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society
, vol. 7 (1672)).,We had a go at making speculum metal telescope mirrors – arsenic NOT included – as part of a “how-it’s-made” film for the
Science City
gallery. We wanted to showcase some of the extraordinary craft skills needed to produce many of the
historical scientific instruments
in our collection.,Making a historically sympathetic telescope mirror involves two key processes: first, the metal is cast in the shape of a disc; then, the surface of the disc is ground and polished to a smooth, accurate mirror finish. Speculum metal is now virtually obsolete as a material, but thanks to the virtuoso skills and tireless efforts of some truly talented contemporary artists, we were able to meet this somewhat unpredictable challenge head-on.,Artists
Necole Schmitz
,
Stephen Coles
and
Katie Surridge
took on the casting processes, melting the specially alloyed speculum metal in a chimney furnace at over 1000 degrees Celsius before pouring it into disc-shaped moulds.,Speculum metal might look light and fluid when it’s molten, but it’s actually very heavy: our resulting mirror disc – a modest 6 inches in diameter – weighed about 4kg! Still, that’s peanuts compared to the
6-foot speculum metal mirror
from the Great Rosse Telescope in our collection, which weighs in at over 4 tonnes…,Our mirror was cast with an almost imperceptibly shallow concave face – only about a millimetre deep in the centre. But that gentle curve is vital; millions of wavelengths of light hitting the mirror from myriad angles are then all reflected back to converge perfectly at a single point, producing a focused, blur-free image.,The mirror disc’s concave surface then had to be ground against another metal disc with an equally matching
convex
surface. This grinds out imperfections from the casting process to make the mirror smoother and more reflective and helps to grind a more accurate curve into the mirror.,Artist
Terry Kubecki Pearce
, an expert in hand-grinding telescope mirrors, was the man for the job. Nowadays telescope mirrors are made from glass which is ground into shape before receiving a reflective coating, but the hand-grinding techniques are similar to those that would have been used for speculum metal mirrors. In fact, metal mirror grinding itself developed out of the materials, tools and techniques used for grinding spectacle lenses and other forms of glass.,Terry ground the mirror against the convex disc using ever finer pastes of water mixed with sand, from coarse, gritty grades right down to ground pumice stone as smooth as flour. He then polished it to a high shine on a bed of slightly softened set pitch, or tar, with polishing powder. This is exactly what earlier astronomers did:
William Herschel
ground his speculum metal mirrors with coarse emery and water; Newton polished his on a bed of pitch while
John Hadley
similarly used pitch-soaked silk.,It may sound straightforward enough, but grinding and polishing a speculum metal mirror is not for the faint-hearted.
Caroline Herschel
, sister of William and herself an accomplished astronomer who went on to discover eight comets, wrote of her ‘attendance on my Brother when polishing, that by way of keeping him
alife
I was even obliged to feed him by putting the Vitals by bits into his mouth – this was once the case when at the finishing of a 7 foot mirror, he had not left his hands from it for 16 hours together’ (Michael Hoskin (ed.),
Caroline Herschel’s Autobiographies
(Cambridge, 2003) p. 55).,It took Terry over 20 hours of grinding and polishing to produce our mirror – and no, thankfully, he didn’t do it non-stop!,Our speculum metal mirror is about the same size as that for the reflecting telescope with which William Herschel
discovered the planet Uranus
in 1781 – the first planet to be discovered with a telescope. We have
a similar reflecting telescope made by Herschel
on display in the
Science City
gallery, as well as the mirror which we had specially made.,Whilst our museum is temporarily closed we encourage you to explore

he celestial phenomenon known as a supermoon
.
But what is a supermoon, and what causes it?,What is a supermoon?,A supermoon is a full or new moon that occurs when the moon is at a point in its orbit where it is closest to Earth. During a full supermoon, the moon appears up to 14% larger and 30% brighter than regular full moons. It can be hard to notice the difference when the moon is high in the sky, so the best time to look at a supermoon is when the moon is near the horizon and you can compare it to buildings, trees, and other landmarks
to see just how large it is in comparison.,Why do they occur?,The moon’s orbit around the Earth is not perfectly circular, but elliptical
(in other words oval), meaning
the moon’s distance from Earth varies throughout its orbit. The point in this elliptical orbit where the moon is closest to Earth is called the perigee
and it’s when a new or full moon occurs while the moon is passing through this point that we get a supermoon
,
otherwise known as a ‘perigee syzygy’
.,How often do they appear?,The moon takes a
round
27 days to
do a full
orbit of
the
Earth
and around 29 days to complete
one full lunar cycle (from new moon, to full moon, back to new moon).
The conditions of both these
cycles needed for a full supermoon – a full moon and a perigee – coincide about three times a year

So, dust off your SNES, grab your controller and let’s take a walk through the Mushroom Kingdom as we pay tribute to the infamous moustachioed man.,Here are eight unusual facts about Super Mario.,1. Mario wasn’t always called Mario,In the early stages of developing Mario’s character Nintendo originally gave him the name Jumpman. Creator Shigeru Miyamoto also toyed with the idea of calling him Mr Video before finally deciding to name him Mario after the landlord of their American Nintendo warehouse.,2. Mario was the bad guy,Mario, under his original name Jumpman, made his first appearance as a side character in the
cult classic Donkey Kong
game created by Nintendo in 1981. In this game, Mario mistreated his pet Donkey Kong causing the ape to kidnap his girlfriend.,3. Mario the Casanova,Princess Peach, previously known as Princess Toadstool, is widely known to be Mario’s main squeeze. However, before Peach joined the scene Mario was romantically involved with a character called Lady whose name later turned out to be Pauline. Pauline makes a re-appearance in a Gameboy remake of Donkey Kong but was unfortunately put in the friend zone by Mario. In 2013 a
games developer hacked
Donkey Kong, creating a version where Pauline saves Mario instead.,4. Not just your average plumber,We all know Mario and Luigi as Mushroom Kingdoms favourite plumbers, however, Mario has had a few career changes in his time. In Donkey Kong, Mario is a carpenter, but in other games, he is a medical physician, an archaeologist, champion kart racer, golfing aficionado and even the tycoon of a successful toy manufacturing company.,5. National Mario Day,10 March is National Mario Day, chosen because when abbreviated to MAR10 it resembles his name. In 2017, Nintendo celebrated MAR10 by working with Starlight Children’s Foundation to design new Super Mario themed hospital gowns for children.,6. The last cartridge,Super Mario Bros was meant to be the last cartridge game launched for the Nintendo Entertainment System console, or NES as it is often affectionately referred to. Nintendo wanted to make the switch to a floppy disk-based system that was already a success in Japan with the
Famicom
console. The popularity of Super Mario Bros led to cartridges being used for another two decades.,7. Mario makes a cameo,Mario makes appearances in countless other video games. Some of the strangest include Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 where you can find a copy of a game titled ‘Italian Plumber Princess Rescue’. Mario and Yoshi also make appearances in Metal Gear Solid and Legend of Zelda.,8. Knit-endo,Probably the weirdest product concept to come out of the Super Mario hype was the Nintendo Knitting machine which allowed you to create your own Nintendo knitwear. This product was based on an existing Japanese GameBoy game called Mario Family which connected your NES to a sewing machine. The Nintendo Knitting Machine never made to it production so unfortunately, you’ll have to knit your own Super Mario jumpers…,Experience the evolution of gaming for yourself at

Each page is printed with text about cleaning water and is embedded with silver nanoparticles, which are antibacterial.,When dirty water is passed through a page, bacteria in the water are killed by these tiny particles of silver. This got me thinking about nanoparticles and nanotechnology in general. Why are these small particles so useful? What makes them special?,Nanotechnology is…,Put simply, nanotechnology is technology on a small scale, working with atoms and molecules. Nanoparticles themselves are very small particles, the next size up on this scale.,Nanoparticles of a variety of different substances are now used in hundreds of consumer products.,So how small are we talking?,Nanoparticles and matter at this scale are measured in nanometres – 1 nanometre is 1 billionth of a metre.,The London Centre for Nanotechnology
describes nanotechnology as ‘a set of technological tools that rely on the ability to control matter precisely on length scales below 100nm’.,It’s hard to imagine how small this is when we’re talking about things you can’t even see. But a piece of paper is roughly 100,000 nanometres thick and the size of a gold atom is about a third of a nanometre.,Look for 1 nanometre and a carbon nanotube on
The Scale of the Universe
– you’ll find them next to DNA and atoms!,So nanotechnology involves working with things that are all very small. It crosses scientific disciplines including physics, chemistry, engineering and biology. Synthesising nanoparticles is a part of this type of research. It involves manipulating atoms and molecules to create man-made nanoparticles of particular sizes that don’t behave in the same way as larger particles of the same material.,How new are nanoparticles?,Nanoparticles were actually used by the Romans –
although they didn’t know it.
The Lycurgus Cup
– about 1600 years old – is an ornate glass cup that normally appears green. But when light is shone through it, it appears red because of silver and gold nanoparticles in the glass. Researchers think the people who made it ground down the silver and gold and mixed them with the glass when it was a hot liquid.,Nanoparticles are created naturally and come off larger objects all the time. What’s different about nanotechnology is that these particles are being deliberately made for specific purposes; they can be engineered in specific sizes and shapes, and if you make a lot of them they can be used for a variety of purposes including in clothing and as coatings and coverings.,Why are they in my socks?,When it comes to nanoparticles, their size is what gives them their special properties. For example, silver nanoparticles have longer-lasting antibacterial properties than bigger particles of silver. That’s why they can be used in socks, to kill bacteria and prevent bad smells.,Nanoparticles can be made of many different substances. Titanium dioxide can be a more effective ingredient of sunscreen if it’s present as nanoparticles rather than larger particles. Carbon nanotubes are useful because they are super strong.,The bigger picture,New nanotechnology is being developed all the time. Metals can be infused with nanoparticles to make them super strong and lightweight. Nanotech could be used to help combat climate change by creating lighter metals to reduce the weight of vehicles, increasing fuel efficiency, and in renewable energy technology.,Researchers are also studying what happens to these particles when they end up inside us and in the environment. At the
University of California’s Center for Environmental Implications of Nanotechnology
, researchers are looking at what effect silver nanoparticles might have when they end up in aquatic ecosystems. There are also organisations looking at the sustainable development and use of nanotechnology.,Whatever their results, nanoparticles have been around a long time and are here to stay. Where will they turn up next?,This post was originally published on 30 March 2016 in support of the Antenna Gallery at the Science Museum.,By Amy Pollak"

, CBE, was a pioneering British female pilot born in Yorkshire in 1903. On 5 May 1930, she set off from Croydon Airport in Greater London in her second-hand aeroplane, a
de Havilland Gipsy Moth
named
Jason I
, bound for Australia.,Two years prior, Australian aviator
Bert Hinkler
had become the first person to fly solo from England to Australia, completing the journey in just over 15 days – a new record time for the journey.,Johnson sought to match his achievement and become the first woman to complete the 18,000 km (11,000 miles) journey. Until her voyage to Australia, Johnson’s longest solo flight had only been from London to Hull, around 300 km (186 miles).,Johnson had planned the most direct route possible in the hopes of not only becoming the first woman to complete this voyage but to also break the record for the fastest journey time. This ambitious approach made her flight remarkably challenging; the direct route took her over inhospitable terrain and extreme landscapes, sometimes forcing her to fly for over eight hours at a time until a safe landing was possible. Scheduled refuelling stops along her planned flight path meant that following this route was essential, no matter what conditions she would come up against.,And she did indeed come up against extreme conditions: flying over Iraq, a sandstorm forced her to land in the desert, taking refuge until it passed. Amazingly, this did not prevent her from reaching India by 11 May in a record-breaking six days. She reached Myanmar (then Burma) just two days later, during monsoon season. Landing in the stormy weather damaged
Jason,
breaking the propeller and ripping a hole in one of the wings. Fortunately, a local technical college was able to repair the aircraft and Johnson could continue her journey, but this delay cost her the record for the fastest flight to Australia.,On 24 May 1930, Amy Johnson landed in Darwin, Australia. She was received by adoring crowds and then returned to England to a hero’s welcome, becoming something of a national treasure.,During the course of 1930, she was awarded the
Harmon Trophy
and a CBE in recognition of her achievements, and her impact was felt across the country. Ladies sought to channel her look, asking their hairdressers for the ‘Johnson wave’, the press covered her story with various nicknames like ‘Wonderful Miss Johnson’ and ‘The Lone Girl Flyer’, and several popular songs were written about her, such as ‘Amy, Wonderful Amy’ sung by Jack Hylton.,Johnson went on to set many long-distance records throughout the 1930s, including the solo flight record from London to Cape Town, South Africa, in 1932. She continued to be widely celebrated, becoming the youngest president of the Women’s Engineering Society in 1934.,Today, her trusty de Havilland
Gipsy Moth

carried her halfway around the world can be found in the Science Museum’s

From everyday things to specialist one-of-a-kind pieces of scientific,equipment, historical artefacts feel like a direct line to the past. Why else do we flock to museums in our millions to see them? This sentiment, or emotional response, is enhanced when we know the owner or user of such objects. This isn’t just a pair of glasses, these are John Dalton’s glasses. This isn’t just a space capsule, this is Tim Peake’s Soyuz capsule.,This was the feeling that I was almost overwhelmed by when reviewing the objects related to Faraday in the chemistry collections.,Faraday is heralded as one of the most famous scientists in
history
despite his humble origin as the son of an apprentice blacksmith on the edge of London, then the largest, richest and most powerful city in the world. Faraday attended
Humphrey Davy’s
lectures at the Royal Institution while training as a bookbinder. After Davy damaged his eyes in an explosion during his chemical research, Faraday was recommended to him as an amanuensis (assistant) in 1813.,Shortly after this one of Davy’s assistants was dismissed for striking another colleague and Faraday took up the position. Faraday worked for Davy until the latter’s death in 1829, with their relationship oscillating between patronage and exploitation. Davy put Faraday to work on several projects that would utilise his talent; the founding of the Athenaeum Club attempts to improve optical glass and the protection of the copper bottoms of naval vessels from corrosion while at sea.,Faraday was frustrated with the amount of time these projects consumed and the lack of practical success. In the 1830s Faraday was widely regarded as Davy’s successor in both scientific and public life and he was fully committed to the encouragement of state utilisation of science. Providing advice on a wide range of topics from lighthouses to art restoration, Faraday defined state interaction with scientific knowledge during a profoundly formative-era for state-science relations. The formally employed scientific advisor to the government, the Astronomer Royal George Airy, told Faraday “we trouble you as a universal referee or a character-counsel on all matters of science.”,Despite the absorption of his time on tasks and experiments set by Davy,,Faraday built up his reputation as a chemist at the start of his career. In the late 1810s Faraday conducted important metallurgical work on improving steel alloys with the surgical instruments-maker James Stodart. Faraday and Stodart addressed themselves to the specific question of ‘artificially’ improving cutting edges and decreasing corrosion by adding alloys to steel.,A few years after this work, Faraday isolated and identified benzene in June 1825 from the oily residue derived from the production of illuminating gas, giving it the name bicarburet of hydrogen. Benzene is a significant chemical, used in the manufacture of more complex hydrocarbons to produce plastics, of which billions of kilograms are made today.,Faraday’s alloys and chemical samples are all kept in his chemical chest and is one of the treasure of the Science Museum Group’s collection. It also contains gifts to Faraday from other chemists.
William Hyde Wollaston
who discovered the elements palladium and rhodium sent samples of these to Faraday, who stored them with his own metallurgical samples.,These precious metals offered to Faraday are held by the museum in our safe and include platinum coins from Russia, samples of cadmium and crystals of Bismuth which were also all owned by Faraday. On display in the
Making the Modern World
gallery there is a
bar of aluminium
given to Faraday by Napoleon III. Until the electrolytic process for its extraction was discovered, aluminium was an expensive curiosity and used to make expensive jewellery.,Faraday’s life has always been regarded as highly romantic in its rise from humble origins to a hero of scientific endeavour, his eminent discoveries and intellectual labours have become classical in their simplicity, perfection and universal significance. The chemical chest and other items belonging to Faraday were bequeathed to the Museum in 1908 and 1911 by members of his family and were displayed as relics of Faraday’s life and work.,There is a noble tradition of science biography stretching back to the 1600s and there has been a recent revival in biography as a historical practice both in universities and museums. But while curators are keen to feed a fresh hunger to understand the making of science through the making of scientists, we should always be cautious in how we come to remember and beatify scientific-lives.,The history of science is filled with fantastic individuals and their narratives are fascinating. Yet focusing too much on the heroes of science can blind us to contributions of assistants and technicians, something that Faraday himself would surely have been keenly aware of."

BT Tower
(previously known as the GPO Tower and the Post Office Tower), is an iconic and widely recognised communications tower standing at 189 metres tall including aerial rigging. It was opened by
Prime Minister Harold Wilson on 8 October 1965
and officially
opened to the general public in May 1966 by Postmaster General Tony Benn.,The tower once had a revolving restaurant and cocktail bar called the ‘Top of the Tower’, where visitors received
a certificate as proof of their visit
.  The tower also had
a shop where souvenir models
could be bought.  The restaurant and shop were both open to the public until 1981 when public access to the building was restricted for security reasons.,When it opened in 1965, the tower was the tallest building in the UK and it remained the tallest building in London until 1980 when the Natwest Tower was built.  It is an iconic building and is still widely visible throughout London.,Nonetheless, that BT Tower was once a classified location covered by the Official Secrets Act and so was not included on Ordnance Survey maps.,It was not until
February 1993 when Labour MP Kate Hoey
used parliamentary privilege to “reveal” the address and existence of the BT Tower, in part to show the ridiculousness of “seemingly trivial information that remains officially secret.”,But why was the BT Tower a classified location in the first place?  This is where a connection with
microwave ovens
comes into play.,Microwave communications,The concept of using a point-to-point microwave radio link network to increase telecommunications capacity in the UK began in the 1950s, first by the General Post Office (GPO) and later by its successor BT plc.,Between the late 1950s and the 1980s, tall line-of-sight towers throughout the UK used microwave radio signals to relay telephone calls, television signals, and military and civilian data.,So-called ‘microwave horns’ (see below) were fitted to a network of tall concrete towers, including the BT Tower in London, and used to relay directional signals from one tower to another to form a long-distance telecommunications network.,Microwave signals used part of the radio bandwidth that was not commonly used for communications and so was less prone to interference.  Microwave radio signals were however affected by weather or transmission over bodies of water, indeed anything that wasn’t ‘clear air’.  The microwave network was used to increase the UK’s telecommunications data capacity from the late 1950s through the 1980s.,But why was the BT Tower, part of a microwave network used almost entirely for telephone and new 435-line colour television, a classified location whose address could not be revealed or location shown on Ordnance Survey maps?,It is much discussed and debated to this day, but it is thought that the BT Tower had a connection with the UK’s Backbone, a planned microwave telecommunications network designed to provide secure communications between strategic government locations.  It has also been suggested that this network was designed to provide resilient communications in the event of nuclear war.,Independent of its more secret uses, microwave radio relay links including BT Towers provided a significant part of the UK’s telecommunications capacity until the 1980s when they were largely replaced by fibre optic cables, which have larger data capacity and are more reliable.,Today, the BT Tower remains a key part of the UK’s modern communications infrastructure – approximately 95% of the UK’s TV content has some connection with the BT Tower and the tower is integral to Premier League football broadcasts.,Sources and further reading,We take an exclusive look behind the scenes at the BT Tower:

), Higgs and Hawking joined us for a full day of public events on Tuesday.,The day began with
Professor Peter Higgs
answering questions from a lucky group of students from across the UK in our IMAX theatre – with thousands more watching the Guardian live stream online.,Higgs talked
about his scientific hero Paul Dirac (who went to Peter’s school), being nominated for the Nobel Prize and whether discovering the Higgs boson was a good thing for physics. “Do you expect me to say it’s a bad thing,” joked Peter.,I always found physics rather dull at school. Chemistry was far more interesting – Peter Higgs.,The afternoon featured a spectacular double-bill of science and culture, with novelist
Ian McEwan
and theoretical physicist
Nima Arkani-Hamed
in conversation and an audience with Stephen Hawking.,,Presented by broadcaster Martha Kearney, McEwan and Arkani-Hamed
shared their thoughts
on similarities and differences between the two cultures. Professor Arkani-Hamed explained that the gulf between arts and science is one of language, often mathematics, with McEwan discussing the obsessive element in science – the pursuit of something larger than ourselves – and it’s similarity to the arts.,I like to think of science as just one part of organised human curiosity – Ian McEwan.,It was a very rare treat, and a huge honour, to journey into time and space with Stephen Hawking.
Stephen shared
that the Science Museum was one of his favourite places, “I have been coming here for decades. And that simple fact, in itself, tells quite a story.”,He went on to discuss his early work on black holes (Hawking
would like
the formula he wrote to be on his memorial) and the information they contain, “Information is not lost in black holes, it is just not returned in a useful way. Like burning an encyclopaedia, it’s hard to read.”,Hawking finished his talk with a plea to us all to be curious.,“The fact that we humans, who are ourselves mere collections of fundamental particles of nature, have been able to come this close to an understanding of the laws governing us, and our universe, is a great triumph.,So remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and hold on to that childlike wonder about what makes the universe exist.”,As the day ended, the recent Nobel Prize winner and our most famous living scientist were given a tour of

","Collections and Objects,Exhibitions and Galleries","medicine,secret life of the home","For pretty much as long as people have had hair they have looked for ways to change it. Inventions such as curling tongs feel relatively modern but they have actually been around for centuries.,We only have to look at paintings and carvings from the ancient world to see that having curls was a fashion that crossed many cultures. Babylonian and Assyrian men dyed their hair and square beards black, then crimped and curled them with basic curling irons. Persian and Greek nobles also used rods of iron or bronze heated over a fire to produce impressive hairstyles which would highlight their wealth and beauty. Egyptian nobles often cropped their hair close or shaved their heads but on ceremonial occasions, for protection from the sun, they wore wigs. The wigs would be long and full of curls or braids, which were styled with tools like this one.,These
bronze curling tongs
are combined with a hair trimmer and would have been heated up on a fire before pieces of hair were curled around them.,In the 1890s tonging became very popular as hair was elaborately styled on top of the head often with loose curls or ringlets around the face. Books and
articles
with instructions were written about the arrangement of hair to emphasise a woman’s beauty, and upper-class women were expected to follow these guidelines.,The fashion wasn’t just for the very wealthy anymore though as the emerging middle-classes tried to emulate the style. Curling tongs still resembled those from Ancient Egypt, and many accidents resulting in burnt or damaged hair occurred as the heat of the metal tongs was difficult to control.,With the advent of electricity, curling tongs started to resemble those we use today. Curling tongs were invented which could be plugged into a light socket which meant more temperature control and less scorched hair! By the mid-twentieth century, there were many varying designs, so much so that the definitive inventor of the modern curling iron is much disputed. They now come in many sizes and styles depending on the type of curls you desire from tight ringlets to loose waves or even crimped styles. Everyone now has the freedom to express themselves by styling their hair in an infinite variety of ways and as technology develops who knows what new tools may be invented.,What hairstyles do you think will be in fashion in 50 years time?"

Soviet Union’s Mars 3 spacecraft carried out the first successful landing on the surface of Mars.
And on that same day, millions of miles away back on Earth, one of the newest space-faring nations –
the United Arab Emirates (UAE) – was born
. Now, almost half a century on, the UAE is about to launch its own spacecraft to Mars. It is called Hope.,The name is not a wishful expression, although all space missions require faith that they will reach their destination. Rather, Hope is a signal of optimism to young people in the Emirates and beyond of what can be achieved when people come together and work on a scientific challenge.,Hope is set to launch from
Japan’s Tanegashima spaceport
on 15 July 2020 and will spend over six months making the 60-million-kilometre journey to Mars. It will then start to orbit the planet to study its atmosphere.,The main scientific objective for Hope is to find out more about Mars’ climate and how it has changed over billions of years; Mars used to be wet, like Earth, so where did the water go?,By focusing on the planet’s atmosphere Hope’s three scientific instruments aim to tell us more about how the once thick and moist atmospheric layer has degraded into the thin and dry condition it is in today.,There seems to be something about Mars that draws the human spirit. We have peered at it for millennia, puzzled over its wandering path in the heavens, assigned it mythical status and even worshipped it as a deity. More recently we have speculated on life forms that might dwell there – intelligent and advanced or microscopic and primitive. So far, for better or worse, there is no firm evidence that life has ever existed there.,Over the years, our robotic emissaries have flown past the planet, dropped into orbits around it – as Hope will – landed on the surface, and even driven around on it. In 2021, China’s
Tianwen-1
aims to put a rover on the red planet’s surface and a satellite into orbit and
NASA plans to deposit a rover on Mars along with a small helicopter
to explore the planet’s tenuous atmosphere.,Our world is truly visiting another and it is an international endeavour as Hope’s scientists have been working with colleagues in the United States and with engineers in Japan. Space is a unifier, showing how collaboration and team effort can achieve great things.

Daily Telegraph
suggesting that whilst road deaths are on a general downwards slope, drink-driving deaths were up last year. The report then brings up the perennial debate about
speed cameras

Cars and trucks are big, heavy and fast, so road safety – for passengers and pedestrians – has been the subject of life-saving innovation for decades.,On display in the museum, we’ve got plenty about road safety. Here’s the first

There’s no driver in the four-seat cabins – they’re controlled by lasers bouncing off an external guideway and feedback tells the pod to steer as necessary.,It’s a sophisticated new take on a fifty-year-old concern. The

Wroughton
storage facility during the Festival of Innovation on 12 and 13 September.,The RRL chose this Citroen because its revolutionary hydraulic steering, braking and accelerator system lent itself very well to automation. An electric cable buried in a test track in Berkshire was fed with a high-frequency signal which was picked up by sensors in the car, telling the control systems what to do.,Apparently the car was perfectly happy travelling at 80mph, even around curves, and one RRL report outlines a glittering future where, by 2010, all vehicles on all major UK roads would be automated.,Following the 1960 tests on the 2.5 mile RRL track, the engineers laid a 9 mile control cable under the new
M4
near Reading to carry out longer trials. It was abandoned once the M4 opened to public traffic, but I wonder if it’s still there, buried and forgotten?,The reports did recognise that it was human factors, not technology, that would limit motor car automation. We routinely trust

recently
about battery-powered electric vehicles, but the big story right now is the hybrid car, which combines both a petrol engine and a battery-driven motor. They’re pretty complicated, but the HowStuffWorks tutorial
here
explains it clearly. The idea is that they’re more fuel-efficient than purely petrol cars, thereby reducing climate-changing emissions.,But the concept has a long history – albeit with different aims in mind. In the early years of motoring, for instance, one big problem with petrol cars was changing gear. Until transmission technology improved, it was a real challenge to shift up and down. One solution was this petrol-electric hybrid, in our stored collection:,It’s a Fiat car, modified in 1927, in which the petrol engine drives an electric generator which powers a motor. The motor drives the wheels. There was no complicated gear-changing needed. This is the same principle as
diesel-electric locomotives
, for example, so whilst it didn’t catch on in cars (gear-changing technology advanced quickly) it’s still used today on our railways.,Another type of hybrid, which is seeing renewed development, is the
fuel-cell car
. Here, the engine is replaced by a fuel cell, which takes in a hydrogen-based fuel and air, generating electricity. The electricity again drives the wheels through a motor. This
Daf 44
family saloon was modified in the late 1960s as an experiment, but it was really heavy and didn’t make it into production:,Now, all eyes are on further possible alternatives to the petrol or diesel car. One thing’s for sure: they’re taking a long time to develop!"

, Triumph designer, was being honoured at a
blue plaque unveiling
in Peckham, London. That explained it.,Turner designed the Ariel
‘Square Four’
motorbike in the late 1920s, released at the 1930 Motorcycle Show. It was a very popular bike and stayed in production until 1959 – a remarkable achievement. In our reserve collection at
Wroughton
we’ve got a Square Four and a sectioned engine:,Fresh from this success, Turner moved to
Triumph
in 1936 as their Chief Designer and General Manager, staying until retirement in 1964. Here, he designed a variety of motorcycles, including the
‘Speed Twin’
, one of the most successful British motorbikes of all time. We’ve got a sectioned engine in store:,Now, I think things like sectioned motorbike engines are wonderful. It kind of goes with the territory. You’ve already seen how excited I get about
spark plugs
. But I must concede that they aren’t to everyone’s taste. No matter. We’ve got something for everyone, and now you can search our
catalogue online
.,If engine cylinders don’t bore you, we’ve got quite a lot of other
Triumph stuff
tucked away in the collections. Or maybe motorbikes don’t float your boat, but you love
toasters

",Collections and Objects,"art,astronomy","Museum objects are not always what they seem, as this intriguing embroidery – currently on display in our
Cosmos & Culture exhibition
– shows.,The label on the frame says that it shows an astrologer forecasting the birth of a child to
King Charles I
and his Queen, Henrietta Maria. It’s also been suggested that the face rising from the frames is a tad beardy for a newborn and that the scene may forecast Charles’s execution.,The astrologer is surrounded by a circle of planetary and Zodiac symbols, with knowledge symbolized by astronomical and mathematical instruments. More arcane practices are hinted at by the crocodile (often found hanging in apothecaries’ and alchemists’ shops), and a cat, the symbol of witchcraft.,The label dates the work to 1621. But when our eagle-eyed conservator noticed that the netting on the Queen’s dress looks suspiciously machine-made, we started digging deeper. And the more we looked, the odder this object seemed.,The embroidery has 22 sequins, all of regular shape and glued rather than sewn on. This suggests they were added in the 19
th
or 20
th
centuries rather than the 1620s. Of course, the netting and sequins could be later additions or repairs made to a 17th-century object. But the style of the embroidery itself suggests otherwise.,Charles I is shown wearing a ruff and petticoat breeches  – dapper no doubt, but around 30 years ahead of the fashions of the 1620s. His face is painted, very unusual for embroidery of this period.,And a final clanger for the 1621 date: Charles and Henrietta Maria didn’t marry until 1625.,The font on the label suggests it was added around the 1930s before the object came to the Science Museum. Wishful thinking by a collector? Or deception by a seller trying to get a better price?,We’re intrigued to find out more … and maybe our

will throw up some new information about this and other objects in our astronomy exhibition."

, it all became clear. For the competition, we’re releasing data about more than 100 objects from our astronomy collection for people to incorporate into their own websites. We asked the event guests to build their own linking stories through a selection of the objects. The final result looked a bit like Jackson Pollock had gone crazy, but there were some great stories.,As to those links: the photographic instrument, which rejoices in the grandiose title of The
Kew Photoheliograph

prominences
are part of the Sun’s surface. And the
tea towel
is one of many delightful (or delightfully tacky, depending on your point of view) souvenirs of the 1999 eclipse. Throw in a
photograph from the 1919 eclipse expedition
to Brazil that backed up Einstein’s general theory of relativity, and you’ve got a story about eclipse-chasing and the science we’ve learned from expeditions.,Another string connected Newton’s telescope, the dark matter detector,
gravitational waves
and that 1919 eclipse photograph again. They’re all steps in the story of our understanding of gravity.,Other threads picked up on the tension between religion and science, homemade tools, extraterrestrial life, and the
Herschel family

fantastic performance
from our very own ‘Caroline Herschel’.,If people can find that many different stories from the 20 or so objects we’d shown on the wall, imagine what they can do with the 100+ in the whole

Galileo Galilei
trained his telescope on Jupiter and spotted what looked like three stars nearby.,The next night he looked again, and the stars had changed position. Tracking their motion over the next week, he established that there were four of these ‘stars’, and they were in fact moons orbiting the planet.,In March 1610 he published his observations in
Sidereus Nuncius
(The Starry Messenger). It was a small book – if you get a chance, you can visit the

a huge impact
.,Since then, many more telescopes have turned towards the Solar System’s biggest planet – this beautiful lithograph by

named after Galileo
. This close-up of the
Great Red Spot

Voyager 1
in 1979.,Next year, NASA is heading back to Jupiter, with the
Juno
mission. But you’ll have to wait a while for the first images from the snappily-titled JunoCam, as the spacecraft won’t get there until 2016. In the meantime, why not take a look yourself?,Jupiter is visible to the naked eye, and if you’ve got access to binoculars or a small telescope you’ll see the Galilean satellites. So if you want to follow in Galileo’s footsteps tonight, Jupiter is best seen shortly after sunset from the UK, although your observations might be scuppered by snow! If you’re reading this from the southern hemisphere (surely this blog has achieved global domination by now?!) you need to look shortly before sunset.

Science Museum
for its then-new Land Transport gallery. Cuneo painted it in the gallery itself, surrounded by locomotives, cars and bikes all shrouded in protective sheeting prior to the opening.,The view is the same as that taken by artist
Helen McKie

Trinity House
provided navigation aids, and one of the most iconic is the
lighthouse

arc lamp
, in which two carbon electrodes pass electricity across a tiny gap, causing a bright arc of spark.,The light was too bright for domestic living rooms, but perfect for lighthouses, and one of the first to be fitted with electric arc lighting was

Fresnel
lens system, in which the light is focused and directed by concentric rings of prisms. This makes them much lighter than one-piece lenses (though the glass in the Eilean Glas optic alone weighs three tons) and more powerful beams were made possible, saving lives at sea.,Bella Bathhurst’s book
‘The Lighthouse Stevensons’

A few years ago I examined the Museum’s Beta 1 – a late 1940s rocket engine – and spotted the letters ‘T STOFF INLET’ inlet stamped on one of the valves.,This British engine was a precursor to those used on the
Black Arrow space rocket
and I knew of its German ancestry but was still delighted to find clear evidence preserved on the artefact (T Stoff was the German term for hydrogen peroxide oxidiser).,Of course, the problem with many museum objects is that they have to be kept behind glass.,The
Apollo 10 command module
– one of the
Museum’s Centenary icons
– is rather fortunately not enclosed but has still to be physically isolated from the visitor with a barrier and from air-born dust by Perspex covers over the hatch and docking port.,So for one day only in May of 2009, to commemorate the mission’s 40
th
anniversary, we sought permission from the spacecraft’s owner – the Smithsonian Institution’s
National Air and Space Museum
– to VERY CAREFULLY allow people up close to peer inside the spacecraft.,It took a lot of organising, but it was wonderful to see the reactions of the very young visitors who, with help from mum or dad, enjoyed looking in at the truly space-age control consoles of the spacecraft.,They could just about make out the hurried pencil jottings that the astronauts had made near their computer console. They’d probably been working out some bearings or the timing of a rocket engine burn. As the astronauts say themselves: if you want to be an astronaut you need to work hard at school and do the maths!"

House of cards
(2010) and Tony White’s downloadable novel
Shackleton’s Man Goes South
(2013).,So, why has art played such an important role in the Science Museum’s exploration of climate science and sustainability? The ability of artists to offer a unique and creative perspective on this challenging subject and to make visible the forgotten or intangible aspects of the world around us is the key.,The Rubbish Collection
is an excellent example of this. Sofaer’s concept is deceptively simple: get people to look at what they throw away and consider what happens to it next. It’s certainly not the way a curator would have tackled this topic; it has taken an artist to think the unthinkable and invite Science Museum visitors to help sort piles of rubbish.,Sofaer is cleverly utilising and playing with the recognisable role of the Museum, in collecting, sorting and displaying precious objects, and using them to tell stories. Rather than looking outward, to examine the material production of the world around us, we will be looking at what the Science Museum itself produces in the form of waste and exposing the value of these overlooked materials, both in aesthetic and monetary terms.,The concept is surprising – and in some ways utterly absurd – yet the outcome has the potential to shock as Sofaer brings us face to face with the reality of our daily consumption and waste of resources.,The Climate Changing…

The Rubbish Collection
certainly fulfils this brief. In the run up to the exhibition it has already stimulated conversations within the Science Museum and it is exciting to know this self-reflection will have an impact on the future decisions the institution makes in relation to sustainability and climate change.  As Project Curator of

Since November, the north bank of the Thames has been illuminated by her winter commission for Tate Britain ‘Remembering a brave new world’. Also conceived to celebrate Diwali, her vibrant work has been a much-needed moment of light and joy in a lockdown month, but also argues for the importance of Indian traditions within British identity.,Burman has also illuminated our work at the Science Museum Group. In 2017, she worked on a major new commission for our Illuminating India season, which told the stories of the Indian innovators and thinkers who have often been overlooked or written out of Western narratives of history. Her works are now part of the
permanent collection
and have since featured in Burman’s solo show ‘Tales of Valiant Queens’ at Middlesbrough Institute of Art in 2018.,Burman was commissioned to produce a piece for the space outside of the two exhibitions that made up the Illuminating India season: 5000 Years of Science and Innovation and Photography 1857-2017, but particularly to respond to India’s central role in the history of science and technology.,She created a stunning salon hang of 29 works, using her trademark mix of print, collage, painting and kaleidoscopic iPad drawings with glittering additions. These celebrate themes and achievements in Indian science within a broader cultural, political and religious history.,As with her Tate Britain commission, every element in Burman’s ‘India Illuminated!’ collection has a reason behind it. Works celebrate the number zero, first recorded in Indian mathematics by Brahma Gupta in the seventh century CE, and three medical instruments based on early Ayurvedic texts.,The Indian flag appears behind a charkha: a traditional Indian spinning wheel, which is now strongly associated with independence leader Mahatma Gandhi’s arguments for an Indian economy based on cottage industries.,﻿
﻿,Elephants appear strutting through a number of works to tell an important environmental message. Nature reserves protecting species including elephants were established by Emperor Ashoka in around 250 BCE, and efforts put in place by the Mughal Emperor Akbar in the sixteenth century are credited with ensuring the survival of Indian elephants today.,Burman chose to include figures and symbols from all a range of Indian religions within her collection: Sikh, Zoroastrian and Buddhist alongside a number of Hindu gods. Parvati, in particular, appears in multiple works, especially apt as she also manifests as Saraswati, goddess of learning, and therefore science and wisdom. Burman considered reusing one of our images of Parvati in the Tate commission.,Also featured is a copy of Burman’s personal kundli (also known as a panchanga), which is an astrological horoscope and almanac that predicts a person’s trajectory through life.,If Burman’s trajectory since working with the Science Museum is anything to go by, she will be illuminating our vision and thoughts more and more in the future.,Don’t miss her extraordinary winter commission at Tate Britain until 31 January 2021."

For Science
creates a space of rest and reflection for visitors exploring ‘Faith, Hope and Fear’, one of five interconnected galleries that make up
Medicine: The Wellcome Galleries
. Made from Silver Cloud granite, the work comprises two stone benches with texts sandblasted into their seats. The stone evokes a monument or memorial, which speaks to discussions elsewhere in the gallery of how we think about death and dying.,The title ‘Faith, Hope and Fear’ refers to the gallery’s focus on the emotional impact of medicine and the objects, people, ideas, and beliefs to which we turn when facing illness and the disruption it brings.,It considers how our ideas of health and disease are shaped by our social and cultural backgrounds, and acknowledges that modern medicine is one of many approaches people take (and have taken, in different times and places) to managing the unpredictability of sickness and treatment.,Holzer chose the texts to be inscribed into the benches in consultation with the museum team. They originate from two diverse authors who both experienced cancer diagnoses and whose influential writing about illness she describes as “expansive and frank”: Susan Sontag and Paul Kalanithi.,American philosopher Sontag wrote Illness as Metaphor (1978) while being treated for breast cancer. Her opening lines, “
Illness is the night side of life
” introduce the idea that we have citizenship of two countries throughout our lives – the realms of the well and the sick – and our ‘residence’ in one or the other profoundly affects our own and society’s perceptions of us. The book highlights how the language we use to describe certain diseases can result in stereotyping and stigmatisation of patients.,From her background as a cultural critic, Sontag called for a rejection of metaphor and cultural understandings of illness in favour of empirical science and its objective focus on causes and treatment. Others have disputed this position, contending that metaphor is one of the main ways in which human beings make sense of the world.,Kalanithi’s complex question “
What kind of life exists without language?
” comes from the memoir, When Breath Becomes Air (2016), published soon after his death from lung cancer.,Kalanithi was used to every tiny movement he made as a neurosurgeon presenting huge potential implications for the patient; his profession laid bare the extraordinary delicacy of cognitive functions such as emotion, memory, and language.,Kalanithi’s diagnosis transformed his perspective from doctor to patient and led him to reflect on the ethical decisions at the heart of his work. The quote Holzer selected refers to the significance of language for meaning in human relationships.,Kalanithi studied English and philosophy before pursuing his medical career and recognised the importance of both disciplines to his chosen field.,Holzer’s benches join an important and growing body of works by female artists in the collections of the Science Museum Group. Within ‘Faith, Hope and Fear’
For Science
is in conversation with Eleanor Crook’s sculpture Santa Medicina (also on display in the galleries) which likewise draws, albeit in very different ways, on material and social histories of medicine.,Elsewhere in Medicine: The Wellcome Galleries, Siân Davey’s life-size portrait photographs similarly bring different voices to bare on experiences of medicine. Another highlight of the collection is Barbara Hepworth’s Surgery Sketchbook from 1948, the only surviving sketchbook from a two-year period that the artist spent intimately observing surgical procedures.,Holzer’s work was commissioned to mark a year since the opening of the Medicine Galleries. It has not been the year that any of us could have anticipated, but has certainly emphasised the importance of society, community, and empathy in how we understand our medical experiences.,In resting on these works, touching, reading, and discussing the words, we hope that visitors will find a place to pause and take stock."
https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/the-spirit-of-alan-turing/,Roger Highfield,The Spirit Of Alan Turing,"The tragic loss of a friend during his teenage years exerted an extraordinary influence on Turing’s life, according to Roger Highfield and David Rooney.","Collections and Objects,Exhibitions and Galleries","alan turing,computing,untold stories,war","The defining moment of the remarkable life of Alan Turing, one of Britain’s most original thinkers, came much earlier than many realise. It was not while Turing cracked Nazi codes at
Bletchley Park
to change the course of the Second World War. Nor when he lay the mathematical foundations of modern computing. Or that instant when, during a 1951 visit to the Science Museum, he was fired up by the lifelike behaviour of a cybernetic tortoise.,The Museum’s Turing exhibition, which marked the centenary of his birth in 1912, showed that the signature moment of Turing’s life came on February 13, 1930, with the death of his classmate, Christopher Morcom, from tuberculosis. This shattering event propelled the great Turing through a
remarkable career
.,Morcom was Turing’s first love, a fellow, older pupil at Sherborne School, Dorset, who shared Turing’s passion for mathematics. Though Turing’s crush was not reciprocated, he was profoundly affected by the death of his friend. In a contribution towards an anthology for Morcom’s grieving mother, which is on display in the exhibition, Turing admitted that he ‘worshipped the ground he trod on’.,Morcom’s death cast a long shadow. Turing turned away from his Christian faith towards materialism, and began a lifelong quest to understand the tragedy. As he struggled to make sense of his loss, Turing pondered the nature of the human mind and whether Christopher’s was part of his dead body or somehow lived on.,Alan Turing is often portrayed as an isolated genius, even a borderline Asperger’s loner. This traditional depiction is, perhaps, a weak reflection of homophobia of recent decades. But read about his feelings for Morcom, his letters and the correspondence of those close to him and you obtain a more complete portrait. Far from being the insular genius of popular belief, Turing could be warm and gregarious, though he did not suffer fools gladly and had an original take on the way he lived his life as much as he conducted his science.,The October after the loss of his friend, Turing went up to Cambridge, where he studied mathematics. Our exhibition includes an essay, entitled “Nature of Spirit” that Turing wrote the next year, in 1932, in which he talked of his belief in the survival of the spirit after death, which appealed to the relatively recent field of quantum mechanics and reflected his yearning for his dear friend.,Around that time he encountered the Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics by the American computer pioneer,
John von Neumann
, and the work of
Bertrand Russell
on mathematical logic. These streams of thought would fuse when Turing imagined a machine that would be capable of any form of computation. Today the result – known as a universal Turing machine – still dominates our conception of computing.,Turing’s struggle to solve the codes of thought paved the way to his interest in cryptanalysis, the study of how to crack ciphers. Around the time of the Munich agreement in 1938 Turing began to help the UK government with the problem of deciphering German communication and this interest would culminate in an extraordinary effort during the Second World War when he worked for the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park.,There Turing would break the codes of society too. In 1941, Turing had proposed marriage to Joan Clarke, a fellow cryptanalyst, but decided he could not go through with the marriage after admitting his homosexuality to his fiancée, who was reportedly “unfazed” by the revelation.,Turing’s greatest challenge at Bletchley was the German enciphering machine, Enigma, three of which are on show in our exhibition (including one kindly lent by Sir Mick Jagger). He took particular responsibility for reading U-boat communications and led a team that designed the great ‘bombe’, a calculating machine that successfully decoded Germany’s wartime messages. Eventually, over 200 were built, each weighing a ton, that made the noise of a ‘thousand knitting needles’ when in full flight.,The breaking of the Enigma was vital, partly because it meant that the Allies could intercept messages to the U-boats that were attacking convoys, sinking merchant ships and threatening to isolate Britain. It’s even been claimed that, without Bletchley Park’s contribution, the war might otherwise have been lost.,At that time a ‘computer’ was not a machine but a person, often female, who did calculations by hand. Machines were used too, but only for defined jobs, such as aiming bombs or solving differential equations. Combining his ideas from mathematical logic, his experience in cryptology, and the remarkable code cracking machinery of Bletchley, Turing’s ambition was to create a computer in the modern, electronic, flexible sense.,He joined the
National Physical Laboratory
, NPL, in Teddington in 1945 where his detailed – and world-beating – plan for an electronic computer was accepted in March 1946. But by then his remarkable wartime achievements were a state secret and he was not taken as seriously as he deserved. Frustrated, Turing resigned in 1948 though eventually, in 1950, his ideas came to life at NPL in the form of the
Pilot ACE computer
, which is the star of the Museum’s Turing exhibition.,The machine was the fastest in its day. This remarkable testament to Turing’s inventive capabilities was in huge demand. Within the exhibition we show two vivid examples of how this pioneering machine was used: to reveal how metal fatigue caused the loss of BOAC Flight 781, a de Havilland Comet jet airliner; and the Nobel prize winning work by Dorothy Hodgkin to use X rays to unravel the molecular structure of Vitamin B12.,On Midsummer Day 1948, the first prototype general-purpose computer, a true universal Turing machine, went into action at Manchester. And it was at Manchester University, when Turing was Deputy Director of the computing laboratory, that he wrote his highly influential 1950 paper, “Computing Machinery and Intelligence.”,Turing had pondered how intelligence could arise in a machine, from operations which were themselves routine and, in a way, mindless. Perhaps it was possible to construct an artificial consciousness from blocks of cold mathematical logic.,He had a practical suggestion: if a computer could fool people into thinking that they were interacting with another person, rather than a machine, then it could be classified as possessing artificial intelligence. This simple idea has proved hugely influential. Since 1991, an annual competition based on the ‘Turing test’ has been held by the American inventor
Hugh Loebner
.,Turing was still haunted by the loss of Morcom. In his 1950 paper, he referred to research, perhaps by
Samuel Soal
in the UK, that there was ‘overwhelming’ statistical evidence of telepathy and remarked: “Once one has accepted them it does not seem a very big step to believe in ghosts.”,The next year Turing became interested in breaking the codes of life, furnishing a chemical basis for the means by which shape, structure and function arise in living things. It is known in biology as morphogenesis and had seemed so mysterious to some that it had fostered belief in vitalism, the idea that there was an élan vital that was distinct from physical or chemical forces.,Turing posed a basic question. How does an organism marshal a chemical soup into a biological structure or turn a spherical (symmetrical) bundle of identical cells into an (asymmetrical) organism? And why are there Fibonacci numbers (where each number is the sum of the previous two) in the leaf patterns of plants such as the close-packed spirals of sunflower heads? (our sister museum, the
Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester
, has carried out a
mass experiment
to investigate). Turing’s ideas have since led to some impressive descriptions of pattern formation in Nature, from snail shells to snake skins.,With the help of Age UK, the Science Museum has consulted lesbian and gay people who were alive in the 1950s to understand the moral climate. What became clear was that Turing was remarkably open about his homosexuality, despite the repressive attitudes of the day. Perhaps his logic and his honesty made him feel that his orientation could never be seen as a crime. After the sheltered, liberal environments of Cambridge and Bletchley, he was in for a shock.,Homosexuality was a criminal offence at the time and in February 1952 Turing was arrested for having a sexual relationship with a man, then tried and convicted of “gross indecency”. To avoid prison, he accepted treatment with the female sex hormone oestrogen: ‘chemical castration’ intended to neutralise his libido. In 2009 Gordon Brown, the then Prime Minister,
issued a public apology
for his treatment.,In that era, homosexual people were considered a security risk, being open to blackmail. Turing’s security clearance was withdrawn, so that he could no longer work for GCHQ, the post-war successor to Bletchley Park. He died soon after.,The precise circumstances leading to his demise on 7 June 1954, at home in Wilmslow, Cheshire, can never be known. But Turing had himself spoken of suicide and this was the conclusion of the coroner, following an inquest.,Next to Turing’s body was an apple, partly eaten. Years before, as some biographers have pointed out, Turing had gone to see Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the pioneering Disney film, in Cambridge, and was particularly taken with the scene where the Wicked Witch dangled an apple into a boiling cauldron: “Dip the apple in the brew. Let the Sleeping Death seep through”. One said that Turing had decided “to invest his departure from a world that had treated him shabbily with some of the gothic, eerie, colourful brilliance of a Disney film.”,The pathologist’s post-mortem report, reproduced in our new exhibition, suggests that the reality was more prosaic. The autopsy revealed that Turing’s stomach contained four ounces of fluid that smelt of bitter almonds: a solution of a cyanide salt. His death was not accidental: there was enough poison to fill a wine glass. Turing, thought the pathologist, had taken bites from the apple to make his last drink more palatable.,More than two decades earlier, when Turing was 17, he had had a vivid premonition of Morcom’s death, at the very instant that his first love was taken ill. Turing felt that this was an omen, one that lay beyond what science was able to explain.,Throughout his life he pursued the question of mind and body, believing that Morcom’s spirit lived on. Perhaps his suicide was one last experiment. On that cold, wet Whit Monday, did Turing take his own life in the hope that they would be together once more?,David Rooney is a Curator and Roger Highfield a Director at the Science Museum Group.,Codebreaker: Alan Turing’s Life and Legacy

But the ‘Jaipur Foot’, as it became known, made prosthetics affordable for the first time, which was a blessing for some of society’s most disadvantaged people, amputees.,Today would have been PK Sethi’s 90th birthday, to mark the occasion we look at how the ‘Jaipur Foot’, an example of which is on display in our exhibition
Illuminating India: 5000 Years of Science and Innovation
, came to be.,Sethi started his career as a general surgeon, transferring to Orthopaedics in 1958, while working at the Sawai Mansingh Medical College in Jaipur. This career change wasn’t so much the result of personal interest, but simply because the Medical Council of India had declared the hospital required an Orthopaedics department. Despite this, he took a keen interest his new specialism and dedicated much of his time to treating and rehabilitating amputees.,It was while working in Jaipur that Sethi met Ram Chandra Sharma, a craftsman at the hospital. In 1968 Sharma approached Sethi to assist him with an idea he’d had for a new type of prosthetic, which he claimed had come to him after suffering a flat tire while cycling.,Unlike most prosthetics at the time, which were made of carbon fibre, the ‘Jaipur Foot’ was created using rubber, plastic and wood. This meant that the manufacturing costs were significantly lower, costing only $45 to produce, making prosthetics affordable to working people for the first time.,Not only did they cost less than their western equivalent, they were significantly more flexible as well, and didn’t require the wearer to use shoes. This made them more comfortable to wear, and more practical for everyday life in India where many people go barefoot.,This democratisation of artificial limbs has also allowed charities, such as
Bhagwan Mahaveer Vikliang Sahayata Samiti
(BMVSS), to produce the Jaipur Foot themselves, and distribute them for free to some of society’s most disadvantaged people. Since they were established in 1975 BMVSS have improved the lives of over 1.5million people in 27 countries worldwide.,Other charities, especially those working in warzones such as the International Red Cross, have also made use of the Jaipur Foot to treat casualties of war, particularly during the conflicts in Afghanistan and Kargil (Kashmir).,Sadly, Ram Chandra Sharma received little credit for his creation, largely due to his low social status. However, in 1981, in recognition of his work, and the role that the Jaipur Foot has played in increasing the quality of life for millions of people, Sethi was awarded both the Magsaysay Award for Community Leadership and the Padma Shri, the fourth highest civilian award in India. He was also later made a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons.,Upon his death on 6 January 2008 India’s President Pratibha Patil honoured him, declaring that he “helped amputees to continue their lives without the feeling of inadequacy, for which he shall always be remembered”.,You can see an example of a Jaipur Foot prosthetic on display in our exhibition

They keep things interesting and provide endless material for new exhibitions. However, often it’s this mass of amazing stories that makes the exhibition process so difficult. When you have just a few square metres to discuss a topic as vast as antibiotic resistance or to cover 40 years of IVF technology, decisions on what to include can feel like having just 50p to spend in a vast sweetshop.,Despite this, as soon as we started researching the topic of IVF we knew there was one story that would definitely make the final cut. Jean Purdy was a central figure in the development of IVF and yet she is rarely remembered. That’s why, throughout the exhibition process, we’ve been clear that we will remember Jean Purdy.,In 1968 the embryologist Robert Edwards was just starting out on a new venture with the surgeon and gynaecologist Patrick Steptoe. The pair were planning to use Steptoe’s expertise with early keyhole surgery to explore Edwards’ hope that human eggs could be removed from the body, fertilised and the resulting embryo placed back into the womb to bypass blocked reproductive tracts. It was an ambitious plan, especially as Edwards was yet to fertilise a human egg.,This was the team that Jean Purdy joined. Hired as a lab technician by Edwards, she was tasked with managing the laboratory. But in reality she did much more. Like Edwards she was based in Cambridge, and she regularly drove the hundreds of miles to their clinic in Oldham, Greater Manchester, taking her away from home for days at a time. Purdy was so indispensable that when she was unable to travel while caring for her ailing mother, all work
stopped for several months
. Of that time Edwards recalled, ‘Jean’s cooperation had become crucial. It was no longer just Patrick and me. We had become a threesome.’,Purdy was not just central to the running of the lab but also to the scientific work. She was a co-author with Robert Edwards on 26 academic publications between 1970 and 1985 and has been credited with being the
first person
ever to recognise and describe the formation of the early human blastocyst. Her role as an embryologist also led her to be the first person to witness the successful cell division of the embryo that would become Louise Brown, the first IVF baby.,When the team finally found IVF success with the births of Louise Brown and Alastair MacDonald, it was time for them to find a new clinic. It was Purdy that hunted through the old manor houses of Cambridge and finally found Bourn Hall, the first IVF clinic and one that is still running today.,Clearly Purdy was integral to IVF, but even today her name is rarely mentioned. When asking why this might be, we could point to her tragic and early death in 1985, cutting her off in her prime and preventing her from contributing to the many books and documentaries that came later. But this is probably only part of the reason. Patrick Steptoe died in 1988, soon after Purdy but also long before the Nobel Prize that was awarded to Robert Edwards for the work in 2010. Steptoe’s name does not seem to have been lost to the passage of time.,We could also ask if Purdy’s gender meant she was taken less seriously by reporters. Or was her role as a lab technician seen as unimportant next to that of the surgeon and the scientist? Whatever the reason, it was not for lack of trying from Edwards. He repeatedly emphasised Purdy’s importance and unsuccessfully lobbied her name to be added to the commemorative plaque placed at the site of their original clinic.,Forty years since the development of IVF there is renewed interest in Jean Purdy, and her name can finally be seen alongside those of Robert Edwards and Patrick Steptoe on a Royal Society of Biology blue plaque, unveiled in 2015. For us at the Science Museum it has been a pleasure to learn about her work as an IVF pioneer and right this historical wrong within our exhibition. You can’t put everything in an exhibition, but there are some things you absolutely cannot leave out.,See

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/complacency-convenience-confidence-the-history-of-vaccine-hesitancy/,Imogen Clarke,"Complacency, Convenience, Confidence: The History of Vaccine Hesitancy",Curator Imogen Clarke looks back at the history of vaccine hesitancy through items in the Science Museum Group Collection. ,"Science in the news,Collections and Objects,Exhibitions and Galleries","medicine,public history,Science Museum","Just over forty years ago, following an extensive global vaccination campaign, the world was declared free of smallpox. It remains the one infectious disease in humans that has been eradicated by such direct intervention.,But for as long as vaccines have existed, so too have expressions of doubt, concern, and suspicion about their use.,Vaccine hesitancy
refers to ‘delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccination despite availability of vaccination.’,Such vaccine hesitancy has arisen for varied and complex social, political, and cultural reasons, ranging from misinformation or lack of credible information, to religious beliefs or simply wanting reassurance that a vaccine is safe.,The
first vaccination against smallpox
was carried out by the English country doctor
Edward Jenner
in 1796.,Smallpox was a highly infectious disease which caused rashes, pustules and often left people with deeply pock-marked skin. The disease also killed in large numbers and had an especially high fatality rate amongst young children.,Jenner had previously been variolating people, a method first recorded in China approximately a thousand years ago, which involved the deliberate infection of a person with a disease in the hope that a mild, but protective, infection would result.,In the local Gloucestershire countryside, Jenner became aware of a similar practice amongst local farming communities.,Milkmaids, who were renowned for their clear complexions, were often immune to smallpox and its scarring pock marks because they were exposed to a milder disease of cattle disease known as cowpox.,Jenner decided to test the effectiveness of this technique and in 1796 carried out his
first successful vaccination
.,He took pus from a cowpox pustule on the hand of milkmaid Sarah Nelmes and inserted it into a cut made in the arm of a young boy named
James Phipps
. This became known as the ‘arm-to-arm’ method as it involved the direct transferral of infected matter straight from one person’s arm to another.,Six weeks later, Jenner inoculated young James with smallpox matter and the boy showed no signs of the disease.,Jenner called the procedure ‘vaccination’ after the Latin word for cow (vacca) and published his findings to the scientific community.,Though his apparent discovery gained some interest, it was also met with criticism and even ridicule.,As with variolation, many early critics thought vaccination was unclean or immoral, especially because it involved transferring ‘foreign’ fluids into their bodies.,Whilst there was some support from members of the church, there was much religious opposition. Some Christian groups viewed scarring the skin and the introduction of foreign particles as a violation of the sacred body made in God’s image.,Satirical printmaker and caricaturist
James Gillray
created this cartoon in 1802, drawing on public concerns around vaccination. The scene depicts a crowd of vaccinated people thrown into disarray as they seemingly morph into cows with cattle leaping from their skin.,Resistance also came from some variolators who saw the loss of their lucrative business. Dr William Rowley, a prolific variolator, published a pamphlet in the hopes of damaging the vaccination cause.,His pamphlet entitled
Cow-Pox Inoculation No Security Against Small-Pox Infection
drew on the fears Gilray had mockingly portrayed in his cartoon, showing illustrations of an ‘Ox-Faced Boy’ and ‘Mange Girl’.,Pamphlets such as this depicting ‘vaccine disaster’ are an early example of the spreading of misinformation.,Historically, vaccination was much more painful than it is today, with at least four cuts made in the flesh of a person’s arm using a sharp blade or lancet. Vaccine matter would then be smeared into the cuts. The associated pain caused hesitation amongst some, though the promise of protection from deadly disease outweighed these fears for others.,Vaccination methods were also much less safe without today’s strict laboratory testing, trialling, and monitoring. Many had legitimate fears that the arm-to-arm method could spread other human illnesses, whilst others even feared it could spread mental illness.,In 1853, 30 years after Jenner’s death, smallpox vaccination was made compulsory under the
1853 Compulsory Vaccination Act
with heavy penalties for those who didn’t comply.,This act, which was seen by many to take away personal choice and bodily autonomy, spurred a rise in the Victorian anti-vaccination movement. As a result, tens of thousands of people took to the streets to protest.,Anti-vaccinationists of the time were not only middle-class reformers but were also from the politically active working class.,Whilst the 1853 Act only applied to children, it provoked fears of smallpox outbreaks amongst employers. As a result, some demanded their employees be vaccinated or otherwise risk being fired.,This new law also caused anxieties around social status as well as ‘moral integrity’, with many opposing public vaccinations as it forced those who considered themselves to be of respectable working class into direct physical contact with paupers: ‘
For the blood of those with questionable morals and debatable health, anti-vaccinationists maintained, could pollute that of their own respectable and ‘pure’ infants.
‘,Whilst many took to the streets in protest, others rallied opposition in the form of anti-vaccination groups.,The
leaflet
featured below, published by the National Anti-Vaccination League in the 1880s, informs the reader that pock-marked faces were a “curious illusion” which were disappearing from society before vaccination was introduced – an attempt to debunk the success of vaccination.,Campaigns against smallpox vaccination continued for years.,In 1923, in response to a smallpox epidemic in Gloucester and the surrounding areas, the following poster appeared as an article in The Times newspaper.,The medical correspondent for The Times referred to the anti-vaccination campaigns a month earlier, writing that the outbreak ‘need never have occurred if the population availed itself of vaccination. Few more lamentable demonstrations of the evil effects of a stupid and mischievous propaganda have ever been afforded.’,History tells us that vaccine hesitancy occurs for complex and wide-ranging factors. Though doubt, distrust and scepticism are certainly not resigned to the past.,The World Heath Organisation identified vaccine hesitancy as one of the
ten biggest threats to global health
in 2019.,The introduction and roll out of the COVID-19 vaccine in the UK has focussed attention once again on
vaccine hesitancy
, and how best to build public trust .,On 24 February 2021, the Science Museum hosted a discussion on vaccine hesitancy, with experts including US physician Dr Anthony Fauci, Vaccine Deployment Minister Nadhim Zahawi MP and Director of the Vaccine Confidence Project Professor Heidi Larson.

It was made for the 4th Earl of Orrery,
Charles Boyle
. His County Cork title gave its name to subsequent planetary models.,Another Irish peer with a keen interest in astronomy was
William Parsons

reconstructed telescope at Birr Castle
.,There’s one big snag with building a telescope in Ireland – rain. Lots of it. Many of Lord Rosse’s visitors moaned about ruined observing nights. But during some rare breaks in the clouds, Rosse was able to observe nebulae, hazy patches of sky that had been puzzling astronomers for years. Thanks to the great mirror’s light-gathering power, he could see that some had spiral structures. We now know they are galaxies beyond our own. (Today, ‘nebula’ has a different meaning in astronomy).,Another telescope used to study nebulae was

The unsung heroes of early NASA were often those who not only broke gender, but racial stereotypes too.",At the Museum,"space,untold stories,women in science,women in STEM","Dorothy Vaughan was a mathematician, and NASA’s first black manager.,Rarely seen as the face of a space programme, Vaughan’s contributions were vast. As well as being the first African-American to receive a promotion at NASA, she was an expert in FORTRAN – a frontrunner of electronic computer programming.,Dorothy Vaughan was born on 20 September 1910 in Kansas City, Missouri. Showing keen intellect from an early age, Vaughan was awarded a full-tuition scholarship to attend Wilberforce University in Ohio.,After graduating, Vaughan worked as a maths teacher for 14 years before joining fellow African-American female mathematicians at the West Area Computing Unit in 1943. The unit was situated in NASA’s predecessor NACA (National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics’), in Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory.,As men were drafted into the Second World War, a gap emerged in the workforce. President Roosevelt signed two executive orders to alleviate racial, religious, and ethnic discrimination within the defense sector. As these new opportunities emerged, Vaughan’s expertise was quickly recognised, and she joined a team of black women in NACA’s West Area Computing Unit.,Yet despite this victory, Jim Crow laws meant the West Area Computing Unit was a segregated facility, and the women were required to use separate bathrooms and dining facilities from their white colleagues. Jim Crow was the name of the racial caste system which enforced segregation on a local and state basis, the derogatory term was named after a fictional character of a black slave ‘Jim Crow’, performed by a white actor Thomas Dartmouth Rice in 1828.,These women, known as ‘human computers’, produced complex mathematical calculations by hand, using simple

The ‘computers’ contributed to almost every aspect of research at Langley, and in 1949, Vaughan was appointed acting supervisor of the program, becoming the first African-American woman to receive a promotion in the agency. She also acted as an advocate for the women of West Computing, and often intervened on issues around pay and promotions on their behalf.,Despite it taking two years for Dorothy Vaughan’s position to be made permanent, she remained at what is now known as
NASA
for 28 years, contributing to the major space feats which helped the US to keep pace with the Soviet Union, and ultimately win the
space race
to the Moon.,Progressing from pen and paper, and in anticipation of a digital transformation, in 1958 Vaughan joined the new Analysis and Computation Division, a gender and racially diverse group on the frontier of
electronic computing
.,Teaching herself FORTRAN, an early computer programming language, Vaughan was so quick to master the software that she progressed to teach it to many of her colleagues on the unit. Through this teaching, Vaughan created a valuable workforce of African-American women who could continue to contribute to the space programme making milestones, such as the
Scout Launch Vehicle
that sent some of America’s first satellites into space, possible.,Despite being unheralded at the time, Vaughan’s trailblazing career has only recently been widely acknowledged. Hollywood’s 2016 film
‘Hidden Figures’
based on Margot Lee Shetterly’s non-fiction book, showcases the careers and contributions of NASA employees Katherine Johnson, Mary Winston Jackson, and Dorothy Vaughan.,In a 1994 interview, when asked about her time at Langley, Vaughan said, “I changed what I could, and what I couldn’t, I endured.” A career tainted by discrimination, her story showcases strength and perseverance at its best."

Hidden Figures
, you may be familiar with the story of Mary W. Jackson: a talented mathematician and scientist who worked at NASA as a human computer – someone who performed incredibly complex calculations required for NASA’s research by hand.,Jackson grew up in the
era of segregation
in the USA, where what was available to you, such as education, housing, and facilities, was determined by the colour of your skin. Not only did she overcome these barriers to make history as NASA’s first black female engineer, but she also dedicated much of her life to empowering those around her.,She tutored high school and college students, served as a Girl Scout leader for 30 years, and used her engineering expertise to help a local African American science club construct their own wind tunnel and perform experiments to investigate airflow around model aircraft, all alongside her remarkable career. On her 100th birthday, we take a look back at her life and just some of her achievements.,Mary Jackson was born Mary Winston on 9 April 1921, in Hampton, Virginia, USA. She graduated from the all-black George P. Phoenix Training School with highest honours, and went on to attain a dual bachelor’s degree in mathematics and physical science from Hampton University in 1942. She then spent a year teaching mathematics at an African-American school in Maryland, before returning to her hometown. It was around this time that she began tutoring, something that she continued to do throughout her life.,In 1951, Jackson was recruited by NASA (which was known as the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, or NACA, until 1958) to work as a ‘computer’ at the
Langley Research Center
in Hampton.,Computers, or human computers, were the people who performed all the mathematical calculations that underpinned so much of NASA’s research. Teams of these mathematicians, predominantly women and African-American women in particular, worked in computing pools supporting engineers by calculating anything they needed, from charting rocket trajectories to analysing air-flow around aircraft, all by hand.,Jackson worked in the segregated West Area Computing section for two years, until she received an offer to work for engineer Kazimierz Czarnecki in the Supersonic Pressure Tunnel, a 60,000-horsepower wind tunnel capable of producing winds at speeds almost double the speed of sound. The 4ft by 4ft (1.2m by 1.2m) tunnel was used to test the aerodynamics of model aircraft.,Under Czarnecki, Jackson had the chance to gain first-hand experience of conducting research experiments. It was Czarnecki’s suggestion that she should go for an engineering position, a role that would require her to take graduate-level classes in maths and physics.,The classes were part of a night programme offered by the University of Virginia, but were held at an all-white high school, and Jackson had to petition the City of Hampton to be allowed to attend. She was successful, and in 1958 was promoted to aerospace engineer, becoming NASA’s first black female engineer.,As an aerospace engineer, Jackson’s role was to analyse data from wind tunnel experiments as well as real test flights to understand how airflow interacted with the aircraft, so as to improve the design of US aeroplanes.,During her engineering career, she worked in several NASA divisions, eventually attaining the most senior title in the engineering department, and authored or co-authored 12 technical papers.,In 1979, after just over 20 years as an engineer, Jackson decided to turn her career towards championing equal opportunities. She retrained as an Equal Opportunities Specialist, going on to work as both the Federal Women’s Program Manager and the Affirmative Action Program Manager for NASA.,Mary Jackson remained at NASA until her retirement in 1985, and she passed away in 2005 at the age of 83. She is remembered not only for her ground-breaking professional achievements, but for her life-long advocacy for access and equality in science.,In her latter career, she used her position and experience to improve the career prospects of women in science, engineering and mathematics roles at NASA, but she also devoted her personal time throughout her life to humanitarian and community causes.,She received a number of awards in recognition of her dedication to this work both professionally and personally, including posthumously receiving the Congressional Gold Medal in 2019. In February 2021, NASA headquarters in Washington, DC, was named the Mary W. Jackson NASA Headquarters in her honour."

Soon after touch down the acclamations began.,Over the next few weeks and months it spread, accompanying Gagarin as he visited country after country receiving rapturous reception wherever he went.,In July 1961 he came to the United Kingdom, his first trip outside the Soviet bloc. His invitation came from the Amalgamated Union of Foundry Workers. Before joining the Soviet Air Force Gagarin had been a fellow steel worker. Over four days Gagarin toured London and Manchester where he was introduced to dignitaries, civic leaders, politicians and royalty.,On 14 July he took lunch with Her Majesty the Queen. Everywhere he went he was greeted by huge crowds who wanted to see this charismatic young man – he was just 27 years old – who had taken humanity into the new realm of space. He didn’t have time to visit the Science Museum but not long after the museum put on display a model of his Vostok spacecraft.,At the time the Soviet authorities released very little details of space missions and vehicles and so the model, following the available specifications, looked quite unlike the real thing! Curators and museum workshop technicians remedied this with an accurate scale model a few years later.,Although Gagarin never visited the Science Museum during his short life – he died in an aircraft crash in 1968 – his pioneering mission was well represented in the
2015 Cosmonauts exhibition
and two years later a special bust was unveiled celebrating the man, his life and his breaching of the final frontier for humanity.,You can learn more about Yuri Gagarin’s historic mission in our

Space curator Doug Millard explores this historical moment.",Science in the news,"exploration,space","The little Ingenuity helicopter that has flown on Mars is not the first aerial vehicle sent to another planet.,In 1986 the Soviet Vega mission released a balloon at Venus. It was blown through the dense and very nasty Venusian air (full of sulphuric acid!) for hours, gathering information, data readings and measurements on its way. But Ingenuity is the first powered flight on an alien word.,Ingenuity – named by school student Vaneeza Rupani – is a drone but, despite its simple appearance, is remarkably sophisticated. Because the Martian air is so thin (the atmospheric pressure at the surface of the planet is less than 1% of Earth’s) the helicopter’s blades are large for its size and have to spin astonishingly quickly – 2,400 revolutions per minute.,These design features are necessary to provide the necessary lift in the rarefied atmosphere. The planet does help in another way, however. With Mars gravity being one third of Earth’s – Ingenuity weighs just 1.8 kg there – about the same as a bag of sugar – even though it weighs three times more on Earth.,,Of particular interest will be those surfaces and rocks that appear to have been exposed to water in the past. We know that Mars was once as wet as Earth meaning life might have evolved there too and could have left evidence for the Perseverance rover’s instruments to unlock.,Ingenuity will fly autonomously using sets of information sent previously from Earth and gathered itself from the air with its instruments and cameras. Remote control from Earth is impossible because of the time it takes for radio signals to reach Mars. The delay can be as much as twenty minutes, depending on the distance between the two planets’ at the time.,The information Ingenuity gathers will be sent down to the Perseverance rover and thence via spacecraft orbiting Mars back to Earth. The helicopter may be small and its flights relatively short, but their success may transform the way we go about exploring Mars – by Robot or by astronaut – in the future.,As MiMi Aung, Ingenuity project manager said, and thinking about the first powered flight here on Earth in 1903, ‘We’ve been talking for so long about our Wright Brothers’ moment on Mars, and here it is.’"

exhibition
Our Future Planet
offers visitors the
chance to encounter technologies that hope to help lessen the impact of our increasingly warming atmosphere on our planet
,
including prototypes never displayed in the UK before.,Alongside emission reductions, the utilisation and storage of carbon dioxide captured from our atmosphere has a small but significant part to play. Visitors
will get to see prototype technologies that have not yet been tested at scale but offer
a glimpse of the possibilities of carbon capture, like Klaus Lackner’s Mechanical Tree.,Carbon
c
apture
technologies are being developed to remove carbon dioxide from
the Earth’s
atmosphere and then utilise or store the captured carbon dioxide.,The most significant step we need to make is ending our reliance on fossil fuels. As society works towards that transition carbon capture is potentially a key innovation in mitigating the impacts of climate change.,Our Future Planet
opens with a reminder of the urgency of
the threat to
our
planet.,On display are fossils made from plants that grew and absorbed carbon dioxide 300 million years ago. When fossil fuels, such as coal, oil or natural gas, are burnt it releases energy from the Sun that has been trapped for millions of years. It also releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, making our planet warmer.,The first section of the
exhibition
is
dedicated to nature-based solutions,
giving visitors
the chance to encounter the work of scientists looking at how
the
natural world is responding to increasing levels of carbon dioxide
,
as well as how forests can help to mitigate
the effects of climate change.,Alongside reducing emissions, protecting natural carbon sinks
–
from forests, peatbogs and
mangroves
to oceans
and permafrost
– is
essential to slowing down
rising carbon dioxide levels.,In the next section
visitors will
encounter direct air capture technologies that
are
inspired by nature
,
which
draw
carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere just like trees and plant life
.,T
hese technologies come in different forms
:
from mechanical trees, with branches made of special material that sieve the carbon dioxide out of the air
;
to enhanced rock weathering, where basalt rock dust can be spread over crops in fields and absorb carbon dioxide from the air when it rains.,As visitors move through the exhibition they will
see how carbon capture technologies can be used in industrial settings.
C-Capture is a solvent that
can
filter
the carbon dioxide out of
factory emissions
before they
are released.,But what should we do with all this carbon dioxide once we have captured it? Scientists are
develop
ing
uses for it or
find
ing
places to store
i
t
safely
.,In the final section of the
exhibition,
visitors will
get to see
building materials like concrete and aggregates
and
consumer products including
sunglasses, toothpaste and yoga mats
, all made with captured carbon.,But for carbon capture technology to be impactful on a mass scale, to really contribute to efforts to mitigate the effects of climate change, scientists, industrialists and engineers are developing ways we can lock captured carbon dioxide back underground. Deep in the rock layers of the earth, from where fossil fuels, like coal, oil and natural gas were originally mined.,Our Future Planet
will give visitors a special insight into the technologies that could
help in the fight against climate change and leave them feeling inspired by the
work being done by scientists, engineers and ecologists across the globe to
safeguard natural carbon capture and design
solutions
to help
reduce
carbon dioxide levels
in the future.,Our Future Planet

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/flying-on-a-cushion-of-air/,David Rooney,Flying on a cushion of air,Transport Curator David Rooney celebrates the anniversary of the first-ever hovercraft. ,Collections and Objects,"flight,transport","It’s a busy time for transport anniversaries. I’ve already mentioned the
centenary of Bleriot’s flight across the Channel
and the ninetieth anniversary of Alcock & Brown’s crossing of the Atlantic.,Today, I’ll talk about one more pioneering flight across the water. The craft was called ‘SR-N1’ (Saunders Roe Number 1), and it too flew across the Channel, fifty years to the day since Bleriot first flew over. But this flight, in 1959, was
very
close to the water.,You guessed it: it was the first
hovercraft
crossing.
Christopher Cockerell
, the hovercraft’s inventor, accompanied by a pilot and navigator, made the crossing on 25 July 1959; the craft had previously been demonstrated in the Solent on 11 July. SR-N1 is in the Science Museum’s collection and is stored at our
Wroughton
site. Here it is at Calais, before the maiden crossing.,But Cockerell’s own hovercraft had flown some four years previously. Having acquired a small shipyard on the Norfolk Broads, Cockerell experimented with the improvised kit before completing an experimental prototype model (using model aircraft-type construction of nylon or silk over balsa wood with a glow-plug model aero engine) which he tested by tethering it to a rowing boat at his yard and flying it around. This prototype is also in the museum’s collection and is on show in the
Flight gallery
.,Hovercrafts have never really fulfilled the promise held out for them in the ’50s, apart from some ferry routes and niche uses such as military assault vehicles. Owing largely to their aircraft ancestry they have high manufacture, maintenance and fuel costs, the latter of particular concern now as we look to cut down on fuel use in transportation.,Still, it did lead to the hover mower. It’s said that lawnmower technician
Karl Dahlman
saw a picture of SR-N1 in flight and had the idea of applying its principles to lawncare. You can see a 1970s hover mower in the museum’s ‘
Making the Modern World
‘ gallery."

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/changing-the-game/,Lorna Hutchman,Changing the game,"As part of our Open for All series, Marketing Officer Lorna Hutchman explores the advances in accessibility that are creating a more inclusive gaming industry. ","At the Museum,Research,Science in the news","accessibility,computing,gaming,open for all","With the global pandemic keeping many in isolation, gaming offers a unique space to build online communities, forge genuine, enduring friendships, and provide much-needed entertainment and escapism.,Video game giants such as
Microsoft
have thrived, reporting a 130 percent increase in multiplayer engagement in March and April 2020. It seems there’s never been a better time to play.,Globally, one in five gamers identify as having a disability. According to
Game Accessibility
, 92% of these gamers continue to play despite difficulties. Although efforts have been made by developers and manufacturers to accommodate this lucrative group of passionate gamers, there is still more work to be done.,Deliberate measures to make video gaming more accessible began in the 1970s when small milestones were made to include accessibility in design, establishing the roadwork for later developments.,The world’s first commercially successful video game established a foothold in closing the inclusivity gap at video gaming’s genesis.,Versions of Atari’s ‘Pong’ type games (1972)
were hacked by video game modifiers who slowed down the speed of play. Other Atari 2600 games introduced ‘kids mode’ a feature that reduced the number of enemies and in-game challenges.,Players with disabilities may not have been the impetus of these efforts, but offering a slower rate of play helped gamers with cognitive or learning impairments to engage with strategy in real-time, at a self-determined pace.,As games progressively became more complicated, game controller complexity increased proportionally. Although controller design has largely followed a linear development,
Nintendo
broke the status quo in 1988 with their
NES Hands Free Controller
. The modified piece of hardware was the world’s first custom made video game controller designed exclusively for players with limited mobility by a mainstream gaming company.,The device which strapped on to the chest and allowed users to blow or sip air through a straw, replaced pushing the A and B buttons on a traditional controller. This revolutionised how people with with motor impairments could play.,What seemed like a huge leap forward for
Nintendo
still presented additional barriers to access. The device was only available to purchase through Nintendo’s customer service line and was sold in very limited quantities, at a high cost.,With the advent of digital memory cards and internal gaming storage, the ability to save progress on-the-go provided a welcomed respite for gamers. This advancement also afforded users with both cognitive and mobility requirements to play without added time pressure.,Individual platforms were also undergoing innovations during this time, including the
SEGA Saturn
, which required all their titles to include full button remapping. This empowered gamers who found certain areas of a controller difficult or painful to use to create their own bespoke layout.,In the dawn of the new millennium, accessibility efforts were re-directed to adapting software as opposed to hardware.,Ubisoft
, whose titles include Far Cry and Rayman, made it mandatory for all their games to include subtitles. Game subtitles are imperative for people who are D/deaf or hard of hearing to understand the progressively important and complex narratives and objectives within games. The decision came into play after gaming whistle-blowers highlighted that Assassin’s Creed (2008) failed to offer this option.,Fast forward to 2016, indie developers
Naughty Dog
made huge leaps in creating an equal playing field, surpassing the efforts of most AAA developers.,After a player highlighted that he was unable to finish Uncharted 2 (2009) due to difficulties with button-mashing sequences (repeated pressing of buttons),
Naughty Dog
created a more accessible title.,By creating an option to remove button-mashing and use single stick aiming, Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End (2016) enabled users with limited dexterity and coordination to progress through the game.,Other successes followed with the release of
Shadow of the Tomb Raider
, which
innovated the way
gamers with cognitive issues could play in-game challenges without altering the complexity of the puzzles.,Gaming titan
Microsoft
also levelled up to meet this standard with the release of the
Xbox Adaptive Controller
in 2018.,Designed exclusively for gamers with reduced mobility, the controller can connect to external switches, buttons, mounts, and joysticks for custom set-ups. Allowing players to own their gaming experience.,The controller is so accessible, in fact, that it has the ability to be used cross-platform with any gaming system, not just Xbox.,In 2020,
Naughty Dog
once again broke new ground in meeting accessibility demands with the development of the award-winning The Last Of Us 2, widely celebrated as the most accessible game of this generation.,With a total of 60 accessibility settings to cater to vision, motor, and hearing-impaired players, The Last Of Us 2 has set the blueprints for positioning accessibility at the forefront of development.,A clear pattern that has emerged through these advances is that change has been implemented in response to players who have been brave enough to share their experiences. These gamers are the true champions of the sector.,Whilst there may not a blanket approach to meeting the needs of all disabilities, charities such as
AbleGamers
and
Special Effect
help to enhance play on an individual level. Both charities provide custom gaming set-ups from controller mods to voice and switch controls, tailored to the specific requirements of each gamer.,While a truly level playing field is still a long way off, inclusive gaming experiences are created by listening to the community.,It’s the responsibility of developers and manufacturers to collaborate and ensure accessibility is considered at every stage of the game, from planning to play."

.,Glyn’s first entry is Real Life by Brandon Taylor.,The Booker Prize-nominated
Real Life
is a campus novel set over a long weekend in the American mid-west. It follows Wallace, a biochemistry PhD student, and his interactions with his fellow doctoral students and supervisors.,Although this is a debut novel, Taylor (who is a former biochemist himself – drawing on his own experience at University) imbues the book with turns of phrase which are beautiful in their precision and imagery, whether it’s describing the vast lake which dominates the campus, the life cycle of the nematode worms on Wallace’s petri dishes, or some other element of lab work.,‘…she plates thousands of tiny cultures, clumps of greyish cells that grow and divide, or else die, in pools of brilliant red media. Wallace once found her there, like stumbling upon a spirit in a myth. She had been dabbing tears from her eyes with her bare forearm, dabbing and pipetting simultaneously in one unbroken motion. She had a heavy scent to her, like salt water.’ (p. 63),Researching and writing a PhD thesis is a stressful and isolating experience in any circumstances: imposter syndrome is rife (the often unspoken and erroneous feeling that you aren’t good enough to complete your studies and sooner or later someone is going to find that out), and I don’t know of any recent students that have not experienced some level of mental
health crisis
.,For Wallace, those feelings are compounded by the additional isolation which he feels as a result of who he is. Wallace is a queer black man in a particularly white part of the United States. This means that the already difficult pressures of social situations, work-place politics, and negotiating with your peers and seniors carry with them the added barbs of casual (or in some cases, overt) racism and homophobia.,Normal postgraduate anxieties and the recent death of his father dredging up memories and feelings of his home in Alabama, a lifestyle and circumstances he is not eager to have to return to, Wallace is already conflicted about whether a PhD in biochemistry is really for him.,Taylor’s narrative clings tightly to Wallace’s train of thought as he grapples with these feelings, difficult enough for anyone, whilst simultaneously being made to feel that he doesn’t fit into his lab because of his skin colour. When his supervisor or fellow students question whether he belongs there, and after one of his experiments fails under potentially suspicious circumstances, he cannot know if they are articulating his genuine self-doubt or their own racist presumptions.,For example, early on Wallace describes the makeup of his academic cohort:,‘Their class had been the first small one in quite some time, and the first in more than three decades to include a black person. In his less generous moments, Wallace thought these two things related, that a narrowing, a reduction in the number of applicants, had made his admission possible.’ (p. 8),Reading this book in the context of this blogpost raises a lot of questions about who we encourage to pursue scientific fields. 7.6% of UK domiciled students enrolled at UK universities are black, roughly in line with the population figures for University-age students, and entry levels for STEM subjects are similarly proportional. However black students
are more likely to enroll
at universities with focuses on teaching rather than the more research-led Russell Group institutions which are normally considered more prestigious.,Partly as a result of this, black students are
almost 50% less likely
to advance to studying for a postgraduate research qualification such as a PhD within 5 years of graduation than their white peers.,However,
Real Life
also made me think about the other side of the equation: the white students and professors who are either institutionally or openly racist in their interactions with Wallace, why is the University system accommodating them without hesitation?,Away from the science and studies (although as any PhD student will tell you, it is always lurking in the background of your mind), Wallace’s weekend is spent negotiating social situations which are similarly tinged by the preconceived notions of race, class, and sexuality. The novel’s writing is sensual, provocative and at times troubling as Wallace embarks on a new sexual (and potentially, romantic) relationship with one of his peers and wrestles his loneliness even whilst surrounded by people who consider themselves his friends or in the arms of a lover.,This is a novel which, as the title suggests, is very true to the everyday experience of many people in the scientific community. It is also a novel about how scary academic life can be. Much like the work of a writer like Sally Rooney, it is also about how isolating it can be to be young, and about the challenges of love. It is a book that feels thoroughly American yet also universal. It is a novel about science, but it is also a mirror on society.,For me, it is a book that brought up a lot of emotions and gave me plenty to think about. It has some beautiful moments that charmed me with their prose and others that made me uncomfortable but that I will be thinking about for years to come.

.,Karen Joy Fowler’s We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves, originally published in 2013, is about family, growing-up and developmental psychology. The novel’s narrator is Rosemary, and was raised alongside an adopted sibling, Fern, by her psychologist parents as part of a long-term experiment. The two are constantly compared by ever-changing teams of grad students, their interactions and behavioural quirks published in scientific journals and Ph.D theses.,This is the kind of environment which would have a lasting effect on anyone, but the real damage is done when Fern disappears. Not only does Rosemary lose her sister, but the collapse of the experiment sends her father into a paranoid spiral of drinking and despair, her mother becomes depressed, and her older brother leaves home and cuts all ties.,The novel is narrated by Rosemary at college-age and loops backwards through her life, painting portraits of the colourful characters that make up the immediate family and attempting to understand her unusual childhood, come to terms with what happened to Fern, and attempt to understand what constitutes a “normal” life.,Fowler is a really talented writer who excels at creating intelligent, interesting characters who are interesting to read about whether they’re arguing about meal options or conducting cognitive behavioural tests.,She has a particular skill at blending other cultural influences into her work, her bestseller
The Jane Austen Book Club
(2004) incorporates various literary critiques of Austen’s work, for example, but also contains a love letter to science fiction legend Ursula Le Guin.,In
We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves
the author similarly captures the mundanities of growing up in the 80s in America: the daytime television, the music on the radio, and so on, but also includes a sort of potted history of developmental psychology and a fascinating analysis of experimental ethics and the scientific method.,In particular, the branch of developmental psychology that the novel focuses on is that of animal behaviour. The status of the human characters as animals themselves is a continual theme, for example in comparisons of case studies of animals interacting with an apparatus such as the operant conditioning chamber or “Skinner Box” developed by psychologist B F Skinner and being rewarded with treats and then those same experiments being performed on humans (normally children or babies) to compare the results.,The experiment which has the greatest bearing on the novel however is the one conducted by Winthrop Kellogg and his wife Luella at Indiana University in the 1930s, Fowler’s own father was also a research psychologist in the same department but he didn’t start work there until after the Kelloggs had left.,The Kelloggs raised their son Donald simultaneously with a chimpanzee infant named Gua.
We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves
isn’t a fictionalisation of the Kelloggs’ experiment, it is largely set in the 1980s and the characters are aware of, and building upon, the Kelloggs’ research findings, but it is nonetheless a replay of sorts. Fern, you see, is revealed to be a chimpanzee.,Fern, like Gua before her, is treated as a human and there is no distinction made between her treatment and that of Rosemary. They receive the same treats at the same time, they are held to the same standards, they are raised as twins neither fully human or fully chimp.,It’s a situation which would seem too bizarre to be plausible if it weren’t based on a real case study (indeed more than one, the Kellogg experiment is the most famous but similar experiments have repeated it, some of which are also referenced in the book, not to mention those who have kept chimps as exotic pets and raised them in this manner without any pretence to experimental science).,The morality of all this is a key concern of the novel, although the formal scientific ethics is acknowledged as a moving target.,As anyone who has studied psychology knows, you could get away with a lot in the 1930s and whilst there were more rules by the 80s those relating to primate experiments have only subsequently been tightened.,Nonetheless, the novel is not concerned with whether Rosemary’s parents broke the code of conduct for their discipline it is interested in what happens when work consumes life, when family and home become subjects and lab, and when science supersedes love.,It’s a remarkable and thought-provoking novel and I look forward to hearing your thoughts about it.,Whether you’re an occasional reader or an avid bookworm, we would love to hear your thoughts on the text, you can reach us online by using #SMBookClub."

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/light-based-quantum-computer-takes-minutes-to-do-a-2-5-billion-year-task/,Roger Highfield,Light-based quantum computer takes minutes to do a 2.5-billion-year task,"Roger Highfield, Science Director, discusses the latest milestone in quantum computing with Prof Chao-Yang Lu.","Research,Science in the news","computing,physics,research,science","The most important mathematical work in China’s long history is
Jiuzhang suanshu
(‘Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art’), a second BC text compiled by generations of scholars.,Now a novel kind of computer named in its honour has lived up to the reputation of this grand book of mathematics where Jiu represents ‘9’ and, because it is the largest digit, also means ‘supreme’.,Developed by a team led by Prof
Chao-Yang Lu
and Jian-Wei Pan at the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, the
quantum computer
has cracked a problem that seems to lie beyond the reach of the ‘classical’ digital computers that run so much of modern life.,Japan’s Fugaku supercomputer, the world’s most powerful classical computer, would take 600 million years to accomplish what Jiuzhang can do in just 200 seconds, said Prof Lu.,The feat is the most convincing yet of what some call quantum advantage, or quantum supremacy.,In 2019, Google was
the first to claim quantum supremacy
using a quantum computer called Sycamore, which relies on superconducting circuits, that is, which conduct electricity without resistance at low temperatures.,While conventional computers that inhabit our homes, offices and pockets, encode information in the form of bits, which can take the value of 1 or 0, quantum computers such as Sycamore use ‘qubits’, which can represent both a 1 and a 0 at the same time. They are said to be entangled – think of it like interference – so that they can perform parallel computing.,Even though Sycamore had a relatively modest number of quantum bits (qubits) – just 53 – it could sample the solutions of the ‘random circuit sampling problem’ in a mere 200 seconds, whereas the Google team estimated that Summit supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, would take 10,000 years to do the same thing, while full verification would take millions of years.,Prof Lu commented: ‘While Google used superconducting circuits inside an ultracold fridge, we used photons – particles of light – at room temperature. It is nice to demonstrate the quantum advantage using different platforms.’,Quantum advantage, or supremacy, does not necessarily indicate that the quantum computers are yet useful. This is because the problems that they are set are selected to be difficult for classical computers and tend to be more esoteric.,Moreover, it remains possible that classical computers can catch up. After Google’s quantum supremacy claim, for example, IBM proposed a type of calculation that might allow a supercomputer to perform the task Google’s computer completed,
casting doubt on the claim.,‘All these claims are based on the current optimal classical algorithm/strategy, which may improve as time goes by,’ commented Prof Lu. ‘Quantum computational advantage, rather than being a one-shot experimental proof, will be the result of a long-term competition between a quantum device and classical simulation.’,Jiuzhang is an analogue machine, that is, a computer which exploits the physical properties of a system to tackle a problem. In this case, the problem is called boson sampling, where bosons are one of the basic classes of particles, which includes photons, which are particles of light.,‘We use photons as bosons, not as qubits,’ said Prof Lu,
who reported the feat with colleagues in the journal
Science
. ‘Strictly, the power of Jiuzhang cannot be expressed in terms of qubits.’,Boson sampling entails calculating the probability distribution of many bosons — in this case, photons — after they encounter a device called a beam splitter, which divides a single beam into divergent beams.,The laser light had been manipulated using its quantum properties (in other words, it had been ‘squeezed’) and, because of quantum effects, if two photons of identical properties (position and polarisation) hit the splitter at the same time, they stuck together and both travelled in the same direction.,Only when you send lots of pulses through the device do reliable interference patterns emerge. Jiuzhang sent laser pulses into a maze of 300 beam splitters, 75 mirrors and 100 detectors capable of spotting a single photon. ‘We detected up to 76 photons,’ said Prof Lu.,With enough photons and beam splitters, Jiuzhang could produce a distribution of numbers of photons that – because the problem scales exponentially – lies beyond the reach of a classical computer to calculate: using Jiuzhang the team achieved within minutes what would take half the age of Earth using the best existing supercomputers.,One advantage of digital computers – and Sycamore too – is that they can be programmed to do different things while Jiuzhang is designed only to do boson sampling. ‘Very tricky point,’ said Prof Lu. ‘Most people think that Jiuzhang is not programmable.  But, actually, to some extent it already can be. We will try to make use of some tuning knobs in the incoming light to do something useful in a few months.’,Prof Lu added that boson sampling can also be adapted for machine learning, a popular approach to artificial intelligence. ‘We are performing such an experiment and aiming for applications in machine learning,’ said Prof Lu. Compared with conventional computers, photon-based devices such as Jiuzhang offer advantages because they consume a fraction of the power, have higher throughput and work at the speed of light.,There is a
limit to what digital computers can do
because the binary numbers on which they depend – ones and zeroes – offer a much more limited palette of mathematical possibilities than the continuous, or analogue, quantities of the real world. In contrast, ’Jiuzhang is an analogue device,’ said Prof Lu.,The first computers were also analogue, that is, physical systems configured to be governed by equations identical to the ones you want to solve. The Science Museum Group collection has various analogue machines, such as the
‘differential analyser’
developed by
Douglas Hartree at the University of Manchester
, capable of solving differential equations that are fundamental to modelling the world because they describe how things change.,Traditional analogue machines were cumbersome in every sense. They represented the quantity they were computing as the size of some part of the apparatus. If you wanted a more accurate answer, you needed a bigger device:  because the information is encoded in a physical way (think of the markings on a slide rule, for example)
an extra bit of precision doubles the size of the device.,By contrast, abstracting the input data from an analogue form into a string of ones and zeros allows digital computers to be reprogrammed to perform multiple types of calculations, unlike their purpose-built analogue predecessors. However, analogue devices based on light such as Jiuzhang offer new possibilities for fast, low power parallel computing.,There is a deeper, unresolved, issue with quantum computing. There has been unease about the foundations of quantum theory since Albert Einstein, who helped establish the theory and became one of its most dogged critics. The  2020 physics Nobel prize-winner, Sir Roger Penrose, told me recently that, though successful at some things, ‘current quantum mechanics is wrong.’,Quantum mechanics is wrong because it is incomplete, explained Prof Peter Coveney of UCL, who helped organise a
quantum computer event in 2019 at the Science Museum
. ‘When it comes to quantum computers, for example, it does not explain how you go from the entangled/interference/superposition of zeroes and ones in a qubit to a single output value, a one or a zero.’,Prof Lu commented: ‘quantum mechanics is 120 years old but some of the very fundamental issues still bother us today.’"

Circus250
, a celebration to mark 250 years of the circus.,The host was Jo Quinton-Tulloch, Director of the
National Science and Media Museum
in Bradford, who spoke about the collective ambition across the Science Museum Group ‘to be bold and inspirational’ and harness ‘groupness’, where the group is greater than the sum of its five museums.,Alluding to the ingrained connection between the circus and the Group’s aspirations, Quinton-Tulloch said: ‘We all love to be entertained; we all love to be amazed; we seek inspiration from others who show us what we might achieve.’ And it is the Science Museum Group that ignites ‘the spark that shows what [you] could do in science and technology’.,The keynote speaker at the event was Scottish scientist,
Sir Fraser Stoddart
, Board of Trustees Professor of Chemistry at Northwestern University, whose work on molecular machines led him to share the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2016 with
Ben Feringa
and
Jean-Pierre Sauvage
.,Credited by the Academy with ‘taking chemistry to a new dimension’ in the design and synthesis of
molecular machines
, Sir Fraser took the distinguished audience on a whistle-stop tour of the evolution of machines, from steam, to rocket, to molecular, both natural and made in the laboratory.,And how appropriate, as Sir Fraser rightly pointed out, to be discussing engines through the ages within a gallery that houses Stephenson’s Rocket and the Apollo 10 command module among other marvellous machines.,In 1991 Sir Fraser began his work by threading a molecular ring onto a thin molecular axle and demonstrated that the ring was able to move along the axle. Among his developments based on his ‘rotaxanes’ are a molecular lift, a molecular muscle and a molecule-based computer chip.,Director of the Science Museum Group, Ian Blatchford, led the black-tie audience on a journey through the year’s highlights, including the ‘fantastically popular’
Illuminating India
season which was celebrated with a joint visit from the Prince of Wales and Prime Minister Modi; and
Superbugs: The Fight For Our Lives
. He then looked ahead at some of the exciting exhibitions and galleries that will be opening over the next few years.,Blatchford also celebrated the unpredictability of social media, referring to the ‘delightfully unscripted’
Twitter battle
between the Science Museum and its neighbouring Natural History Museum, all of which was instigated by a member of the public. The twitter thread was viewed by 2.3 million people.,Finally, Dame Mary Archer, Chair of the Board of Trustees, presented a Fellowship to the Museum, its highest accolade offer, to four individuals who have made key contributions.,The first fellowship was awarded to HRH Princess Royal for her tireless efforts in encouraging young people, especially women, to consider careers in science and engineering. No stranger to the museum, the Princess Royal said she was ‘astonished’ and ‘touched’ to receive this honour. She spoke of the importance of innovations in science, technology, engineering and maths in ‘changing the way we live our lives to make them healthier and more worthwhile’.,The second fellowship went to
Dr Kartar Lalvani
, founder and chairman of
Vitabiotics
, the first ever vitamin company to receive the Queen’s Award for Innovation. Dr Lalvani, who fondly recalled the time he spent half a century ago at the Science Museum, said it was an ‘immense honour’ and ‘truly one of my life’s greatest privileges’ to accept the Fellowship. He praised the museum for ‘continually works to engage and inspire new generations of scientists’.,Sir Mark Walport,
Chief Executive of UK Research and Innovation
, UKRI, was the third recipient of the Fellowship and remarked that it was ‘humbling’ to receive it in ‘this extraordinary museum.’,Previously the Government’s Chief Scientific Adviser, Director of the Wellcome Trust and Professor of Medicine at Imperial College, Sir Mark spoke of the extraordinary environmental challenges we collectively face that can only be tackled through science and engineering and highlighted the surprising importance design and art play in facing these challenges in their ‘ability to humanise’ technology.,The final fellowship of the evening was awarded to
Dame Margaret Weston
in absentia
, a former Director of the Science Museum and the first woman ever to direct a national museum, who laid the ‘foundations of the Group we know today’, said Dame Mary, and whose ambitions both in inspiring younger generations and strengthening international relationships still echo.,Among the glittering crowd of VIPs in attendance were British Astronaut, Helen Sharman (Sir Fraser was her chemistry tutor), Lady Helen Hamlyn, Emmy award winner Anthony Geffen, Tej Lalvani of Dragons’ Den and TV presenter and doctor Kevin Fong."
https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/the-multiple-lives-of-alan-turing/,David Rooney,The Multiple Lives Of Alan Turing,"David Rooney, curator of the Science Museum’s award-winning Codebreaker exhibition, discusses mathematician Alan Turing’s contributions to science and society as part of LGBT History Month.",Exhibitions and Galleries,"alan turing,computing,public history,untold stories","February is
Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Trans History Month
, and this year the focus is on mathematics, science and engineering. Here, David Rooney, curator of the Science Museum’s award-winning Codebreaker exhibition, discusses mathematician Alan Turing’s contributions to science and society.,Alan Turing’s life had many facets. He is perhaps most widely known today for his wartime codebreaking exploits at
Bletchley Park
, where he devised processes and technologies to crack German ‘
Enigma
’ messages on an industrial scale. The intelligence uncovered at Bletchley was central to Britain’s war effort and may have shortened the conflict by up to two years. Winston Churchill described the site’s cryptanalysts as his ‘
golden geese that never cackled
’.,Turing’s first major contribution to science had been a paper written in 1936, when he was just 24, on an abstruse theoretical problem in the philosophy of mathematics. ‘On computable numbers, with an application to the Entscheidungsproblem’ attacked German mathematician David Hilbert’s so-called ‘decision problem’, which sought a formal underpinning of mathematics. Turing’s paper was a philosophical bombshell which destroyed the consistency of the subject.,This work brought Turing to the attention of a small group of mathematicians and philosophers, but it was its theoretical description of a ‘universal computing machine’, capable of carrying out any computable task, which was later seen as the conceptual basis of today’s stored-program computers. For Turing, his 1936 universal machines were simply thought experiments, but for others they signalled the future of computing. Turing himself wrote one of the first practical designs for a stored-program computer, later realised as the ‘
Pilot ACE
’, on display in the exhibition.,Alongside his work in cryptanalysis and computing, Turing is also widely remembered for his work on machine intelligence after he left wartime Bletchley Park. The ‘
Turing test
’, sketched out in his seminal 1950 paper ‘Computing machinery and intelligence’, has become a popular trope in artificial intelligence. It was Turing’s response to a philosophical stumbling block. First he asked, ‘Can machines think?’ He then proposed that this, itself, could never be known. Instead, if a machine could appear to be intelligent in a guessing game, then it could be assumed to be intelligent.,The relationship between thought and matter was a common theme throughout Turing’s life. As a teenager at Sherborne School, Dorset, he became closely attracted to a fellow student, Christopher Morcom, who was a year older. Morcom was, if anything, even brighter than Turing, and more devoted to mathematics and science. The pair became close friends, although Turing’s love of Morcom was unrequited.,Meeting Morcom was a watershed in Turing’s life, acting as an emotional catalyst that converted the previously ill-focused, undisciplined but undoubtedly clever boy into a young man constantly attempting to improve himself. Morcom died, aged 18, from tuberculosis, and the rest of Turing’s life seemed to be an attempt to keep Morcom alive and make him proud.,If Morcom’s friendship and death was material in Turing’s intellectual development, it can also be seen as a focus for the complex ideas about intelligence and the mind that Turing developed towards the end of his own life. Writing to Morcom’s mother soon after her bereavement, Turing said, ‘when the body dies the “mechanism” of the body holding the spirit is gone and the spirit finds a new body’. Even in his 1950 paper on machine intelligence Turing showed great interest in paranormal phenomena such as telepathy and psychokinesis that were at the fringes of scientific respectability even then.,Turing’s science remained resolutely off the mainstream. Having broken
codes for the nation
and conceived new paradigms in mathematics, computing and intelligence, he produced final work that was so avant-garde that it was virtually abandoned after his death in 1954, only to be picked up again relatively recently.
Morphogenesis
– the development of pattern and form in living things – occupied his thoughts for the last four years of his life as he ran computer simulations of the mathematics and chemistry of life itself.,At
Cambridge University
, where he studied in the 1930s, and at wartime Bletchley Park, Turing’s homosexuality was relatively tolerated. But in post-war Britain a new morality was rapidly emerging. Britain’s future rested on repopulating the country with young men to replace the millions slaughtered at war. Homosexual people – men and women – were increasingly characterised as deviant and harmful to the fitness of the race, and their presence in society became a matter of national concern.,The Cold War intensified these concerns, as gay people were assumed to be at risk of blackmail, endangering the security of the nation. Turing held some of the nation’s most secret knowledge in his head.,In 1952, following an unlawful sexual relationship, Turing was tried and convicted of ‘gross indecency’ under the anti-homosexuality legislation of the day. He was stripped of his security clearance and his post-war consultancy to Bletchley Park’s successor, the Government Communications Headquarters (
GCHQ
), ended. He was offered a choice of imprisonment or a one-year course of hormone treatment to suppress his libido, and he took the latter. It was chemical castration.,Turing appeared to recover well from the sentence after its effects subsided, but by then he was under police surveillance and it is likely that his actions had become of grave concern to the security services. On 7 June 1954 he ingested a large amount of cyanide solution at his home in Wilmslow, Cheshire and was found dead the next day by his housekeeper. The coroner recorded a verdict of suicide, opining that Turing’s ‘mind had become unbalanced’. Turing did not leave a suicide note, and the full circumstances of his death remain a mystery.,Codebreaker: Alan Turing’s Life and Legacy

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/aiming-for-the-stars/,Doug Millard,Aiming for the stars,"Curator Doug Millard celebrates the life of Mae C. Jemison, engineer and former NASA astronaut who was the first black woman to travel into space.",At the Museum,"exploration,space,untold stories,women in science","In a world facing a multitude of serious environmental challenges, no-one is more aware of the need for urgent action than former astronaut Dr Mae C Jemison.,High on her agenda is a long-held desire to alleviate world hunger, help protect the integrity of biodiversity, and develop sustainable clean energy supplies for those currently without. Though not alone in her ambitions, Jemison believes that part of the solution may be found  through
interstellar travel
– space exploration that takes astronauts
beyond
the solar system to the planets of another star.,Whilst much of the focus within the space community at present is centred on Mars, Mae believes the answers lie far further out in space. She believes it is only when we challenge ourselves to travel outside the Solar system that we will achieve long-lasting results.,Living on an interstellar spaceship for years at a time throws up all manner of technological, logistical and social challenges that allow us to rethink how we live on our own planet.,The extreme nature of interstellar travel, she argues “demands radical leaps in all of our disciplines, our knowledge, our technology, our systems, our capabilities. How we might operate on a starship that contains 5,000 people allows us the opportunity to apply that thinking to our starship [Earth] that we’re on right now”.,Jemison has never shied away from a challenge. Soon after leaving NASA she set up her first company to distribute advanced technologies to areas of the world that need them most.,A second company, which seeks to produce enhanced medical devices to help doctors better understand the human nervous system, builds on her own space mission experience on Shuttle flight STS-47. Whilst on board she was tasked with using special exercise techniques rather than drugs to help alleviate motion sickness – a problem that effects roughly 80% of all astronauts.,Today, her company is investigating whether the exercises can also help alleviate the debilitating symptoms of those suffering from conditions such as migraine or anxiety. She is also the founder of an international science camp that encourages young people between the ages of 12 and 16 to get more involved in science.,Mae herself has always been a devotee of scientific learning. Encouraged by her parents, who regularly took her to museums to help foster an interest in the world around her, she studied chemical engineering at Stanford University alongside a degree in African and African-American studies, later moving on to read medicine at Cornell Medical College.,From an early age she also exhibited a keen interest in astronomy and outer space.,“Growing up on the Southside of Chicago, I was just like every other kid. I loved space, stars and dinosaurs. I always knew I wanted to explore. At the time of the Apollo programme, everybody was thrilled about space, but I remember being irritated that there were no women astronauts.”,Years later in 1983, when Sally Ride rode into space as the first American female astronaut, Mae felt this was something she could now achieve herself.,Her first application to NASA in 1985 was unsuccessful as the
Challenger disaster
occurred soon afterwards and temporarily paused the astronaut recruitment programme.,In 1987 she tried again and this time was successful.,Following an intensive programme of astronaut training and months of ground duties at the Kennedy Space Centre, Mae finally flew into space in September 1992 as a Mission Specialist on the STS-47 Shuttle mission. She was the first female African American to go into space and carried with her a photo of pioneering aviator Bessie Coleman, the first African American to gain an international pilot’s license.,The mission set two other milestones: the first Japanese astronaut to fly aboard an American spacecraft– Mamouru Mohri – and the first married couple to go into orbit together – N. Jay Davis and her, then husband, Mark C. Lee.,The flight lasted eight days – or 190 hours, 30 minutes, 23 seconds – and  carried an onboard laboratory built by the Japanese –
Spacelab J
. Inside the lab Jemison took responsibility for several of the 44 on-board life and materials science experiments. One involved her fertilising eggs from South African clawed frogs and noting how the tadpoles developed during the mission. She was also co-investigator on a bone cell research experiment.,Before each shift she announced her work was about to begin by declaring “Hailing frequencies open”, a quote from the original Star Trek television series she had so enjoyed watching as a child. Her love of Star Trek was cemented the following year when she flew back into space – this time on board the USS Enterprise in an episode of
Star Trek: The Next Generation
, the first astronaut to appear on the programme.,Before her flight Mae was placed into her launch suit by Suit Technician, Sharon McDougle. The two had an excellent relationship and Sharon admired how Jemison could be a normal person one moment and a “super doctor scientist” the next.,As an African American herself, Sharon was especially keen to make sure everything went smoothly recounting in a NASA interview: “I’m sure it was probably a little scary for her being the first African-American woman to go into space. So I wanted to do my part in making it special for her…and for me, because I was excited about being a part of history”.,Mae has never considered herself as a role model – just an ordinary person seeking to do their very best in whatever it is they choose to do. Today she looks back on her youth as a period of change when people started to insist on their right to participate.,She wants us all to do the same for the sake of ourselves and the planet. But to do that, she argues, we will all need to develop confidence and feed our minds:,“Don’t let anyone rob you of your imagination, your creativity, or your curiosity. It’s your place in the world; it’s your life. Go on and do all you can with it, and make it the life you want to live.”,A sentiment which, at the moment, none of us can afford to ignore.,From rockets to satellites, probes to landers, discover objects that are out-of-this-world in our

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/one-world-in-space/,Doug Millard,One World in Space,Curator Doug Millard looks at how our exploration of space is a truly international affair.,Science in the news,"space,technology","In early 2021, three spacecraft speeding towards Mars will reach the red planet. The arrival of the United States’
Mars 2020
, China’s
Tianwen-1
and the U
nited Arab Emirates’ Hope,
will generate national pride and celebration in those three countries.,Just a few days before this year’s national day, the UAE’s mission executed a third and final mid-course correction. All planetary missions need these to make sure they hit their target! That Hope required only three such manoeuvres on the way to Mars – it can be far more – was itself a source of joy for the young space engineers and scientists working on their first ever interplanetary mission.,The United States, on the other hand, has launched many spacecraft to the planet but its Mars 2020 mission with the Perseverance rover on board is the most ambitious and sophisticated of them all. The
‘
seven minutes of terror’ when ground controllers wait in silence for the signal that the lander and its rover have survived their fiery descent through the Martian atmosphere will give way to much cheering, flag waving and jubilation when that signal comes through 18 February, 2021.,China’s ground controllers will have to endure a similar wait while Tianwen-1’s lander and rover descends to the Martian surface two months later. This mission bears witness to China’s careful, long-term planning of its space programme which just this week saw the landing on the Moon of Chang’e-5, a robotic mission to bring lunar samples to Earth – the first time that will have been done since the Soviet Union’s Luna 24 in 1976.,The national objectives of these three missions are clear and yet they all incorporate an international dimension as well. Mars 2020 carries experiments from Spain and Norway as well as those from the US. China’s Tianwen-1 carries instruments on its rover and orbiter that French and Austrian teams helped with. And the UAE’s Hope mission planners teamed with universities in the US during the spacecraft’s development.,Such international collaboration is by no means confined to Mars missions. The Science Museum proudly displays an engineering model of the BepiColombo spacecraft, its flight version now over two years into its 7 year journey to Mercury. ‘Bepi’ is a collaborative venture from the 22 member state European Space Agency (ESA) and JAXA –Japan’s Aerospace Exploration Agency. Some 1200 scientists and engineers from 16 different countries worked on the spacecraft.,And in three years’ time the cheerfully named SMILE mission will investigate the interaction of the Solar Wind with Earth’s magnetosphere, to learn more of how our own star affects planet Earth. SMILE is a joint venture between China’s Academy of Sciences and ESA with the United Kingdom, as with Bepi, contributing significantly to the mission.,These are indeed exciting times for the UK’s space programme. Before long satellites will be launched from spaceports in Cornwall and Scotland, the first time missions have been launched from British soil. But these endeavours too will be truly international affairs with overseas companies and agencies working with the UK on both the launch sites and the satellites themselves.,Underpinning all these missions and programmes, however, is a far more deeply engrained internationalism. In 1958 the United Nations created a new Office for Outer Space Affairs.,It was just a year since the Soviet Union had launched Sputnik, the first artificial satellite of the Earth. The United States had responded with its Explorer 1 satellite a few months later and the space race between the two Cold War rivals was well underway. With humanity having breached the frontier of space the UN’s new Office was charged with running a newly created Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space.,To this day the Office manages the space treaties that enable the ‘orderly conduct of activities in outer space’. These cover such issues as ‘the freedom of exploration and use of space for the benefit and interest of all countries’ and ‘the non-appropriation of outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies.’ These agreements also commit nations ‘to assist an astronaut in case of accident, distress, emergency or unintended landing’. They have also established standards of liability for damage caused by space objects falling to the Earth. And for those who need to know what exactly is up there (approximately 6,000 satellites, functioning or dead at the last count) the treaties requires the space-faring nations of the world to register all objects launched into
outer space
.,As important is the programme of projects the UNOOSA oversees to encourage and help develop space applications for the benefit of people around the world.  Global health, environment, disaster monitoring and response, communication and transportation are but a few of the areas in which the Office provides assistance and guidance.,Space is essential for the achievement of the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals that guide global developmental efforts until 2030. Over 40% of these directly benefit from space applications and if one was to add telecommunications enabled by space the percentage would be higher still. UNOOSA works to help all countries access the enormous benefits of space and so help them advance on the
Sustainable Development Goals
.,And as we approach the third decade of the 21
st
century there is still more for the UNOOSA to consider and help manage as the number of nations, agencies and companies that can reach space increase dramatically.,The space sector is expanding rapidly, with new actors entering the arena and fast technological advancements opening new opportunities. In this increasingly complex environment, at UNOOSA we work to advance international cooperation among both established and emerging space actors, to ensure space is an inclusive arena and that its benefits reach everyone, everywhere.,International cooperation to facilitate the development and use of space applications is essential to address the common challenges we face on earth, from climate change to disaster risk reduction. Furthermore, it is our duty to preserve space for future generations, and international cooperation is essential to protect space as a global commons and ensure its long-term sustainable use. – UNOOSA Director Simonetta Di Pippo, 25 November, 2020,Fifty two years ago this Christmas the crew of Apollo 8 looked back on their home planet from lunar orbit. The photographs Bill Anders took as Earth appeared in all its majesty and beauty from behind the barren Moon lodged in the human psyche. Subsequent missions repeated the shots which are now known collectively and simply as ‘Earthrise’.,All those years ago space exploration enabled us, for the very first time, to look back on our place in space as one world where international borders are all but invisible. It is heartening that half a century on the very process of exploring space sets as good an example as any of how international collaboration can achieve far more than the sum of its parts."

showed you
the
Rolex
wristwatch that went seven miles down to the bottom of the Marianas Trench, in the Pacific Ocean, in 1960. Let’s stay with the nautical theme with this marine chronometer.,Chronometers, as I’ve
said before
, were the timekeeping devices carried on board every ship from about 1810 to the 1980s to help navigate. The
Royal Observatory Greenwich
is the place to go for the
whole chronometer story
, but we too have some rather nice ones in our
Measuring Time
gallery.,Most ships navigate using
GPS
these days, but I know quite a few amateur and recreational sailors who still navigate with the chronometer method. They tend to use their wristwatch because modern quartz watches keep time just fine for longitude purposes.,The chronometer I just showed you (by luxury Swiss watchmakers
Patek Philippe
, whose remarkable factory in Geneva I once had the pleasure of visiting) is one of a small number of quartz versions produced in the 1970s and 1980s. They were more accurate than their mechanical counterparts but were often boxed to look similar. Their days were numbered, though, as GPS started to take off.,But the maritime world is getting increasingly concerned about the vulnerability of GPS to jamming. Last year, a major exercise off the coast of Tynemouth took place to demonstrate how many systems could be affected in the event of hostile GPS signal jamming.

about Louis Blériot’s historic crossing of the English Channel a century ago. Blériot’s journey is rightly considered a momentous event in aviation history, but it wasn’t the first flight across. That happened 225 years ago this week.,Whilst Blériot had a powered, heavier-than-air craft, on 7 January 1785,

A bit of artistic licence, there. Whilst the first steamboat trials were indeed being carried out in the 1770s and 1780s, practical paddle-steamer services weren’t launched until the early nineteenth century.,Still, what a remarkable experience it must have been for the two men. The journey from England to France took about four-and-a-half hours and came just over a year after

",Collections and Objects,"astronomy,computing","This Saturday (24 October), we’re launching our Cosmic Collections website ‘mash-up’ competition. Just in case anyone else is as baffled as me, I asked our Lead Web Developer, Mia Ridge, a few questions about the competition.,For the non-geeks out there, what’s a mash-up?,A mashup is a website or application that combines separate data sources and/or visualisation tools into a single integrated interface.,A really useful example is
moveflat
– you can search for housing by
bus route
or on a
map of London
.  The site mashes up data provided in housing ads with StreetMap and GoogleMaps so that the interface just works for the site visitor.,Why did you decide to run a mash-up competition for
Cosmos & Culture
?
The idea of a mashup just seemed a perfect match for this exhibition.,Over the past few years there’s been a lot of discussion in cultural heritage technology
forums
about the need for
APIs
(instructions and methods for computers to request content and functions from each other) in museums. Some museums have released APIs, but it’s been difficult to find out how much real demand there is from non-museum programmers – I thought this would be one way to find out.,A comparatively small budget for web work in the original project meant we risked producing a bland museum microsite that might not do the objects and their stories justice.  There are so many ways of looking at these objects – as pieces of industrial design, as examples of the way we tell stories about the night sky, as artefacts from the history of science and technology, as personal items belonging to explorers and innovators, as beautiful objects in their own right… opening up the data to let people create their own sites seemed like a good way to enable other people to show us the collections as they see them.,I knew there was an active online astronomy community, and that sites like
Galaxy Zoo
had ‘crowdsourced’ the classifications of galaxies, leading to some
new discoveries
.  One of the key messages of the exhibition was that amateur astronomers can still make important contributions, and that seemed to be a good match with the idea of encouraging people use our data in their own research.,Converting some of our web budget into prize money seemed like a concrete way of recognising the contributions and work of people working with our content.,How ground-breaking is it for a museum?,As far as I know, we’re the first museum to run a competition to crowd-source the creation of an exhibition site like this.,A few museums
have produced APIs or published other ways to programmatically access their data and there have been lots of mashup competitions and hack days in the private and public sector but the combination is new. I’m very lucky – when I approached the curator with my idea, she could have thought I was being just a bit too experimental, but she decided to give it a go.,What might the finished mash-ups look like?,Good question!  I have absolutely no idea – which is both exciting and scary. Typically, mashups might use timelines or maps, but there’s some
amazing
visualisation
work
going on and tools like IBM’s
Many Eyes
make them really easy.,I’m hoping that the final submission date won’t be the end of it – we’d like to help build a community of developers who are interested in working with museum content. I’ll also be using the competition to work out how we can improve our collections API, and as input to on-going experiments with our online collections. I’m taking the approach of small experiments and iterative development that I can fit in around bigger project deadlines, partly because it’s a good match for the available resources and partly to test the benefits of a more agile approach.,If you have more questions for Mia please post them as comments below.

of

I introduced Malcolm Campbell, who broke land and water speed records in the 1920s and 30s using vehicles named ‘Blue Bird’. One of his successful
record-breaking attempts
took place in February 1931 when he topped 245 miles per hour. Here’s our model of his car:,Later that year, he decided to go for a ride in a somewhat slower car – a
1905 Rolls-Royce numbered AX148
. This venerable old motor, with a top speed of 30mph, was one of the first
Rolls-Royce
cars ever made, and in November 1931 Campbell took the driving seat for its entry in the
London to Brighton run
.,These ten-horse-power motor cars were made between 1904 and 1906 by the manufacturing company of
Henry Royce
, who had recently joined forces with
Charles Rolls
to make cars under the brand ‘Rolls-Royce’. A motoring legend was born.,To start with, AX148 was used by Royce himself, as early sales were slow (and he needed a runabout). Its first buyer was a chap called Paris Singer (son of sewing-machine magnate
Isaac Singer
) who bought it in 1906. It was his second; he’d been Royce’s first ever customer back in 1904. Clearly he liked these cars! We’ve one of his father’s original machines on show:,After a couple of changes of ownership, AX148 was bought back by Rolls-Royce in 1935 and presented to the
Science Museum

lent it

It’s a bit different to the sleek Inspiration car that raced this week!,At the turn of the twentieth century, as the car started to gain popularity, it was steam and electric vehicles that far outsold
internal combustion engine
(ICE) ones.,Then with advances in ICE cars such as starter motors  (rather than hand-cranks that could break your arm if you weren’t careful), things switched around. Today, steam cars seem quaint and electric cars seem brand new. But things could have been very different.,More on our electric car collection another time, but here’s a couple of pictures of some of our other steam cars (not on show at the Wroughton festival, sadly):"

since J. K. Starley’s ‘Rover’ safety bicycle hit the scene in the 1880s. The Moulton is a small-wheel, compact cycle with full suspension that is easy to ride, mount and store.,I’d never ridden one, so I arranged to use the Wroughton staff bike (which is a Moulton) to get from the entrance gate to the hangar I was filming in.

Outreach Team
, it’s our job to travel the country (and sometimes the world) bringing exciting science shows and workshops into classrooms, school halls, fields and town centres.,We are often asked about what our favourite shows are, and everyone in the team has their own particular choice. But, our most popular show by far is most certainly The Bubble Show, last year we performed 149 of them!,So with that in mind, we thought we’d share a few of our bubble secrets. To make your bubble mix you will need:,We add glycerol (sometimes sold as glycerine) to our mix because it slows down the evaporation of the water. This means the bubbles can last longer and the bubble mix is great for making really big bubbles too. Remember, most of the mix is water, with only a small amount of washing-up liquid and glycerol – experiment with different proportions and see how your bubbles change.,You can buy glycerol from a high- street chemist but if you can’t get hold of any, sugar does the job as well. Just dissolve it in some warm water and add a little to your bubble mix. Sugar will make your bubbles sticky though!,Once you have your lovely bucket of bubble mix you can start to make bubbles using all sorts of things, here are a few ideas.,Why not make your own bubble trumpet?,,Or how about a giant bubble wand using a coat hanger?
Have a look around the house and see what else you could use to make bubbles. Old tennis racquets are great for making lots of little bubbles all at once, even straws or plastic cups with the bottom cut off are great for blowing bubbles.,Check
out this printable guide
for making even more bubble-blowing devices.,Did you know…,Bubbles are very colourful, but just before they pop they can appear to turn black.
Bubbles will always try to form a sphere shape, this shape requires the least amount of energy as it reduces the surface area.,The world record for the largest free-floating bubble was set by Jarom Watts in 2009, his bubble was 13.67m

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/crew-dragon/,Doug Millard,Crew Dragon – back to the age of the space capsule,"As we celebrate the launch of the Crew Dragon and two NASA astronauts to the International Space Station, Space Curator Doug Millard looks back at the history of the space capsule. ",Science in the news,"1969 Moon landing,Apollo 10,Apollo Mission,Exploring Space,nasa,space","We start back in October 1968 when NASA launched a new type of spacecraft. It was Apollo 7 and was the first Apollo mission to carry a crew into space. For over a week, whilst in Earth orbit, crew Walter Cunningham, Wally Shirra and Donn Eisele put it through its paces.,It was also the first crewed flight of the Apollo command module, a cone-shaped spacecraft that would later be capable of carrying astronauts to the Moon and returning them safely to the Earth. It is said that this mission was part of the final countdown towards
the historic lunar landing carried out less than a year later by Edwin ‘Buzz’ Aldrin and Neil Armstrong.,NASA’s next spacecraft design was
the space shuttle
, a partly re-useable winged spaceplane that could ferry astronauts,and satellites into Earth orbit.  Between the first launch on April 12, 1981, and the final landing on July 21, 2011, NASA’s space shuttle fleet – Columbia, Challenger, Discovery, Atlantis and Endeavour – flew 135 missions and helped construct the International Space Station.,Despite being the most sophisticated spacecraft ever built, the programme did not achieve its primary aim to make spaceflight more inexpensive.,Since 2011,  the only way crews from any nation, the United States included, have been able to reach the International Space Station is by way of the Russian Soyuz rocket and spacecraft.,Now, NASA is about to launch a brand-new spacecraft that bears more than a passing resemblance to the old Apollo capsules –  just even more bullet-shaped.,It is called
Crew Dragon
and has been built under contract to NASA by
SpaceX
. Its first crewed launch is due today (27 May 2020) and will carry astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken to the International Space Station for a three-month stay before bringing them back home.,Crew Dragon Demo-2, the full name of this mission, will be launched on a
SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket
that will be recovered to be used again. Like its rocket, Crew Dragon is also designed to be reusable but will splashdown in the ocean where the salty water may well interfere – it was originally designed to touch back down on land using its retro rockets and parachutes,It is bigger than the original Apollo command module – capable of carrying seven astronauts to Apollo’s three, and it incorporates all the advances in computing and light-weight materials you might expect in the half-century since the Moon missions.,However, Crew Dragon is not alone. Another NASA contract has supported
Boeing’s Starliner
, a space capsule that looks very similar to the original Apollo module, that also has the potential to reach the International Space Station. NASA itself is producing the
Orion spacecraft,
another cone-like module which has the potential to take humans further than they have ever been before promising to reach as far as Mars.  Even the venerable Russian Soyuz will eventually be replaced with a new spacecraft.,All of these are variants of the cone-like design made famous by the Apollo missions and all signal a return to the age of the space capsule."

Ten years earlier in May 1980 Namco began public testing of its new arcade game
Puck Man
. Initial feedback was positive and so later that year Namco took its new title to trade shows around the world. After a quick name change (courtesy of American Execs at Midway fearing what vandals might change the title to)
Pac-Man
hit the arcades.,The US welcomed this new title and
Pac-Man
became a huge success in the growing number of arcades around the country. Within a year more than 100,000 arcade units had been sold grossing more than $1 billion in quarters. Part of the reason for this success was the universal appeal. Creator Toru Iwatani felt that arcade games at the time were often violent and appealed mainly to men. He wanted to create a non-violent game, hoping that his game would attract women and couples to the arcades. The then-revolutionary RGB colour displays allowed Iwatani and his team to create attractive characters with bright colours which helped bring new fans to gaming.,Pac-Man is joined on screen by a collection of ghosts who chase him around the maze as he tries to gobble up dots. Familiar to Western audiences by their nicknames the four main ghosts are Blinky, Inky, Pinky and Clyde. These ghosts were each programmed with a different personality and their Japanese names were hints to their behaviour. While Oikaké (chaser) always chases Pac-Man around the maze, Kimaguré (fickle) is fickle, chasing or ambushing Pac-Man and sometimes just wandering off.,After his arcade success, Pac-Man was converted to consoles for home video game audiences. Over the following 40 years, there has been a host of sequels, spin-offs, rip-offs and remakes. Pac-Man has featured in over 80 games selling upwards of 43 million units, worth over $14 billion. Along the way he has entered the 3D world, featured in all number of game genres and introduced us to his family Ms. Pac-Man, Jr. Pac-Man and Baby Pac-Man. His impact has taken him outside of the world of games to star in cartoons, have hit singles, feature in films and get his own playable
Google Doodle
.,It hasn’t always been a story of success for Pac-Man, however. At the height of popularity in 1982 the Atari 2600 conversion was criticised for its bad-quality and odd design choices. Atari had produced 12 million cartridges but only managed to sell 7 million. This in part led to Atari’s demise, the videogames crash of 1983 and the rumoured burial of thousands of unsold cartridges in a secret landfill site.,Perhaps the biggest challenge out there for fans of Pac-Man remains the achievement of a perfect score on the original game. The game’s 256
th
level has a glitch making it unplayable, meaning it’s possible to hit a high score of 3,333,360 points by eating all the dots, fruits and ghosts. Fewer than ten people have achieved this on an original arcade unit, the fastest entering the record books in 3 hours, 28 minutes and 49 seconds.,With several Guinness World Records and dozens of games to his name the impact of Pac-Man, partially designed to look like a pizza with a slice missing, is huge. The sequel
Ms. Pac-Man
is one of the first video games to feature a female lead character and the franchise’s non-violent, colourful puzzles have made gaming accessible to people the world round. Pac-Man has served as the inspiration for games and games designers for 40 years and looks likely to continue for many years to come.,While many of us are currently spending more time at home you might like to test your own skills at playing and creating a Pac-Man game. The
World’s Biggest Pac-Man
is an online resource where you can design your own maze and play on mazes created by others. With over half a million mazes to play on, users have so far eaten over 263 million ghosts and over 20 billion dots."

As an example of both the challenges and wonder of this game he pointed to the time between the recent discovery of the Higgs boson, celebrated in our Collider exhibition and the papers by Peter Higgs and others that had first postulated its existence. Or as Professor Dijkraaf put it, “the five decades before this idea, crazy enough to be true, became reality”.,Professor Dijkgraaf spoke of scientists’ duty engage the public by sharing their “stories and fascination, latest insights and discoveries” adding that he couldn’t think of a more appropriate location to do so than the museum, since “the universe cannot wish for a more perceptive eye than the Science Museum”.

evidence
that women and minorities face an uphill struggle in UK science. As one sign of the prevailing concern, 600 people joined us this morning for the launch of Your Life, which includes a three year exhibition at the Science Museum.,Fewer than 20% of 16-19 year olds take A-Level Maths and half of mixed state schools have no girls study A-Level Physics in 2011. ‘Only two per cent of girls are doing physics A level. That is not good enough. That is something we have got to change,’ said the Chancellor.,Surrounded by some of the most important objects in the history of science, in the museum’s
Making the Modern World
gallery, the Chancellor spoke about the need to inspire the next generation.,He told the audience that ‘all my life’ he had been visiting the Science Museum. ‘I bring my children to this museum and when you see all the incredible exhibits here, the steam engines, aircraft, early electricity generation and spacecraft, it is easy to think this happened in Britain’s past….that is not true.,One of the key things we are trying to challenge in this campaign is the idea that science engineering and design are all part of Britain’s great industrial past, not our future’,As one example of how Britain is contributing to the future, he singled out the museum’s
Collider
exhibition, which celebrates the achievements of a vast army of scientists at the Large Hadron Collider in finding the Higgs particle, due to open at the
Museum of Science and Industry
in Manchester later this month.,To help meet this challenge of attracting more students to careers in STEM, the Science Museum’s director, Ian Blatchford, announced a major three-year exhibition, backed by leading companies and the Royal Academy of Engineering. Watch this space for more news over the coming months.,Mr Blatchford pointed out how of the
3.4 million visitors
to the Science Museum, half are women, and that the museum plays a key role in inspiring people to study STEM, for instance with its festivals celebrating the role of women in fields such as
Formula 1
, energy,
space and aeronautics
.,Education Minister Liz Truss MP praised the ‘fantastic turnout’ at the museum echoed the Chancellor’s words, citing the common Chinese saying “science and maths can get us everywhere.”,Too many teenagers, especially girls, don’t realise this, she added, saying she wants to ‘eradicate science deserts….if we get this right, the opportunities will be huge.’,The Museum  is one of over 170 businesses, universities, schools and organisations supporting the
Your Life campaign

Yet they enabled one of the most momentous projects in human history – the launch of astronaut John Glenn into orbit.,,Hidden Figures
tells the story of Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson, who worked at NASA in the 1950s and early ’60s as part of a team of so-called ‘human computers’. Their job was to calculate the launch and landing coordinates for the experimental rockets being built at the dawn of the space race. Later they would channel their formidable mathematical abilities into programming the first mainframe computers. However, for much of the film they are depicted performing highly complex calculations with a pen and paper – often more precisely than the mainframe.,Katherine Johnson
, working with NASA’s Space Task Group, made some of the key breakthroughs that enabled a successful launch and return to Earth for astronaut John Glenn’s Mercury-Atlas 6 mission. Glenn – later a US Senator – became the first American to orbit the Earth and the mission paved the way for the later Apollo and Space Shuttle programmes, both of which Katherine Johnson worked on.,Mary Jackson
became so fascinated by the rocket-building project that she retrained as an engineer and went on to become NASA’s first black female engineer. She had to break down more than one glass ceiling to achieve this, petitioning a court to be allowed to attend night school at Hampton High School, which was still segregated at that time.,Dorothy Vaughan
not only taught herself FORTRAN in order to be able to programme the mainframes but she also trained her colleagues in this new programming language. By ensuring that they would be ready for the future, she led a team at the forefront of computing technology decades before computers were available to the general public.,Why does this matter? And why this week? Because even now, 60 years after the Russians launched the space race with their first satellite,
Sputnik
, only
9%
of UK engineers are women and only
6%
are from black and minority ethnic backgrounds.,Today (23 June) is
International Women in Engineering Day
(#INWED17). Established in 2014 as a national event, it proved so empowering to women in the profession that it has evolved into an international event this year. UK events include Jaguar Land Rover’s Gorillaz App Challenge in the West Midlands, in which participants will try assembling Jaguar’s first all-electric five-seater sports car, the Jaguar I-PACE Concept. An online
Save an Engineer
debate will ask an audience to choose which young female engineer should win a chance to enter a new world: ‘there has been an apocalypse and there is one last spot on the boat that will sail away to start a new beginning’.,The special screening of the film took place at the Science Museum on 19 June in partnership with Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment, the

, chaired the panel.,“We need lots more creative people coming into engineering careers,” said Maggie. “Engineering is joy.” The panel agreed. “We owe it to the
Hidden Figures
women and others like them to continue fighting the battle for equality”, said Abbie. Nelson emphasised that diversity and inclusion is a business imperative and encouraged companies to act: “people talk the talk but they don’t always walk the walk,” he said. Anita spoke of the need to provide more role models to encourage diversity, and for companies to allow more flexible working arrangements for employees with family responsibilities. All agreed that mentoring is vital: “Think about your workplace,” said Roma, “is there any way you can better support people around you from minority groups?”,The event was introduced by Academy President and Fellow of the Science Museum Dame Ann Dowling. Next week, Dame Ann will explore why girls make the subject and career choices they do when she takes over Radio 4’s
Woman’s Hour

on Wednesday 28 June. She will also discuss the huge breadth of modern engineering – from medical imaging and therapy, to wi-fi and mobile phones. Dame Ann will also be combining her research on aircraft noise with her passion for opera, as she discusses the power of the human voice.,The power of the #INWED17 message this week could not be clearer: the engineering profession invites women and men of all backgrounds to join in as we reach for the stars.

are pretty remarkable.,I think it’s useful for museums to draw attention to material in
store
– both to explore the strangeness and explain the significance of holding material in storage for perpetuity, as well as to highlight the particular riches to be found behind the scenes. Objects of course convey multiple meanings. Museums as well aren’t homogenous, so perhaps the most fascinating aspect of the project are the different perspectives each partner brings to the same object.,First Time Out opens with home objects on display from 6

Trephination set circa 1770-1830,In Ancient Egypt, skull scrapings were used to create potions. Both Hippocrates and Galen mentioned the procedure, and it would continue throughout the Middle Ages and into the Renaissance with many people surviving, as seen in archaeological excavations where trepanned skulls show signs of healing around the edge of the hole.,,3500-years ago, this patient survived the trephination,There are several possible explanations for this procedure:,Although disregarded by many, the practice still exists in contemporary medicine, but is used mostly for the treatment of epidural and subdural haematoma (a ruptured blood vessel between the skull and the brain.),Some
people today
still have the procedure carried out, with many purporting its benefits in increased levels of consciousness or intellectual capacity.,,,An example of a trephination set can be seen in The Science and Art of Medicine, 5

nitrous oxide
, popularly known as ‘laughing gas’.,Davy experimented with euphoria-inducing properties of the gas with his friends Samuel Taylor Coleridge and James Watt. Davy was working at the Pneumatic Institution, set up by Thomas Beddoes to investigate the medical properties of inhaled or ‘factitous airs’. Davy pursued his experiments – part scientific, part recreational – with his normal con brio and was fortunate not to have seriously damaged his and others’ health.,My dentist, alongside doctors and medics, has long employed nitrous oxide as an analgesic, to relax patients and as a prelude to anaesthesia.,And Mike Melvill? Well, as pilot of
SpaceShipOne
, the world’s first privately developed spacecraft, he depended on its ability to oxidise rocket fuel for the thrust that carried him spaceward on his pioneering sub-orbital flight of 2004.,So nitrous oxide has a variety of uses but it also has a dark side. Whether produced naturally or by industrial activity it leads to ozone depletion of the upper atmosphere. This lets in more of the Sun’s harmful ultra-violet radiation which the ozone molecules normally absorb. Plus, nitrous oxide acts as a particularly effective greenhouse gas, trapping the heat re-radiated from the Earth’s surface and causing global temperature rises.,No laughing matter indeed."

Kathleen Lonsdale
, who in 1945 became the first woman to be elected a Fellow of the
Royal Society
, along with microbiologist
Marjory Stephenson
(only 285 years after the men).,Lonsdale was a pioneer in the field of X-ray crystallography, in which scientists fire X-rays at crystals and study how they are scattered. This enables them to infer how atoms are arranged inside the crystal.,In the early days, it was an arduous process. Capturing X-rays on film could result in burns to the fingers. Calculating the atomic layout from the X-ray patterns had to be done manually, involving hours of slogging. Things got somewhat easier with the advent of scientific computing. The Pegasus computer on display in our Computing gallery (the world’s oldest working electronic computer) was used by Lonsdale’s group at University College London.,Lonsdale faced the additional challenge of being a woman in a man’s world, and for a time struggled to combine scientific work with raising a family. Her mentor
William Henry Bragg
arranged for a grant to help support her at home so that she could carry out her world-class research. Lonsdale said that to succeed as a woman scientist one must be a first-class organiser, work twice the usual hours, and learn to concentrate in any available moment of time.,In the early-to-mid 20th century, the field of X-ray crystallography was unusual in having a number of high-profile women scientists, including Lonsdale,
Helen Megaw
, Rosalind Franklin, whose X-ray photograph of DNA was infamously used by Crick and Watson in determining the double helix structure, and Nobel prizewinner
Dorothy Hodgkin

2010 report
suggests that, in the UK at least, the picture’s still not so rosy – despite an increase in females studying science, technology and medicine, women still only make up 12% of the workforce. And women are noticeably absent as the
famous faces of science

Collider: step inside the world’s greatest experiment
opens in November 2013 with a behind-the-scenes look at the famous CERN particle physics laboratory.,The air brimmed with excitement on this momentous day. The discovery of the particle confirmed a theory that had taken years to devise, and justified the toil of hundreds of scientists.,You might think I’m referring to the
Higgs boson
– the particle that explains mass, discovered at the LHC last year. But thirty years ago this month, another event shaped modern physics – the discovery of the
Z boson
.,In the 1960s, physicists predicted the Z and W bosons, as a way to link the electromagnetic and weak forces. There was plenty of evidence the theory was correct, but the lynchpin would be the discovery of the Z boson.,To make a Z boson, two particles are smashed together. The energy of the crash creates new, heavy particles. If a Z boson is produced, it sticks around for only a fraction of a second before it decays into other particles. To claim the prize of discovering the Z boson, physicists would need to be able to forensically reconstruct what happens in a collision, never seeing the Z directly.,Europe and America built machines to discover the Z, including the
Super Proton Synchrotron
(SPS) at CERN. “The idea of creating this massive object (the Z) and letting it decay…was a riveting idea (well at least for me in the late 1970s),” said Crispin Williams, a physicist who now works on the ALICE experiment at the LHC.,Two CERN physicists, effusive Italian Carlo Rubbia and Dutchman Simon Van der Meer, realised that to beat the firepower of the newly-opened Tevatron in Chicago, the SPS had to take risks. The pair devised an audacious plan; rather than fire beams onto a fixed object, they would collide two opposing beams, each only a hair’s width across and both travelling at almost the speed of light.,What’s more, one of the beams would be made of antimatter, which destroys ordinary matter. Creating and manipulating a beam of antimatter was a revolutionary concept.,Williams remembers when Rubbia and Van der Meer announced their plan to collide two beams. “This was to a packed auditorium at CERN and I suspect that most people thought he was out of his mind,” said Williams.,Despite the technical challenge, the new collider worked. One visitor to CERN in 1982 described the intense excitement the new development created. “I went to the CERN cafeteria for a coffee and there I saw something that I had not noticed before. There was a monitor on the wall and people were watching the screen with great interest. The monitor was showing the rate of proton–antiproton collisions in CERN’s latest challenge – a bold venture designed to produce the intermediate bosons, W and Z.”,In January 1983, the risk-takers received their reward, when the W boson was discovered.  On 1
st
June 1983, scientists at CERN announced they had seen five Z bosons in their detectors.,The route to the discovery had revolutionised particle physics, with more intricate detectors and the ability to manipulate antimatter. For Williams, the discovery of the Higgs boson was much less elegant. “In comparison the Higgs at the LHC is just brute force,” he said.  “Maybe I am just getting old and cynical: and I look back at the Z discovery through rose tinted glasses.”"

, a Physicist working on the LHCb experiment and the first Science Museum Fellow of Modern Science, writes about a recent discovery at CERN. A new
Collider
exhibition opens in November 2013, taking a behind-the-scenes look at the famous particle physics laboratory.,On Friday afternoon, at the EPS conference in Stockholm, two colleagues of mine from
CERN
stood up to announce that the search for one of the rarest processes in fundamental physics is over. The result is a stunning success for the
Standard Model
, our current best theory of particles and forces, and yet another blow for those hoping for signs of new physics from CERN’s Large Hadron Collider (
LHC
).,The
LHCb
and
CMS
experiments at the LHC have made the first definitive observation of a particle called a B
s
meson decaying into two muons, confirming a tentative sighting at LHCb (my experiment)
last autumn
. The discovery has far-reaching implications for the search for new particles and forces of nature.,Beyond the Standard Model,There are a lot of reasons to suspect that the current
Standard Model
isn’t the end of the story when it comes to the building blocks of our Universe. Despite agreeing with almost every experimental measurement to date, it has several gaping holes. It completely leaves out the force of gravity and has no explanation for the enigmatic
dark matter
and dark energy that are thought to make up 95% of the Universe. The theory also requires a large amount of “fine-tuning” to match experimental observations, leaving it looking suspiciously like the laws of physics have been tinkered with in a very unnatural way to produce the Universe we live in.,In the last few decades a number of theories have been put forward that attempt to solve some of the Standard Model’s problems. One particularly popular idea is supersymmetry (SUSY for short), which proposes a slew of new fundamental particles, each one a mirror image of the particles of the Standard Model.,SUSY has many attractive features: it provides a neat explanation for dark matter and unifies the strengths of the three forces of the Standard Model (this suggests that they could all be aspects of one unified force, which should definitely be referred to as
The Force
, if it turns out to exist someday). It would also keep my colleagues in work for decades to come, thanks to a whole new load of super-particles (or
sparticles
) to discover and study.,However, physicists were first attracted to it because the theory is aesthetically pleasing. Unlike the Standard Model, SUSY doesn’t require any awkward fine-tuning to produce laws of physics that match our experience. This is not a very scientific argument, more a desire amongst physicists for theories to be elegant, but historically it has often been the case that the most beautiful theory turns out to be right one.,On the hunt,The decay observed at LHCb and CMS is predicted to be extremely rare in the Standard Model, with a B
s
meson only decaying into two muons about 3 times in every billion. However, if ideas like SUSY are correct than the chances of the decay can be significantly boosted.,Finding particle decays this rare makes hunting for a needle in a haystack seem like a doddle. Hundreds of millions of collisions take place every second at the LHC, each one producing hundreds of new particles that leave electrical signals in the giant detectors. Physicists from LHCb and CMS trawled through two years worth of data, searching untold trillions of collisions for signs of two muons coming from a B
s
meson. The pressure to be the first to find evidence of this rare process was intense, as Dr. Marc-Olivier Bettler, a colleague of mine from
Cambridge
and member of the LHCb team told me.,“It is a very strange type of race. To avoid bias, we don’t allow ourselves to look at the data until the last minute. So it’s a bit like running blindfolded – you can’t see the landscape around you or your competitors, even though you know that they’re there, so you have no idea if you are doing well or not! You only find out after you cross the finish line.”,However, ultimately the race ended in a draw. Neither LHCb nor CMS alone had enough data to announce a formal discovery, each turning up just a handful of likely candidates. But when their results are formally combined next week it is expected that the number of observed decays will pass the all-important “five sigma” level, above which a discovery can be declared.,Standard Model Stands Firm,In a blow for supporters of SUSY, LHCb and CMS observed the decay occurring at exactly the rate predicted by the Standard Model – approximately 3 times in a billion. This is yet another triumph for the Standard Model and kills off a number of the most popular SUSY theories.,Professor Val Gibson, leader of the Cambridge particle physics group and member of the LHCb experiment explained that,
“
Measurements of this very rare decay significantly squeeze the places new physics can hide. We are now looking forward to the LHC returning at even higher energy and to an upgrade of the experiment so that we can investigate why new physics is so shy.”,This result is certainly not the end of the road for ideas like supersymmetry, which has many different versions. However, combined with the recent discovery of the Higgs boson (whose mass is larger than predicted by many SUSY theories) this new result may only leave us with versions of SUSY that are somewhat inelegant, meaning that the original motivation – a natural description of nature – is lost.,This new result from CERN is yet another demonstration of the fantastic (and somewhat annoying) accuracy of the Standard Model. Incredible precision is now being achieved by experiments at the LHC, allowing physicists to uncover ever-rarer particles and phenomena. If ideas like supersymmetry are to survive the onslaught of high precision tests made by the LHC experiments, we may have to accept that we live in a spookily fine-tuned Universe."

Adam Hampshire describes the results of a global project and how you can get involved. ",Science in the news,brain,"By Adam Hampshire, Brain and Mind Institute, University of Western Ontario,To what extent are some people smarter than others? For a century, psychologists have believed that we can boil differences in cognitive skill down to a single number known as an Intelligence Quotient (
IQ
). But does one number really represent an individual’s ability to remember, to reason and to think? The answer is an emphatic no, according to the results of a
landmark experiment
conducted on many tens of thousands of people with the help of
Roger Highfield
of the Science Museum Group.,With Roger and my colleague Adrian Owen, who works with me at the University of Western Ontario, I describe our findings today in the journal
Neuron
.,Our  attempt to answer this simple question dates back more than five years, when Roger encountered work that I had conducted with Adrian at the
Medical Research Council
in Cambridge on a reliable way to carry out cognitive tests online so we could monitor rehabilitation after brain injury, the effect of smart drug trials and so on.,Roger wondered if we could use this test to carry out a mass intelligence test. Drawing on earlier data from brain scans,  Adrian and I came up with a series of tests which we knew would trigger activity in as much of the brain’s anatomy as possible, combining the fewest tasks to cover the broadest range of cognitive skills.,In half an hour, respondents had to complete 12 cognitive tests which look at memory, reasoning, attention and planning abilities, as well as a fill in a survey about their background and lifestyle habits (Roger and Adrian describe the tests
here
).,We expected a few hundred responses. But thanks to articles in Discovery and
New Scientist
, 110,000 people took part from every corner of the world. Once I had used statistical methods to analyse more than a million data points on a representative group of around 45,000, I found that when a wide range of cognitive abilities are probed, the variations in performance can only be explained with at least three distinct components: short-term memory; reasoning; and finally, a verbal component.,No one component, or ‘IQ’, explained all the variations revealed by the tests.,To bolster our results, Adrian and I used a $5 million brain scanner, which relies on a technique known as functional magnetic resonance imaging (
fMRI
), to study 16 participants as they carried out all 12 tests.  We found that each of the three different factors identified by the analysis did indeed correspond to a different brain network: these differences in cognitive ability map onto three distinct circuits in the brain.,The results disprove once and for all the idea that a single measure of intelligence, such as ‘IQ’, is enough to capture all of the differences in cognitive ability that we see between people. Instead, several different brain circuits contribute to intelligence, each with its own unique capacity. A person may well be good in one of these areas, but they are just as likely to be bad in the other two.,Because so many people took part, the
results
also provided a wealth of information about how factors such as age, gender and the tendency to play computer games influence our brain function.,For example, people who regularly played computer games did perform significantly better in terms of both reasoning and short-term memory. Smokers performed poorly on the short-term memory and the verbal factors, while people who frequently suffer from anxiety performed badly on the short-term memory factor in particular.,We are now launching a new version of the tests, to ensure we do not bias the results of the new tests, we can’t say much about the agenda other than that there are many more fascinating questions about the true nature of intelligence that we want to answer.,Adam Hampshire works at the

So when I saw this giant steam powered hammer looming over me in
Making the Modern World
I had to learn more.,It was invented by
James Hall Nasmyth
. He was born in 1808, and drawn to mechanics from a young age, making his first steam engine at the age of 17.,He forged a successful career making industrial machinery – at least after an early setback when a piece of his iron work broke through the wooden floor of his workshop and landed in the glass cutters flat below.,The impetus for creating the steam hammer came in 1838 when the Great Western Company was experiencing problems making the Ship
SS Great Britain
. The company’s engineer, Francis Humphries, wrote to Nasmyth with a challenge: “I find there is not a forge-hammer in England or Scotland powerful enough to forge the paddle-shaft of the engine for the Great Britain! What am I to do?”,He’d come to the right man. Nasmyth patented the steam hammer in June 1842 and demonstrated it at
The
Great Exhibition of 1851
.
Well aware that the machine’s accuracy combined with its extraordinary power was a remarkable selling point, he set an egg resting on a glass under the hammer. When the hammer fell it broke the egg but not the glass.,He then reset the machine, and the hammer thudded down with a thump that shook the building.,Although Nasmyth patented the hammer, and built his reputation on it, the first one was actually built at Eugene Schneider’s Le Creusot Ironworks in France, before 1842. This may have been the result of Schneider visiting Nasmyth’s works while he was away, and being shown Nasmyth’s sketch for the as-yet-unbuilt hammer. Nasmyth discovered the hammer working when he later paid a return visit to Le Creusot, and had to rush through a patent on his return to England. Always keep your secret drawings under lock and key!,Nasmyth retired in 1856 announcing, “I have now enough of this world’s goods: let younger men have their chance”. He might have been done with worldly goods, but he certainly wasn’t done with science. More on that in my next post…"

",Collections and Objects,"physics,volunteers","Recently, searching the physics collections on our
object database
, I was intrigued by an entry for a ‘radiation detector built to detect bees marked with radium’. Some research from our wonderful
volunteer
Eduard revealed more.,The device was designed by
Gilbert Tomes
in the early 1940s. Tomes, a keen amateur apiarist, was seeking a way to track swarms by detecting when the queen bee left the hive. He tried tagging the queen with a tiny magnet to trigger a circuit as she left  – but as you might imagine, attaching magnets to bees was a tricky job.,Dabbing them with luminous paint proved somewhat easier, but Tomes’s photocell detector setup was triggered by other light sources as well as the painted bees. Then he remembered that the luminous paint contained radium (despite increasing awareness of its
dangers
from the early 20th century, radium paint was widely used in WW2-era instruments).,As part of their work for the Baird Television company, Tomes and his colleague Alec Tidmarsh had been investigating
Geiger-Muller tubes
, which at the time were little used outside scientific circles. They made a simple device to detect the radioactive bees, which they showed to
London Zoo
‘s head beekeeper. Impressed, he sent a story to the Press Association, and suddenly the ‘Tomes Queen Detector’ was big news.,Tomes and Tidmarsh were deluged with requests for their Geiger counters and a few years later
founded 20th Century Electronics
(now
Centronic
), which became a global leader in detector technology.,Perhaps the company’s success improved Tomes’s wife’s opinion of his bee research. In his diaries on 19 September 1941, Gilbert noted: ‘Feeding bees with sugar syrup.  This was rather a sticky business and Mary did not like her kitchen being taken over.  She wanted to know why we had to feed the bees when they were supposed to be feeding us with honey’."

Some people will be there because they believe the shroud is the burial cloth of Christ, others will be sceptics wanting a closer look at what has widely been dismissed as a medieval forgery.,A strong case against the shroud’s authenticity was made in 1998, when samples were
radiocarbon-dated
by three independent laboratories. This container in our nuclear physics collection was used to transport the sample that went to the University of Oxford’s
Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit
– the red wax is the Archbishop of Turin’s seal confirming that the sample came from the shroud. The Oxford experiments concluded that the sample was around 750 years old, in broad agreement with the results from the other laboratories.,Seemingly conclusive evidence that the shroud is from the Middle Ages and not the time of Christ. But some people have argued that there may be other explanations, for example the shroud being
contaminated
during centuries of storage, or the samples having been taken from a
medieval repair patch
on a much older artefact.,Further testing may help to pin down the age of the fabric, although so far the Catholic Church has been reluctant to expose this iconic artefact to further study. And an agreed age still wouldn’t explain
how the image of the man was formed
– and certainly not who that man was. During his visit the Pope was
careful to remain non-committal

.,The most striking thing about the majority of these spectacles was their size. The glasses have tiny lenses which I can imagine were quite difficult to see through. The one pair I have chosen to focus on is a pair with double folding blue lenses which gave extra protection to the eyes.,The lenses on these steel wire spectacles protect the front and sides of the eye. They are tinted blue to protect from the sun. The spectacle arms are pivoted at the temple and can rotate 360 degrees. They are known as turnpin spectacles. These types of glasses where very popular  during the late 1700s and early 1800s, and even the famous composer

.,The event heralded
a ‘Brave Moo World’
according to Channel 4.,To create the hamburger, muscle cells taken from the shoulder muscle of a cow and multiplied to form muscle tissue, the main component of beef.,The cells arranged themselves into tiny ‘myotubes’ which are grown around gel hubs, attached to Velcro ‘anchor points’ in a culture dish.  Electrical stimulation was then used to make the muscle strips contract and ‘bulk up’.,With this technique, a single strand can produce over a trillion new strands. And when all these tiny pieces are added together, tissue is the result; it took 20,000 of these small strands of meat to create one normal sized hamburger.,Other ingredients include salt, egg powder, and breadcrumbs. Beetroot juice and saffron were added to provide authentic beef colouring.,One reason Brin is backing this project is that the
Food and Agriculture Organization
of the United Nations estimates that the demand for meat is going to increase by more than two-thirds in the next four decades and current production methods are not sustainable.,Livestock also contributes to global warming through
releases of methane
, a greenhouse gas 20 times more potent than carbon dioxide, via belching and farting.,According to Prof Post, research carried out at the University of Oxford suggests that producing cultured, or in vitro, beef could use as much as 99% less space than current livestock farming methods and will have smaller emissions."

Climate Science Outreach Project
– a three year project run by the museum in partnership with the
National Railway Museum
in York,
Museum of Science and Industry
in Manchester,
At-Bristol
science centre and the
Catalyst Science Discovery Centre
.,The nationwide project was designed to inspire 13-14 year olds on the subject of climate change by equipping them with the skills to become climate ambassadors in their schools and communities. During each year of the project, schools were set a different challenge – allowing students to explore aspects of climate change on which they felt enthusiastic.,At the end of each year, the Science Museum turned the students’ finished work into a public exhibition or product, giving students an enormous sense of pride in their own achievements.,In year one, students were asked to create their own pieces of Sci-art on a climate change theme. Among the incredible artworks were a giant hand showing the five countries contributing the most towards carbon emissions and a homeless polar pear begging on the streets. The project was turned into a photographic exhibition which toured at each of the partner museums.,In year two, students from 50 schools across the country became science journalists, investigating and reporting on climate change stories affecting their communities. The result was a fascinating range of stories covering everything from community recycling initiatives to the use of sheep poo as a future energy source. The students’ stories were published in ATMOS – a special magazine for the project.,In the third and final year of the programme, students from 60 schools were set the challenge of organising and running a mass-participation event in their school or community to raise awareness of climate change.,Students were asked to submit proposals and bid for funding from the Science Museum. They were encouraged to think creatively and run unusual and exciting events that people might not ordinarily associate with science. The events included an endangered animal football match, recycled fashion shows, flash mobs and a cycle-powered cinema. Photographs from the events were displayed at a celebration party to mark the end of the project.,We are delighted with the results of the project. In addition to raising awareness of climate change, teachers have reported many additional benefits including increased confidence among the students, a greater interest in science and improved literacy."

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/a-hundred-years-of-the-quantum-atom/,Alice Lighton,A Hundred Years Of The Quantum Atom,,Exhibitions and Galleries,"collider,einstein,physics","A few years ago, a friend asked a question that took me somewhat by surprise. “Alice,” he said, “is quantum physics right, or is it just a theory?”,At the time I was in the midst of a physics degree, so my initial response was “I hope so!”
Quantum physics
matches up to experiment extraordinarily well – it is often called the most accurate theory ever. But the question, and subsequent conversation, made me realise how little many people know about the subject, despite its profound impact on modern life and the way we think about the universe.,This year is the centenary of the publication of one of the theories that laid the foundation for our understanding of matter in terms of quanta – packets of energy. According to quantum mechanics, light is not a wave, but lump of energy called photons. Max Planck came up with the idea at the end of the 19th Century, though he considered his light ‘quanta’ a useful model, rather than reality.,One hundred years ago, in 1913, the young Danish researcher
Niels Bohr
sent a paper to the Philosophical Magazine in London that used these quanta to solve a serious problem with theories about the atom. At the time, scientists thought the atom was like a solar systems; electrons orbit a nucleus of protons and neutrons. But anything that moves in a circle gradually slowly radiates energy, and so moves closer to the centre of orbit. Eventually, electrons should fall into the nucleus of the atom.,But they blatantly don’t, otherwise everything in the Universe would collapse, and we wouldn’t exist. Bohr proposed that electrons could only sit in discrete orbits or distances from the nucleus – and therefore when electrons change orbit transitions between orbits emit only emit energy in discrete packets (quanta), not gradually. The electrons therefore stay put in their orbits, and don’t fall into the nucleus of the atom.,Bohr was the first to show that packets of energy could successfully explain and predict the behaviour of atoms, the stuff that makes up you and me. His results were only approximately correct, but a big improvement of previous theories.,Generations of scientists have built on Bohr’s insight to understand and create the modern world. When my friend asked whether quantum physics worked, I pointed at his laptop. Computers, nanotechnology, and the
Large Hadron Collider
owe their existence to the physics that began with Bohr’s generation.,Bohr’s original papers are clear and comprehensible, a beautiful read for physicists. The mathematics involves nothing more difficult than multiplication and division, yet the philosophical implications are immense. Max Planck never fully accepted quantum physics; neither did Albert Einstein, despite winning a Nobel Prize for his work on the subject.,Bohr also won a Nobel Prize for his quantum theory, but his work did not stop. He founded the Niels Bohr Institute, a centre of theoretical physics in Copenhagen, worked on the Manhattan Project developing the atomic bomb, and continued to make contributions to quantum mechanics.,And he has a lovely link to the
exhibition
I’m currently working on, about the Large Hadron Collider. Bohr was influential in the founding of CERN, the Geneva laboratory that is home to the LHC. If he had his way, the LHC would be in Denmark, but other scientists objected – Northern Europe was too cloudy, and had too few ski resorts, for Italian tastes.,Alice Lighton was a content developer for the

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/a-great-exhibition/,Will Stanley,A Great Exhibition,,At the Museum,public history,"Harriet Lamb, Senior Individual Giving Executive in our Development team, writes about the history of the 1851 Great Exhibition.,Early May marks the anniversary of the opening of the Great Exhibition of 1851 (and therefore the origins of both the
Science Museum
and
Victoria & Albert Museum
). 100,000 objects from art to machinery, from all over the world were on display in an enormous purpose built glass structure –  so big that it arched over two of the trees in Hyde Park. Nothing like it had ever been seen before.,In five and a half months, over six million people visited the exhibition from across the nation to satisfy their interest in the latest innovations and technological and manufacturing marvels of the 1850s.,There was initial concern about the cost of the Great Exhibition and building its giant glass structure, but to everyone’s surprise the exhibition made a profit of £168,000. That’s over £16m in today’s money! This money was put to good use, and following on from the phenomenal success of the Great Exhibition part of the profit was used to set up the South Kensington Museum (pictured below).,This museum housed art and science objects in new buildings on a road named after the success of 1851 – Exhibition Road. The collections grew so large that by 1893 both the science and arts collections had their own directors, with the Science Museum officially opening in 1909.,It’s amazing to think that an exhibition visited by millions of people more than a century and a half ago is part of the reason the museum is here today. Last year, our 3 million visitors generously donated almost £1m to help us continue bringing the history and future of science to life. If you’d like to support us,

Seven years of detailed design work later, the British prototype Concorde 002 had its maiden flight, with the aircraft reaching Mach 2.0 in November 1969. Concorde entered regular service in 1976, crossing the Atlantic in just 3 hours 50 minutes, before retiring in 2003 after 27 years of service.,,To this day, Concorde is regarded by many as an aviation icon and triumph of engineering.

However it was not until many years later that Turing’s ideas were realised as practical machines.,With the outbreak of the Second World War, Turing became head of a codebreaking unit at
Bletchley Park
, where he used his mathematical skills to design a series of codebreaking machines known as ‘bombes’. After the war, he moved to the National Physical Laboratory in Teddington. Here he devised one of the first practical designs for a stored-program computer, revisiting his original ideas proposed in 1936, called the Automatic Computing Engine or ‘ACE’.,Stephen Fry, explained why he was voting for Turing’s Universal Machine via

These culminated in the invention of his process for the bulk production of steel in 1856. This development was to prove massively significant in the extension of the railways and in large construction.,Bessemer, born 200 years ago this month, sought the key process that would allow him to live in the lap of luxury.  His father, Anthony Bessemer, also a successful inventor, encouraged his son’s interest in things mechanical and gave him the freedom to explore his own ideas from the early age of 17.,Early in his career, Henry Bessemer made a fortune from his mechanised process for making bronze powder, previously made in a laborious manual process fiercely protected in Germany, and sold at a high premium. Bessemer took great steps to maintain secrecy, including employing his three brothers-in-law to oversee manufacturing.,Later, Bessemer applied himself assiduously to a method for producing good quality malleable iron in quantity, and eventually high quality steel. On 24 August 1856 he presented his method to the
British Association for the Advancement of Science
in a paper entitled “The Manufacture of Iron without fuel”.  Later he commented that he should have waited until the process was reliable. He had to overcome early problems with poor quality steel due to high quantities of phosphorus in the iron ore used – an issue later resolved by
Sidney Thomas Gilchrist
. Robert Mushet also offered improvements to the process by his numerous experiments to control the amount of carbon in iron ore. Although Bessemer rejected his claims, he agreed to pay Mushet an annual pension of £300 a year for an undisclosed reason – perhaps to avoid troublesome litigation.,Despite the Bessemer process rapidly gaining international recognition, notably in France, Belgium and North America, Bessemer had a tougher time gaining in acceptance in Britain, in particular with the War Office and the Admiralty.,Never one to let a perceived injustice or lack of recognition go without a fight, in 1878 Bessemer wrote to the
Times
and to the entire cabinet, including the Prime Minster, Lord Beaconsfield, about his important role, in 1833, of inventing a way of stamping state documents that could not be open to fraud. His contribution was finally recognised with a knighthood conferred by Queen Victoria in 1879.,As to his invention of the Bessemer process for bulk production of steel – it seems inevitable, understanding his character of steely determination combined with hard work, wide experience and enormous intellect, that he would be able to look at an area outside his direct area of expertise, approach it with an open mind, not be hidebound by received practice, and finally find a satisfactory solution which was to have a worldwide impact

The truth is that there was a craze just as big a hundred years earlier and we have a pair of Victorian skates in our
Making the Modern World gallery
as evidence.,By 1880, roller skates of some kind had already been around for over 150 years.  The first prototypes of the roller skate are said to have been created by an anonymous Dutchman in the early 1700s, who as a fan of winter skiing wanted to extend his hobby into the summer months.  He created his ‘skeelers’ by attaching wooden spools to strips of wood and then nailing them to his shoes. The first recorded use of roller skates in Britain was not until 1743 when they were used as part of a London stage show.,One of the most famous early appearances of roller skates occurred in 1760 when inventor
Joseph Merlin
rolled into a masquerade party playing a violin.  Although his entrance was undoubtedly dramatic, it wasn’t a complete success as he only managed to stop by crashing into a huge mirror, breaking not only the mirror, but his violin and several of his bones too.,Over the next century, several different designs for roller skates were created and tested.  Many were heavy and difficult to control and it was not until 1863 that the quad skate we know today was designed by
James Leonard Plimpton
in New York.  The ease with which the new skates allowed users to manoeuvre them made them an instant success and Plimpton opened New York’s first skating rink in his furniture store before expanding to a bigger venue like the one in the picture below.,By the end of the 1800s, skates like the ones in our gallery, were being mass produced, which meant they were cheaper and more readily available.  Roller skating became a popular leisure activity and regular skating endurance competitions were held. London businessmen could even be seen
skating to work
! The sport’s popularity continued to grow into the 20
th
century where its success as a mainstream pastime is demonstrated in early films such as Charlie Chaplin’s
The Rink
.  Today, with new skate designs like the Land Roller and sports such as
roller derby
gaining large followings, it is clear that the popularity of the roller skate continues.,Do you think your favourite hobbies will stand the test of time?,Becky Honeycombe is a member of our Learning Support Team."

Stewart talked about

middle finger of Galileo’s right hand
has been on display at Florence’s history of science museum for many years. The museum’s recently been refurbished and (in what’s possibly a cunning marketing tool to entice visitors from the
Uffizi
around the corner) renamed the
Museo Galileo
. A gallery which contains the only surviving instruments made by Galileo himself has the finger in pride of place – and also another finger, thumb and tooth that were
recently found
.,The display stands, made in the 18th and 19th centuries, reinforce the idea of saintly
reliquaries
. It’s questionable whether these remains can tell us much about Galileo and his work – certainly less than studying the instruments he made, or his books and papers in the
Museo’s archives
. But during my visit they were by far the most popular objects in the gallery.,There’s an enduring fascination with the relics of ‘Great Men’.,Several apple trees around the country are claimed to be descended from Newton’s
inspiration for the laws of gravitation
, despite the story being almost certainly apocryphal: he only related the tale of watching an apple drop a few years before his death (possibly with a view to furthering his posthumous fame) and the story only gained wider currency centuries later.,It’s now unstoppable – a fragment of ‘that tree’ has even been taken into space. But if you prefer something a bit closer to the man himself, a number of
Newton’s death masks
survive.,Almost anything associated with Einstein is highly collectible – his brain, removed during autopsy, had its own adventure, including a road trip across the US in the boot of a rental car. You can read more about the strange story of Einstein’s brain on our

replied that, as a black person growing up in South California, being an astronaut or a pilot (he also served as a naval aviator) simply wasn’t an option and urged all of the young people in the audience to dream big, work hard and not fear failure. “You can do anything you want,” he said.,After taking questions from this enthusiastic audience for an hour, Bolden was thanked by Science Museum Director, Ian Blatchford, who presented the NASA leader with a book about the museum’s forthcoming blockbuster exhibition,
Cosmonauts: Birth of the Space Age
.,Bolden then moved on to
Engineer Your Future
, the museum’s interactive exhibition for young people thinking about their futures, which had been transformed into a Sky News studio for the day. There, the eight-strong panel of Hotseat – a collaboration between Sky News and
First News
that enables young people to interview notable public figures – put Bolden on the spot with a series of searching questions.,Bolden rejected the suggestion that NASA was in danger of falling behind other countries in the fields of technology, space exploration and earth science. “Nasa is continuing to lead the world” he said, pointing to its partnerships with 120 countries around the world, among them the
UK Space Agency
. He also insisted that space didn’t need to be a point of conflict between nations, “as long as we continue to use models like the International Space Station to show that disparate nations who may not agree on everything can in fact work cooperatively in space….I think if there’s anything that deserves a Nobel peace prize, it’s the International Space Station.”,As the father of one of the children in the audience for the NASA Adminstrator’s visit to the museum, I can attest to his inspirational impact on young and old. “That astronaut is awesome,” she told me, the highest compliment from an eight-year-old. His appearance followed a similarly
stirring visit
to the museum by NASA’s Chief Scientist, Dr Ellen Stofan. We look forward to NASA’s next trip to the U.K."

announced
for engineering’s answer to the Oscars: the Royal Academy of Engineering MacRobert Award. Here, the Chair of Judges and leading nuclear engineer, Dame Sue Ion DBE FREng, describes the three finalists for 2015 and the importance of engineering innovation in society.,Three British companies are in the running for the UK’s most prestigious and longest-running engineering prize, the
MacRobert Award
:,The MacRobert Award recognises technologies that show how outstanding engineering achievement provides value to the economy and society. Many previous winning technologies are now ubiquitous in modern medicine, transport and technology. The very first award in 1969 went to the Rolls-Royce Pegasus engine, used in the iconic Harrier jets, and in 1972 the judges recognised the extraordinary potential of the first CT scanner – seven years before its inventor Sir Godfrey Hounsfield received the Nobel Prize.,Despite operating in very different sectors, all of this year’s MacRobert Award finalists demonstrate the application of engineering innovation to tackle social and technological challenges.,The finalists are great examples of home-grown innovations that have achieved commercial success in the UK and abroad. It is hardly surprising that
recent statistics
show that the UK is first in the world for engineering productivity, and that engineering-related products make up almost half of our total exports.,Yet the continued success of the UK’s engineering industry could be under threat in the future if we cannot overcome the huge challenge of securing future talent. Engineering still suffers from old, stereotyped perceptions, which can be off-putting to many young people when considering their career choice. This means that we’re facing a shortfall of people with the skills to use technology to overcome some of the world’s biggest challenges.,We must also attract more women into engineering – only 7% of UK professional engineers are female. I have been lucky enough to have a really rewarding and enjoyable career in engineering and I am delighted that government is taking this issue seriously. The
Your Life
campaign,
launched at the Science Museum
a year ago, aims to increase the number of students – especially women –  studying science, technology, engineering and mathematics by 50% within three years.,As this year’s MacRobert Award finalists demonstrate, engineering is a humanitarian as well as a technical endeavour, with the potential to transform every aspect of life. Anyone who is passionate about changing the world for the better should look seriously at a career in engineering.,If you’d like to know more about what you can do with engineering, visit the

Autumn Lecture
on Tuesday 3 November in which he will use the technical wizardry used to tip the balance of military capability in favour of the Allies during World War 2 to illustrate the approach required to deal with the
impact of greenhouse gas emissions
, which have warmed the atmosphere and oceans, diminished the amounts of snow and ice, and raised sea levels.,Necessity fuelled many technological developments during the 1939-45 period that decisively influenced the course of the Second World War, including cracking the Enigma machine cyphers, developing radar and the jet engine, many of which are celebrated in the Science Museum exhibition, Churchill’s Scientists.,The exhibition, which opened to the public on the eve of the
50th anniversary
of Sir Winston Churchill’s death,  celebrates a crucial, but often overlooked element of Churchill’s life and legacy – his relationship with science and the remarkable breakthroughs that he championed during his time as Prime Minister, thanks to the efforts of ‘boffins’ such as Robert Watson-Watt, inventor of radar, and Bernard Lovell who created the world’s largest radio telescope.,However, of all the wartime ingenuity it is the sheer scope of Barnes Wallis’s lateral thinking in developing the
bouncing bomb
used in the famous
Dambusters raid
that fascinates Dr Hunt and epitomises the approach he thinks is now required from modern engineers in responding to climate change. “We need that mentality again now if we are to move towards a low carbon energy system and provide clean water and food for the whole population.”,Dr Hunt will use excerpts from his Channel 4 documentaries to illustrate his talk, including Dambusters: building the bouncing bomb.,Andrew Nahum, Keeper Emeritus, noted: ‘The extraordinary breakthroughs of WW2 were made by scientists and technologists like Barnes Wallis working at the very limit of established knowledge. They achieved powerful results so fast because they all knew the urgency of the challenge they faced. [As Sir Bernard Lovell reflected “the question during the war was … can you do it and how soon can we have it?“]’,Even before the war begin, the UK Government had identified the three German dams as potential targets, but had no weapons suitable for an attack. Wallis’ idea was simple in principle but very tricky to execute: bounce a four tonne rotating bomb, known as the Spherical Surface Torpedo, across 400m of water until it hits the dam, sinks and explodes.,Bouncing bombs
allowed Wallis to avoid the torpedo nets protecting the dam but it took extraordinary ingenuity. The Lancaster bombers needed to approach the dams flying only 20m above the water while traveling at 230mph then the bombs released at 389 metres from the dam – calculated by triangulating with the dam’s towers. Wallis calculated that backspin would stabilise the bombs in ‘flight’, help the bomb to bounce then stay at the face of the dam as it sank.,Shortly before he died, Wallis donated the bulk of his papers to the Science Museum, including photographs, correspondence, design notes and reports (you can read more about this

Ada Lovelace Day
, an international celebration of the achievements of women in science, technology, engineering and maths.,When
Ada Lovelace
had her portrait painted in 1835, she joked that her jaw appeared so large that the word ‘Mathematics’ could be written upon it. Mathematics and science were Lovelace’s passions and were often at the forefront of her thoughts. She spent much of her time studying mathematics, visiting the latest scientific spectacles, and socialising with the greatest scientific minds of her day.,Lovelace’s mother, Lady Byron, introduced the teenage Lovelace to the engineer
Charles Babbage
. Babbage showed Lovelace and Lady Byron a part of his first planned calculating machine, the
Difference Engine
. Lovelace was inspired and called it the ‘gem of all mechanism.’,She began to turn her attention to the mathematics underpinning the Difference Engine and Babbage’s more complicated machine, the
Analytical Engine
. Her ideas about the possibilities of the Analytical Engine are what make her famous today.,You can see both a portion of the Difference Engine that Ada herself saw, and a section of the Analytical Engine, in our
Ada Lovelace exhibition
which runs until the end of March 2016.,Ada documented her scientific interests and her work in part through her numerous letters to relatives and scientific friends. Aged 17, and becoming increasingly involved in scientific society, she urged her mother to ‘Pray find out all you can for me, about everything curious, mysterious, marvellous, electrical, etc., etc.’,The exhibition shows a selection of Lovelace’s original letters and includes a digital screen which examines Lovelace’s correspondence with Charles Babbage when she began work on a series of ‘Notes’ outlining the potential of Babbage’s Analytical Engine.,Lovelace’s resulting article on the Analytical Engine included the first published algorithm for the machine. As well as displaying this, the exhibition shows that Babbage had already sketched out similar algorithms for the machine in his notebooks.,Unlike Babbage, who was interested in number crunching, Lovelace made an incredible leap of imagination, seeing the Analytical Engine as a General Purpose machine. She realised that the machine could manipulate not just numbers, but that numbers could represent abstract items such as symbols and musical notes.,It is this work that makes her a visionary of the computer age.,…,Lovelace’s life and work was focus of a series of events held at the museum in October 2015.,We wanted to reflect the tensions and synergy between the arts and the sciences and invited contemporary figures from across all disciplines to come and present their thoughts on science, computing, the arts, and Lovelace’s legacy. Across three Friday evenings (and over a glass of wine) our intrepid visitors wrote stories, composed music, and imitated slime mould to explore how Ada Lovelace’s legacy can still be felt today.,Our October Lates was also dedicated to Ada Lovelace and computing. Among the many events taking place that evening, Sydney Padua came to talk about her best-selling graphic novel, “The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage”, and signed a copy for our very own Ada Lovelace drama character.,Three contemporary female digital artists came to show their work. In a fitting display of the harmony of computing and the arts, one of our presenters proposed to his girlfriend by writing “Will you marry me” in binary at the end of his show.,What is striking is how far ahead of her time Lovelace was in imagining computers as they are used today. Far from dry number crunching, computer programming is used in a range of artistic processes from weaving interactive stories and games to turning notes into “elaborate and scientific pieces of music”.,Today, 200 years after her birth, we can be sure that Lovelace’s legacy is alive and well.,‘Supposing, for instance, that the fundamental relations of pitched sounds in the science of harmony and of musical composition were susceptible of such expression and adaptations, the engine might compose elaborate and scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent.’,Ada Lovelace, ‘Notes upon L. F. Menabrea’s “Sketch of the Analytical Engine Invented by Charles Babbage”’,The Evening Exchange events series was supported by the Biogen Foundation, with October Lates supported by King Games.,Mary Cavanagh is an Assistant Content Developer at the Science Museum."

Roger Highfield explains more. ,"Collections and Objects,Science in the news","antibiotics,medicine","As Oxford University’s Dunn School gears up to celebrate its key role in the history of penicillin, Roger Highfield, Director of External Affairs at the Science Museum Group and member of the Longitude Committee, discusses the breakthrough and the spectre of a post-antibiotic era.,Walk through the ground floor of the Science Museum and you will pass by a
little brass box
which contains mould donated by Sir Alexander Fleming to a medical friend in 1935 after they had attended a lecture about a new antibacterial medicine: Fleming told his friend that he had something much better.,Many know that the greatest therapeutic revolution of the 20
th
century was launched by the contents of this box, which in 1928 Fleming had discovered when he returned from holiday to find mould in one of his Petri dishes where it had prevented the growth of surrounding bacteria.,But, as the billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates pointed out during
a visit to the Science Museum
to
spur more Government investment in basic research
, it took additional work in Oxford for the revolution to truly begin.,Penicillin was eventually isolated there in 1939 where it was administered for the first time in 1941 (the museum has some
early samples
), marking the rise of the antibiotic era and a precipitous fall in the toll of bacterial infections on the vulnerable: just a decade earlier, infant mortality – deaths of children before their first birthday – stood at around one in 20.,To mark the 75th anniversary of the first therapeutic dose of penicillin, the
Sir William Dunn School of Pathology
at Oxford University has organised a lecture by Jeremy Farrar, head of the Wellcome Trust, to around 300 eminent medical research scientists, friends and supporters of the Dunn School, and staff in the Weston Library – the newly renovated Bodleian building.,Head of Department, Prof Matthew Freeman said: “the administration of penicillin in man marked the birth of the antibiotic era and, unsurprisingly, was recently voted as the greatest medical breakthrough of the 20th century.”,The first dose was to Albert Alexander in 1941, a policeman in the Radcliffe Infirmary on Woodstock Road. Though this was a cause for celebration, Freeman pointed out that ‘sadly Albert Alexander died because they did not have enough penicillin for a complete course.’,Although Fleming first discovered penicillin in 1928 at St Mary’s hospital, London, he did not recognise its significance as a treatment for systemic infection and believed its instability and the challenges around purification made it unsuitable for development into a drug.,Driven by the need to address the toll of infection related deaths in World War II it was Howard Florey and Ernst Chain at the Dunn School who did recognise its full potential, and set about developing penicillin into a viable medicine.,The anniversary event is part of the Dunn School’s annual Norman Heatley lecture series, named after Florey’s associate.,Heatley is known as “the forgotten man of penicillin” but was in many people’s estimation pivotal to the work at the Dunn School, not least by fashioning a purification system out of a bookcase in the face of wartime shortages.,Other key players include another Nobelist,
Dorothy Hodgkin
, who solved the molecular structure of penicillin giving the opportunity for the development of variants of penicillin to help deal with resistance.,An exhibition about the history of penicillin,
Back from the Dead
, will be unveiled at Oxford’s Museum of the History of Science from 4 November. Among the events will be a lecture by the Science Museum’s Prof Robert Bud on 22 November, entitled Penicillin: Triumph and Tragedy, after his
book
of the same name.,The drug resulted in a Nobel Prize in 1945 for Florey, Chain and Fleming, who made the prescient remark in his acceptance speech that it is “
not difficult to make microbes resistant to penicillin
.”,Today we are more dependent on antibiotics than ever before, from organ donations to hip transplants, but our antibiotic arsenal is becoming increasingly ineffective with the evolution of resistant microbes, or ‘superbugs’.,Drug-resistant infections could kill an extra 10 million people across the world every year by 2050 if they are not tackled, warned the Review on Antimicrobial Resistance, published in December 2014, and Chief Medical Officer Prof Dame Sally Davies talked of a “catastrophic threat” earlier this year at
an event held in the Science Museum
. The £10 million
Longitude Prize
aims to spur the creation of a cheap, accurate, rapid, and easy-to-use test for bacterial infections that will allow doctors and nurses to better target their treatments.,The Museum has also had
displays about resistance
, advised Nesta, the UK’s innovation foundation, on a computer
game to highlight the issue of resistance
and will return to the subject as part of the £24 million
Medicine Galleries
, due to be completed in 2019.,Prof Matthew Freeman remarked that it was ‘sad and ironic that our celebration coincides with the announcement by the UN that the antibiotic era might soon be over.”"

Senior Content Developer Pippa Hough introduces us to some of the robots that will be visiting the Museum.,My favourite part of our fabulous, new Robots exhibition is seeing some of the world’s most cutting-edge robots working on gallery. Day in, day out these masterpieces of engineering chat to the public, learn to pick up and move novel objects, or demonstrate their immense dexterity and precision. And they will continue to perform these complex tasks, almost, perfectly as they tour all over the world in the next few years.,But perfection isn’t what engineers want from their robots in the lab. They push them until they fail, then learn from the failure and improve the robot, or its programming. That’s exactly what you’ll see roboticists do this Easter in Robots Revealed. Over a series of drop-in events you can meet some of the most advanced robots from UK robotics labs and watch as they are pushed to their limits on gallery.,The Bold Hearts
robot football team from the University of Hertfordshire are being put through their paces for the international RoboCup. Every year the rules change, the ball switches colour, or the goal width changes to push the engineers to make their robot teams ever more complex so they can cope with an increasingly difficult playing environment. This year’s big change is thicker AstroTurf. It’s a tough challenge, but robots will never be able to be a part of our lives unless they can negotiate our incredibly complex world. And there’s nothing like competition to inspire creative problem solving in engineers.,The team from the University of York is bringing down their swarm robots. You can test the robot’s limits by putting obstacles in front of them and seeing how they react. Individually the robots are very limited and quickly get stuck, but when they work together in swarms they can accomplish much more complex tasks.,Just being on gallery interacting with the public can be too much for some of the robots. A couple of weeks ago the University of Sheffield’s NAO robot spent the morning engaging visitors in conversation. Unfortunately all that activity caused it to overheat in the afternoon. The engineers tried all sorts of thing to cool it down, a brief spell in our office fridge being the most inventive.,Researchers are teaching robots to learn through trial and error too. Robot DE NIRO from Imperial College can solve a buzzwire game in just a couple of minutes. Each time it hits the wire it develops a better understanding of the shape of the wire and quickly wins the game.,By pushing robots to their limits researchers slowly and find out problems they need to solve to incrementally improve performance. Robots Revealed is your chance to meet engineers and their robots balancing on, and sometimes falling off, the cutting edge of robotics research.,The Robots Revealed events will be taking place on Level 1 next to the Robots Café between 11.00-13.00 and 14.00-16.00 on the following days:,Robots Revealed is supported by the Royal Academy of Engineering

. One of the themes explored in
Imagine
, the final section of the exhibition, is robots that care for us.,The idea of a robot caring for us isn’t something that appeals to everyone, but how about an animal that provides comfort and reassurance? The basic principals of Animal Assisted Therapy are that spending time with an animal can improve your social and emotional wellbeing. This therapeutic technique has been around for a long time and scientific research has shown how it can improve the lives of dementia and Alzheimer sufferers.,Spending time with a live animal isn’t always possible, however, which is why the
PARO therapeutic robot
was born, or should I say created, by AIST a Japanese automation company. PARO has been modelled as a white baby harp seal and has sensors to react like a real animal. This friendly robot has been used in medical centres throughout Japan and Europe to provide a catalyst for interaction between patients and caregivers.,The basic principles of the Companion pets are similar, to provide comfort and companionship to older people in care homes, however I’m inclined to agree with the box –they’re suitable from 5 to 105!,You can see the companion pets along with over 100 other Robots in the

Forces of Nature
, in which he will take viewers on a grand tour of planet Earth to explain what lies behind its startling beauty. Roger Highfield describes a Royal Society event to celebrate his latest foray into popular science.,If you need yet more evidence that a series by the BBC’s best-known science presenter is a national event, you would have found it a few days ago in the Royal Society. There President and Nobelist
Venki Ramakrishnan
introduced Brian Cox, who talked about his new foray into popular science with Tony Hall, Director General of the BBC.,Since he presented Horizon around a decade ago, and provided science advice for the movie
Sunshine
, the Manchester University professor with an Oldham twang has pulled off the remarkable feat of becoming a household name, Fellow of the Royal Society and professor of
public engagement
, who is also a passionate advocate for investment in science.,Sitting before him in world’s oldest academy of science were the Minister for Universities and Science, Jo Johnson, Nobel prize winner Sir Tim Hunt and other eminent scientists, schoolchildren and many representatives from the cultural sector: in a recent speech, Tony Hall declared how he wants the BBC to work more closely with leading national institutions, from the Wellcome Trust to the Science Museum, in a project called the
New Age of Wonder
.,Cox is a familiar sight in the Science Museum: he features in our
Collider exhibition
about the search for the Higgs particle, which has now been seen by more than half a million people worldwide, staged the puppet show
Quest for Wonder
in the Museum, recorded
Infinite Monkey Cage
in our IMAX theatre, helped us to celebrate the
launch of Tim Peake
, interviewed
Buzz Aldrin
and, most recently,
launched a competition
for schools for its new interactive gallery,
Wonderlab: The Statoil Gallery
.,Over the past three years Cox has been working on
Forces of Nature
, which begins with the first of four programmes on July 4. Hall declares the series to be ‘as beautiful and wonderful and difficult to understand as things should be’ and is in the spirit of the great Reithian tradition of creating programmes that inform, educate and entertain. ‘Great programmes do all of those things, all at that same time – this is exactly what this remarkable series by Brian does.’,For the series, Cox drew on many inspirations. One was Carl Sagan’s Cosmos, which he describes as the ‘best science documentary ever made’ because it was as polemical as it was factual. When it comes to Force of Nature, there were two more ingredients. The BBC team led by Andrew Cohen, Head of Science, sent film crews to capture spectacular events that illustrated big ideas, such as how geochemistry evolves into living biochemistry. In this way, Cox was given the ‘freedom to make a beautiful series.’,The programme makers were looking for ‘powerful standalone stories,’ said Cox. That meant, for example, recording the
extraordinary challenge
facing Nepalese villagers who climb precipitous cliffs on rope ladders in search of honey. ‘They are immune to bee stings,’ said Cox. ‘There was one scene of a guy pulling a bee off his eye – very good television.’,Then most important of all, he looked for a narrative to make these powerful images crystallize into a sparkling intellectual whole. He found his muse in  “On the Six-Cornered Snowflake,” written by Johannes Kepler, 1571-1630, who is best known for his laws of planetary motion.,Kepler describes how in 1610 he walked across a bridge in Prague when a snowflake settled on his jacket. ‘He started asking questions,’ recounted Cox. ‘Why are they six sided? What does that tell me? Why are they all different? What does that tell me?’ And, like his contemporary peers, Kepler ‘gets excited’ by the quest for answers. ‘You get an insight into the genius of this man,’ said Cox.,Kepler speculated that the six-fold structure of each snowflake provided a deeper insight into nature and was something to do with water. Today, we know that all of its strange properties can be understood in terms of water’s molecular make-up.,In 1784, the English chemist Henry Cavendish (1731-1810) described its chemical composition, a combination of hydrogen and oxygen, marking the first step towards cracking its molecular structure. Each molecule consists of one oxygen atom and two relatively tiny hydrogen atoms, arranged in a V shape.  At atmospheric pressure and temperatures below freezing, the molecules link up in networks whose fundamental building blocks are six-membered rings of hexagonal symmetry. This symmetry is preserved in snowflakes.,Simple questions about the patterns, structures and shapes of nature, from pomegranate seeds to spherical planets and the
hexagonal shape of honeycombs
, can help reveal the deeper laws of nature, explained Cox, referring to Plato’s allegory of the cave. We can only ‘see the shadows of the beautiful platonic reality outside the cave.’,Cox hates to compromise so wanted to ensure that the stunning footage fits the narrative so, for example, the six fold symmetry of snowflakes leads to the honeycomb conjecture, which was only proved in 1999. He added that the way bees construct a honeycomb is still a matter of debate among biologists: do bees build a hexagonal structure or cylindrical structures which form hexagons to pack together most efficiently?,As another example, the programme illustrates gravity with children who participate in a remarkable festival in Spain in which ‘castellers’ – human tower builders – from across Catalonia gather before the town hall at Vilafranca. There they build living towers before a crowd of 10,000 people in a daredevil event which, said Hall, ‘makes Morris dancing look tame.’,Children as young as five, wearing helmets, clamber to the summit of these living towers. ‘These children are going into battle with gravity,’ explained Cox. They do it by harnessing geometry, arranging their team to buttress towers consisting of up to ten tiers of people.,Because gravity works equally in all directions, Cox continued, the Earth ended up being a sphere. And that led Cox on to discuss what is known as the ‘potato radius’, referring to how, below this size, there is not enough gravity to smooth misshapen cosmic objects, such as icy moons and rocky asteroids. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that a lumpy fate befalls any heavenly object smaller than around 200km across.,Before Forces of Nature, Cox had only worked for BBC Two and Four, where he had enjoyed great creative freedom. He admitted to being apprehensive about having to make compromises to chase a bigger BBC One audience but had been reassured by Charlotte Moore, Controller of BBC One; the he could stick to his tried and tested creative formula.,That meant using dramatic TV to give the audience ‘permission to view integral calculus’. The hope is that he can in this way bring a broader audience to science. (‘Thank heavens for iPlayer,’ added Moore, who explained that to understand big answers to big questions, such as summing up the history of the atom in an acorn, a second viewing is sometimes necessary.),In his conversation with Hall, Cox tackled other patterns of nature: some are temporal, such as tides. Permission for the audience to dive into the arcane details of this rhythm of nature was provided by the pororoca, a tidal wave that surges down the Amazon for hundreds of kilometres. Cox told his BBC colleagues ‘I will explain it, but you are not going to like it.’ However, the footage is so spectacular that it is able to propel the audience through an explanation devised by American theoretical physicist Richard Feynman which, said Cox, relies on ‘rotating frames of reference, centre of mass of the Earth-moon system and fictitious forces.’,Cox moved on to relativity, Albert Einstein’s greatest contribution to science, which rests on the fabric of the universe being viewed as a unified whole, consisting of spacetime, rather than as separate space and time. Seasonal visits to a wood in Oxfordshire helped Cox to illustrate an associated idea of ‘block time’ or a ‘block universe’ where space-time is seen as an unchanging four-dimensional block, as opposed to the conventional view of the world as a three-dimensional space modulated by the passage of time.,During the event, Cox was grilled by four Pimlico Academy students, members of the BBC News School Report Club. He told them that his favourite moment came during a chilly stunt to explain why water is blue. Cox found himself in a red diving suit submerging into 4 deg C crystal clear waters in
Silfra
in Iceland, a fresh water fissure between continents. At a depth of about 15m his suit turned black because all the red light had been absorbed by water molecules.,‘Water is very strange stuff. The way they vibrate and oscillate takes the red light out and that’s a beautiful illustration. So I enjoyed it because I got to dive in between the continents but it’s also a really good idea to illustrate some physics about the way that water interacts with light.’,What was most interesting aspect of making the series? It was the ever-present challenge of explaining everyday phenomena, such as the tides or growth of ice crystals, he said. Cosmological explanations often rely on ‘quite a lot of hand waving’ but, by comparison, more accessible phenomena only have one explanation which has to be correct, which ‘you have to understand’, can be complicated and where ‘the detail matters’.,As he wrestled over the past three years with the Forces of Nature, Cox said he was driven on by one simple thought.,‘The world is beautiful to look at but even more beautiful to understand.’,The first of four episodes of Forces of Nature will be broadcast on Monday 4 July, BBC One, 9pm

, a cluster of two groups of computers – 250,000 in all – capable of more than 6.8 Petaflops (ten to the power of 15 Floating Point Operations per second) run by the
Leibniz Rechenzentrum
, Leibniz Supercomputing Centre, LRZ, near Munich, Germany.,‘This is one of the biggest supercomputers in Europe – more than double the size of anything in UK – and we need this extraordinary computational power to design personalised medicines in the sort of time that a doctor would take between diagnosing a disease and then selecting an off the shelf medicine for a patient,’ explained the head of the team, Prof
Peter Coveney
of UCL’s Chemistry Department.,“We were given the whole machine at the start of a maintenance shutdown and our work took place over a 37 hour period starting at 5 p.m. UK time last Saturday 11 June and ended at 6 a.m. this morning, Monday 13 June. We think it consumed 8.6 million core hours – that is equivalent to something like a quarter of a million people beavering away on everyday personal computers for 37 hours and generated about 5 terabytes of data, that is two to the power of forty bytes.”,“I’ve likened the entire effort to preparing a battle plan and an order of battle as a general would before engagement. During the effort, some bits of the campaign unravelled, but with new jobs coming in to take their place the machine was largely occupied all the time.,We achieved all our objectives and more because the jobs in the workflow ran much faster than anticipated. Preliminary analysis indicates that the simulations will provide insight into how the two most common mutations responsible for acquired resistance to major anti-breast cancer drugs (such as Tamoxifen and Raloxifene) interfere with drug binding.”,Even by the standards of supercomputer scientists, this was a huge job (technically, it is called a workflow, meaning a cascading series of many parallel and serial computations) and so ambitious that Prof Coveney has been trying to encourage his colleagues by offering a Methuselah of Champagne as an incentive. He thinks that a number-crunching job of this type and magnitude ‘may well be unprecedented anywhere.”,The results are now being analysed. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate that scientists can work out the way that a candidate drug will act on a target in the body – a protein – and in a matter of a few hours. “Fifty drugs and candidate drugs were studied to determine how they bind with protein targets in a range of disease cases, in order to rank their potency for drug development and for drug selection in clinical decision making,” he explained.,If it works, it would mark an important advance for personalised medicine, that is medicine designed with one patient in mind so that it works efficiently, and without side effects. Indeed, “it is taking far too long and costing far too much to discover new drugs by conventional experimental means; computer-based methods are the way forward,” said Prof Coveney.,“Now that we can read the genetic makeup of a person relatively cheaply we should be able to develop and target many more drugs to specific individuals,” he explained. “Most existing drugs are not effective against large swathes of the general population. In such clinical contexts, decisions regarding matching a drug to a patient will need to be taken within hours to effectively treat individuals and that is what we are trying to achieve.”,The UCL team is not just ranking existing and future possible drugs but also generating leads for new/improved drugs. Science advances with new data but you need understanding too, and the insights into how drugs work that will arise  from the breathtaking scale of Prof Coveney’s simulations are only possible because his team is modelling the atomic details of how drug molecules actually work in the body.,Scientists have been talking about turning genetic data into personalised treatment for a couple of decades and talking about using computers to design drugs for even longer. Now, at long last, it looks like we have reached the combination of sophisticated software and hardware to be able to do this in hours rather than years and, as computers become ever more powerful, so this technique will become more useful.,This project is a product of long-standing collaboration between Professor Coveney (Director of UCL’s
Centre for Computational Science
) and the Leibniz Rechnenzentrum, where his colleague Prof Dieter Kranzlmüller is deputy director.,Much of this has been supported by European Union funding. Their work is part of a EU funded project called
ComPat
, a €3 million project to support emerging high performance computing technologies; it is also a forerunner of an EU Centre of Excellence, run by Prof Coveney, who
recently was awarded €5 million

exclusive commentary
.,Peake’s six month
Principia mission
to the
International Space Station
will see him land with crewmates Yuri Malenchenko and Tim Kopra in the steppe of Kazakhstan.,Visitors can hear our distinguished panel talk about the rigours of his re-entry and touch down just after the museum opens at 10am.,Helen Sharman, who
recently celebrated
the 25
th
anniversary of her pioneering mission to the Mir space station in the museum, knows first-hand what he is experiencing, as she recently wrote in
our blog
:,“Re-entry, at more than five times Earth’s gravity (5.5 g), was much more dramatic than the launch, where we only experienced 3.5g. As we came through the atmosphere, I could see the ball of plasma around our descent module go orange and then yellow, before the windows were eventually blacked out by soot from the spacecraft.,When the drogue chute pulled out the main parachute we jolted from side to side. I was shocked by the violence of the re-entry. After the retrorockets fired, we tumbled a few times before being left hanging inside, as the spacecraft came to a rest on its side.”,Tim Peake’s mission to the ISS began in earnest  in 2013, when Science Museum Trustee David Willetts, as the
then UK science minister
, overturned the space policy that arose from what he calls “the misconceived British belief that manned spaceflight is an expensive luxury”.,While David Willetts watched his policy change come good from the launch site in Baikonur last December, over 11,000 visitors joined us in the museum on the day to celebrate Tim Peake soar into the heavens.,Around 3,000 school children
cheered him into orbit

Helen Sharman’s Sokol (‘Falcon’) suit
with her in the museum. A similar suit will be used by Tim Peake to protect in the event of a cabin depressurization during his landing.,At the end of April, when his return to Earth was slightly delayed, Peake
told the European Space Agency
: “Although I am looking forward to being back on Earth and seeing friends and family again, each day spent living in space is a huge privilege and there is much work to do on the Station.,“This extension will keep the Station at a full crew of six for several days longer, enabling us to accomplish more scientific research. And, of course, I get to enjoy the beautiful view of planet Earth for a little while longer!”,After he lands in the steppe of Kazakhstan, Tim Peake will return to the European Astronaut Centre in Cologne, Germany, for checkups and for research into how humans adapt to living in space.,The museum has run a number of space events recently: Helen Sharman’s

Our Lives in Data
exhibition, Natasha Little of the
Royal Society of Biology
discusses the work of DNA data pioneer, Sir Alec Jeffreys.,Your DNA is unique. But how much ownership and privacy do you feel about your genetic code? Would you be happy to be on a national police database? If it could be used to predict a future illness, would you want to know the results?,Last month Professor Sir Alec Jeffreys FRS Hon FRSB, the inventor of
DNA fingerprinting
, discussed his doubts about the prospect of a national DNA database at a Royal Society of Biology event at the Science Museum.,,In 1984 Sir Alec had a ‘eureka moment’ when he discovered a method of identifying individuals using their genetic code during blue skies research at The University of Leicester, which you can find out more about in the Museum’s
Who Am I? gallery
.,Soon after, Sir Alec’s lab was asked to help the Leicestershire police in the
investigation
of two rape and murder cases. This led to the very first use of DNA evidence in a criminal case, in which it exonerated a man who had given a false confession. The guilty man was found soon after through a process of screening thousands of men who lived locally.,The latest technology now gives forensic geneticists the ability to analyse minute amounts of biological material, even after environmental exposure, and determine the sequences of several hundred fragments of DNA from a crime-scene sample in one go – revealing the person’s ethnic origin, and hair, eye and skin colour.,More than 17,000 offences are now solved each year thanks to genetic fingerprinting. It has been used to
reunite parents with children
separated by natural disasters,
free people
on death-row and
identify plane-crash victims
. Sir Alec estimates the technology has touched 50-70 million people worldwide.,So, if you’ve got nothing to hide, why would you be against your genomes, and everyone else’s going onto a compulsory national DNA database?,At the Royal Society of Biology event Sir Alec said this position was ‘naïve and very misleading’. He went on to say:,‘It would be expensive. It would also be a risk to the individual. I’ve never been convicted of a criminal offence and nor will I commit a crime. If my DNA is on the database, some glitch could happen, whereby my DNA profile might come into a police investigation. I would argue it is not neutral.’,Sir Alec also discussed the problem of being stuck with the current DNA database technology established in the 1990s. ‘If you change the DNA platform with a whizzy new technology that invalidates your database immediately; you’ve got to go back and re-test everyone on that database.’,Even if the database technology was fool proof and future proof, further problems face its use in the courtroom. Many psychologists have
suggested
that jurors are not very good at understanding the complex science and associated probabilities presented as part of expert testimony about DNA profiles. Courts will also be faced with increasingly tiny, degraded trace amounts of DNA, where innocent explanations are often plausible.,At one point the UK DNA database contained over 6 million genetic fingerprints (10% of population). This included 1.5 million entirely innocent people who had been arrested but not charged or convicted. Sir Alec pointed out that this was blatantly discriminatory ‘which you could establish certainly in terms of ethnic origin’.,In 2008 The European Court of Human Rights
ruled
that the practice of keeping DNA profiles (and fingerprints of the non-DNA kind) from arrested individuals, regardless of their guilt or innocence, was a violation of people’s ‘right to a private life’ (article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights). This led to the innocent people being removed from the database. The
Protection of Freedoms Act 2012
attempts to provide a better balance between the rights of individuals and the security of society.,Sir Alec highlighted the continued importance of DNA evidence in the fight against terrorism, for example
after the Paris attacks
. However he still has ‘serious doubts’ whether that merits the a database of an entire population, as was quickly legislated for in
Kuwait
after a bombing last year.,The United Arab Emirates also passed legislation for a mandatory database of everyone living in the country years ago. However Sir Alec pointed out that many kinds of crime, for example financial, won’t leave a DNA trail. ‘What else could you do?,’ he added. ‘You could scan the entire population for every single instance of non-paternity and identify the true father… in a Muslim society that is dynamite! I’m not suggesting they would do that – but that is a risk.’,Sir Alec also expressed horror at the fact that in some countries parents or the state are encouraging checking for congenital problems and organising marriages to minimise that risk.,On testing for genetic predispositions to diseases and the prospect of precision medicine, Sir Alec said, ‘maybe we can recommend either medication or a change in lifestyle that could ameliorate genetic risks. That may be perceived as really good news, others may see it as the NHS playing Big Brother with your genome’, adding, ‘we are all full of genetic defects – they keep you going but they will kill you in the end!’ Health insurance companies, Sir Alec said, don’t ever and should never have access to your genetic data, as it would be ‘blatant discrimination’.,So who will decide where these limits are placed? The answer will come from ‘social discussion and legislation’, said Sir Alec. ‘Science and technology often runs way ahead of ethical and social debate and certainly of political decision making. Scientists are very good at coming up with whizzy new ideas. But don’t rely on us for ethical decisions. It’s up to you.’"

Craig Venter
and
Cédric Villani
.,Co-author of one of the most
influential papers
in in modern physics, which heralded hitherto unobserved new spatial dimensions, the particle physicist discussed her latest book
Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs: The Astounding Interconnectedness of the Universe
which links dark matter, an elusive and mysterious source of gravity, to events on Earth, notably the impact that wiped out the dinosaurs that ‘made room for us to evolve.’,Prof Randall discussed her most
recent research
on how to identify the nature of dark matter and informed the black tie audience that there were ‘probably a billion dark matter particles passing through you every second.’,Encouraging us all to ‘explore a little more deeply’, Prof Randall praised the Museum as ‘really impressive’ and ‘beautiful and informative,’ adding that ‘in these crazy times, engaging in and appreciating science is so critical.’,Science is global, long-term, evidence-based and involves checks and balances, she said.,Introduced at the dinner by Sally MacDonald, Director of the Museum of Science and Industry, Prof Randall was also one of the distinguished figures who contributed to
Einstein’s Legacy
, a museum exhibit marking the centenary of his theory of gravity (the general theory of relativity).,Earlier, Director Ian Blatchford described the year’s highlights for the Science Museum which ranged from being the mustering point for
10,000 people for the March for Science
to the relaunch of
Tomorrow’s World
brand, ‘as part of the biggest public engagement campaign of any major country, with the BBC, the Royal Society, Wellcome, the Open University and the Science Museum Group.’,The joint endeavour will be reflected next month when Antenna (the contemporary science zone in the Museum’s Wellcome wing) will be rebranded Tomorrow’s World in time for a major BBC Broadcast on 15 June,
Britain’s Greatest Invention
.,The Medicine Galleries, which will open in 2019, have been supported by Wellcome, Heritage Lottery Fund and the Wolfson Foundation, and Blatchford added that two new principal funders have now joined: GSK and The Dr Mortimer and Theresa Sackler Foundation.,Also opening in 2019 is an extraordinary collaboration with The Royal Society which will celebrate the birth of the society, the oldest academy of science, and the rise of London as a scientific powerhouse. ‘The Royal Society and this museum hold probably the finest 17th and 18th century science collections in the world,’ he said.,Those projects follow two landmark galleries that opened in 2016:
Wonderlab: The Statoil Gallery
– the new interactive gallery for young audiences and families, and
Mathematics: The Winton Gallery
. ‘One leading art critic wrote that he left the gallery longing – for the first time in his life – to know more equations. Result,’ said Blatchford.,Another landmark moment was the
acquisition by the group of the Soyuz capsule used by Tim Peake
on his Principia mission to the International Space Agency, which will move from London to the relaunched National Science and Media Museum in Bradford later this year.,Blatchford listed the adventurous exhibitions programme:
Robots
, ‘the largest collection of humanoid robots ever assembled’; Our Lives in Data, on the power of big data; Wounded, the health history of the First World War;
Voyages
, an exquisite photography exhibition by Anderson and Low; Engineer Your Future explaining engineering careers to young people; and most recently Valentina Tereshkova: The First Woman in Space, celebrating the
80th birthday of Valentina Tereshkova
.,And he described the increasing international reach of the Science Museum Group, from a partnership agreement with the Museum of Tomorrow in Rio de Janeiro to a forthcoming partnership with the Science and Technology Museum in Shanghai.,The Science Museum’s primary focus for the year ahead is the UK-India Year of Culture. During a British Government mission to Delhi in November 2016, the respective
Prime Ministers Theresa May and Narendra Modi
announced that the Museum would be holding one of the landmark events of 2017: the
Illuminating India
Festival that opens in the Museum this autumn.,The Museum receives more educational visitors that any other museum in Britain, and has just recorded its highest ever attendance from such groups – 460,000. The Group Chairman, Dame Mary Archer told the dinner that the UK needs this investment in young minds more than ever before. ‘As we embark on life outside the EU as an international trading nation, it will be vital to upskill the UK’s workforce in STEM subjects.‘,In October, we marked the culmination of a highly successful year for Manchester as European City of Science at the Museum of Science and Industry, with the most successful festival of its kind, the Manchester Science Festival, run by the Museum along with the
largest STEM Ambassador programme
with a network of over 2000 STEM ambassadors.,Finally, Dame Mary presented a Fellowship of the Museum, the highest accolade that it can offer, to one of the UK’s most distinguished scientists, Sir Venki Ramakrishnan, President of the Royal Society, who won the Nobel prize for his work elucidating the workings of one of the wonders of nature,
a molecular machine called the ribosome
.,Sir Venki remembered visiting the museum in the early 90s with his son, ‘and it was fantastic,’ not least because it had an exhibition about the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, where he was about to work, which impressed his teenager. He said the Royal Society enjoyed a ‘very fruitful partnership’ with the Museum."

Marie Curie
, who won her two Nobel Prizes in the years just before and after the Science Museum’s creation in 1909. She understood both the vital power of science in industry and its beauty as a cultural force, driven by curiosity.,“We should not allow it to be believed that all scientific progress can be reduced to mechanisms, machines, gearings, even though such machinery also has its beauty,” she
explained
. “Neither do I believe that the spirit of adventure runs any risk of disappearing in our world. If I see anything vital around me, it is precisely that spirit of adventure, which seems indestructible and is akin to curiosity.”,That our museums enjoyed around
5.55 million visits
in 2015/16 is testament not only to people’s enduring fascination with the history of human ingenuity but also to the creativity of the people who work with me. In Bradford,
Light Fantastic
delivered a compelling new take on physics as part of the National Media Museum’s sharpened focus on the science of image and sound, as audience numbers soared by 11 per cent.,At the Science Museum, the critically-acclaimed
Cosmonauts: Birth of the Space Age
was the undoubted highlight of a year that saw a record 3,419,000 attendances. This included unprecedented school visits, with 390,000 young people visiting in an educational group, a new record for UK museums. A further 84,000 people attended shows or workshops at schools, festivals and science fairs as the outreach team took our mission to inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers on the road, here and abroad.,At the National Railway Museum’s
Shildon site
the audience was up by almost a third, while in York floods could not keep the crowds at bay in a year that culminated in the triumphant return of
Flying Scotsman

Manchester Science Festival

, President of the
Royal Society
, the world’s oldest learned body, remarked that these excellent audiences across the group “show that the popularity of science is increasing all the time”. He added, “it shows the public has a real appetite for knowledge and innovation, which bodes well for culture and the economy.”,I believe this sentiment is critical to understanding the true value of the Science Museum Group; a vital part of Britain’s cultural landscape and a catalyst to fire the imagination of tomorrow’s innovators when the UK faces a real science and engineering skills gap. Nearly 1.8 million under 16s and well over half a million 16- to 24-year-olds visit our sites every year, and my fervent hope is that among them will be future engineers and scientists, including more Newtons and Curies.,Curie knew only too well why we have to nurture scientific curiosity:,“When radium was discovered no one knew that it would prove useful in hospitals. The work was one of pure science. And this is a proof that scientific work must not be considered from the point of view of the direct usefulness of it. It must be done for itself, for the beauty of science, and then there is always the chance that a scientific discovery may become like the radium a benefit for humanity.”"

Lisa Randall
will echo his feat when it comes to linking an elusive and mysterious cosmic source of gravity,
dark matter
, to events on Earth, as part of a wider meditation on under-appreciated and unexpected connections between the tiniest particles of all and the greatest structures in the universe.,Randall, who was one of the distinguished figures who contributed to Einstein’s Legacy, a Museum exhibit marking the centenary of his theory of gravity (the general theory of relativity), has written
Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs: The Astounding Interconnectedness of the Universe
to connect dark matter to the celestial object that killed off the dinosaurs some 66 million years ago with a cataclysmic impact on what she calls our ‘random tiny perch here on Earth’.,We know dark matter exists by inferring that it is real, rather than directly observing it. Analyse the movements of stars in the heavens and you can work out how much matter is making them swirl round in galactic islands and how much makes galaxies cluster together – in other words, you can work out how much mass makes the universe look the way it does.,But the universe is not what it seems.,As long ago as 1933, the independent thinker and ‘oddball’
Fritz Zwicky
observed that galaxies in the gigantic Coma Cluster are moving around faster than you’d expect from the amount of visible matter, as if the tug of something invisible is holding the cluster together, explains Randall.,Even more convincing evidence came from Vera Rubin and her collaborator Kent Ford of the Carnegie Institution in Washington in the late 1970s from studying the speed of stars orbiting the
Andromeda galaxy
(and later other galaxies).,Observations such as this suggest that stars account for only about one per cent of the mass of the universe. Ghostly
neutrino particles
contribute, at most, a similar amount. Throw in gas clouds, planets and other objects, and you get another 10 per cent. That leaves about 85 per cent unaccounted for – this is dark matter.,Though unseen and unfelt ‘dark matter affects the expansion of the universe, the path of light rays passing to us from distant objects, the orbits of stars around the centres of galaxies, and many other measurable phenomena,’ she says, adding that direct detection remains a ‘holy grail’ of researchers.,Although scientists have largely assumed that dark matter only interacts with itself very weakly, if at all, Randall suggests that a fraction of dark matter also interacts through a force analogous to electromagnetism, which she dubs “dark light” (as she explains: ‘the new type of dark matter experiences a force like electromagnetism – but one that is invisible to the ordinary matter of our world.’),Only dark matter particles would experience the new force’s influence. This new kind of dark matter could form an invisible disk that overlaps with the visible disk of spiral arms in our own galaxy, the Milky Way, and Randall argues that the demise of the dinosaurs might have occurred when this dark disk interrupted the orbit of a comet on the outer fringes of the solar system, sending the icy body on a collision course with Earth.,Even though some of the most radical ideas of cosmology (for instance the ideas
of inflation and the multiverse
) challenge the never-ending dialogue between theory and experiment that lies the heart of the scientific method, Randall does set out various tests that could reveal the dark disk, not least looking for the gravitational effects of the disk on other stars in the Milky Way—or in another galaxy, for that matter.,With her enthralling book, Randall wants to show us how the pieces of the universe connect, discussing a great deal of modern physics on the way. ‘The big lesson at the most fundamental level is that the physics of elementary particles, the physics of the cosmos, and the biology of life itself all connect – not in some New-Age sense, but in remarkable ways that are well worth understanding.’,Lisa Randall, the leading cosmologist who contributed to the Museum’s Einstein’s Legacy exhibit, discussed her new book with Roger Highfield, Director of External Affairs, during a visit to

The Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest experiment, normally runs for 24 hour-a-day, seven days a week, but for four weeks in January and December, it is switched off writes Alice Lighton.",Exhibitions and Galleries,"christmas,collider,physics","Over the past three weeks, deep under the Jura Mountains on the Swiss-French border, a monster has been sleeping. Over Christmas, the
Large Hadron Collider
, the world’s largest experiment, takes a break from colliding protons together in an underground tunnel. The machine normally runs for 24 hour-a-day, seven days a week, but for four weeks in January and December, it is switched off.,There are several reasons for the extended break. The physicists, engineers and support staff who operate the machine and experiments are human. Yes, they are devoted to the search for the fundamental laws that govern the Universe, but they also like to indulge on Christmas pudding and see their families.,That explains why the LHC doesn’t run on Christmas day, but why does it shut down for three weeks?,Because it’s cold outside.,The cold doesn’t affect how the LHC works – far from it, as the machine is cooled to -271ºC. But it does affect the power supply.,One of the most intriguing facts I’ve learned over the course of working on the Science Museum’s upcoming
LHC exhibition
is that even though the LHC does an extremely specialised and power-consuming task – accelerating protons so they have the energy of a high speed train and are travelling at nearly the speed of light – the machine takes its power from the French grid. The same nuclear, coal and hydro-electricity plants that provide the energy to light the
Mona Lisa
and charge your
mobile
on holiday also power the LHC.,When it’s cold outside French electricity consumption spikes. In December, France uses about
50 percent more
electricity than it does in August, heating, cooking and lighting dark days. When all systems are go,
CERN
can use as much as
a third
of Geneva’s power, or the same as a large town. So during darkest depths of winter, when the French grid is being stretched the most, the LHC powers down.,The time off isn’t wasted. Repairs and upgrades are always needed, so engineers have been busy tweaking to ensure the LHC is in tip-top condition for its run in 2013. From next week LHC will fire protons into lead nuclei for a month. After that short run, the machine shuts for two years for a serious upgrade."

compulsive urge
that can result in real physical harm.,Hidden within our medical collections are examples of objects which have found their way into the body, ‘accidently’ or otherwise. Here we shall concentrate on the more benign examples.,There is something almost reassuring about the adaptability and robustness of the human digestive system as the spoon above caused “no pain or uneasiness” and “passed without discomfort” despite its month long gastric odyssey.  Its smooth contours probably helped.,Rather more worrying is when sharp points and edges are involved.  Fortunately, this tie pin’s disappearance was short-lived but some 94 years ago it prompted an urgent trip to London’s
Charing Cross Hospital
.,Childhood curiosity is behind several of the swallowed items in our collection.  Like the pin, the halfpenny above caused another anxious hospital visit.  On this occasion, the wannabe piggy bank – a hapless toddler – eventually needed surgery to have the coin removed.,But while most of our subjects at least seem to have been aware that something was amiss, there are exceptions.  Back in 1863, the smoker who almost swallowed this two inch section of hard clay pipe was apparently oblivious to its presence.,Finally, a favourite of mine.  It should be noted that not all of our misplaced items took the oral route.  I will spare readers gorier examples, highlighting instead this particular object which suggests that while certain behaviours have changed much over the last century, others have stayed very much the same…"

To adjust the focus the photographer had to change the distance between the lens and the glass plate by extending or collapsing the bellows. This camera design was advertised at the time as ‘the best and most compact camera ever invented.’,Originally, George Hare was a cabinet maker trained by his father. After setting up his London-based cabinet business, George switched to camera manufacturing. From 1876 until his death, Hare’s company address remained at 26 Calthorpe Street, London.,Despite his camera manufacturing business doing well his son (and apprentice) James “Jimmy” Hare (1856-1946) thought it could be doing better. Jimmy believed that his father should start making smaller hand-held cameras, which were just becoming technologically feasible. Photographic film was first patented by
George Eastman
in 1884, and made popular with his
Kodak
camera of 1888. Along with shortened exposure times and the mechanical shutter, this changed the nature of
photography
.,Photographers could leave their studios and record events instead of carefully arranged scenes. And this was exactly what Jimmy was interested in.
Jimmy
left the camera manufacturing industry to become a free-lance photographer, and later became one of the world’s leading photojournalist during five major wars, from the Spanish-American war to the First World War. So in a way the lives of George and Jimmy are part of a bigger story about the technological advancement and rising popularity of photography. How are the lives of your ancestors intertwined with the history of science, technology, engineering and medicine?"

Sir Charles Lovatt Evans

tickling

Hill’s lecture on ‘The Muscle and Its Energy’ was number 65 in a series that included lessons on Latin.  Although they may not resemble a conventional tool bag, they were the tools of the trade used by scientists at the time. For example, scientists used gramophones to record their lectures whilst teachers, students and researchers  used them to help them teach or learn about science.,By looking at objects we soon discover the tales of the people related to them. So, what can objects tell us about our ancestors? After all, objects become so much more meaningful when they are personal to us by relating to our families.  In this series of blog posts we will be exploring the lives of our ancestors by looking at a series of (tool) bags from the Science Museum’s collections.,"

dextrose
are sad reminders of the life and death hunt for 500 similar bottles in March 1972. Five patients died at the
Devonport Hospital
in Plymouth having received fluid from the same batch as these. The fluid was found to be heavily contaminated with bacteria.  A
landmark inquiry
was launched to discover what went wrong and to ensure it wouldn’t happen again.,Sterilisation is a key story in the advancement of modern medicine. It’s critical to everyday hospital practice. Largely a practical matter of engineering and systematic checks, sterilisation isn’t glamorous but it’s critical for patient safety – as the Devonport Incident illustrated.,In 1971, these two bottles were
autoclaved
at the same time. A fault on the machine resulted in only the bottles on the top two shelves being sterilised properly. Those on the lower shelf were not. There were quality control checks – but the assessed bottles were only taken from the top shelf so the failure wasn’t detected and the whole batch was issued for use.,Eleven months later the bottles from the lower shelf reached Devonport hospital. During that time, surviving bacteria multiplied in the solution and produced a toxic fluid with deadly consequences.  There are only slight differences between the bottles – the aluminium cap on the contaminated bottle was still shiny as it hadn’t been sufficiently heated to go dull like the bottle that was sterilised,What’s sad is that it often takes tragic incidents like this to identify what’s going wrong with a system, and then implement new standards and checks. The inquiry identified numerous ways safety could be improved from manufacturer to hospital – thankfully those measures are still implemented today and the lessons from this incident are still taught to hundreds of healthcare workers every year."

of Dartmouth took the earlier, and rather ineffective, steam pump by Thomas Savery, christened by him the ‘Miner’s Friend’, and expanded it up into a truly practical industrial machine that harnessed the power of the atmosphere. The first of Newcomen’s engines was erected near
Dudley Castle
in the Midlands, in 1712. Here, then, was the beginning of our mineral energy-intensive age.,As the Science Museum expanded in the early twentieth century, the central role of steam meeting our energy needs placed the engine collection centre-stage: the first things visitors still
see entering the museum
are engines by
James Watt
, and other engineers.,The thing was, the museum long had a gap in its collections: there was no Newcomen-type engine to display. Curator HW Dickinson was asked to make good the deficiency. By the end of 1914, and mindful that agents for
Henry Ford’s museum
at Detroit were also snooping around, he had surveyed all the candidate engines.,The one chosen was that from
Pentrich Colliery, Derbyshire
. It was built by Francis Thompson in 1791, and used the original working cycle pioneered by Newcomen, although the engine was physically altered (and relocated) during its working life.,Dickinson oversaw the purchase, dismantling and re-erection of the 105 tons of iron, stone and timber comprising the engine and large portions of its engine house inside the Science Museum . It remains there today, symbolising the substitution of mineral for organic energy which Britain’s industrial revolution depended upon.,,For an alternative view of the Newcomen engine why not check out the Science Museum’s

gun-punt model
that was on show in the British Small Craft exhibit at  the Science Museum, now closed to make way for a major new gallery on communications. Today, I’ve got three models from the sea boats display to show you: the cutter, gig and lifeboat.,The cutter model represents the general utility boat used by the Navy and carried on their warships at the beginning of twentieth century. The label explains that it is clincher-built (overlapping plank construction) and ‘is very much heavier, both in design and construction than a gig.’,It goes on to say that it was pulled by 12 oars, six aside with each oar equalling one man.  But if you look closely at the model you see that it actually has seven
rowlocks
down each side making 14 in total, not 12.  This model, along with the gig, was lent to the museum by a Lieutenant Colonel H Wyllie in 1934.,In comparison, the gig (as a boat type) was lightly built using the carvel building method (plank edges fused together side-by-side) creating fine lines for speed. This model represents a captain’s gig used in the Navy at the beginning of the twentieth century.  Because it was a more elegant and lightly built craft it needed fewer men to pull it along, hence the six visible metal rowlocks – three on each side.,This model of a ship’s lifeboat is shown ‘on davits of a quadrant type, patented by Mr A. Welin in 1900’ as the accompanying label explains.
Axel Welin
was a Swedish inventor and industrialist who founded his own engineering firm, the Welin Davit & Engineering Company Ltd.  The model shows his quadrant design for the davits – with the horizontal mechanism movement – which meant that a life boat like this could be lowered quickly and safely over the side of a ship in an evacuation.,I’ve one more British Small Craft story to share with you – watch out for my final post."

The fundamental advances in human industry – from building ships to building genomes, from spinning jennies to spinning quarks – have a foundation in science.”,Expanding on why he had chosen to make his follow up to last year’s MacTaggart Lecture at the Science Museum in London, Schmidt said that “Museums do more than entertain and teach, they also open peoples eyes to career opportunities. The Museum we’re in today is a great illustration… It is a place to cherish, but more importantly a place to inspire. This is a remarkable venue, and I say that as someone who has visited a lot of museums.”,“It is full of memories of so many inventions – indeed, so many British inventions…Today nearly 3 million people pass through its doors each year, two-thirds in groups with children.”,When it comes to computer literacy, he listed a range of initiatives that have emerged since his MacTaggart lecture, including a report produced by

In 1957, the space race started, with the USSR’s successful launch of Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite to orbit the earth. In 1969, the USA put humans on the Moon. In 1954 the European organisation for nuclear research,
CERN

And throughout the two decades, civil uses of nuclear energy were being developed.,These decades of post-war reconstruction, of decolonization and independence, were also when the world population began to boom. Industrial agricultural technologies, such as pesticides and nitrogen based synthetic fertilizers, started to spread outside industrialized nations, as part of what was called the

I’ve been here nearly 3 months now, and it’s true…time does fly when you’re having fun!,I can honestly say that I have spent the majority of the time smiling and laughing!
There’s a real atmosphere of FUN here and the rest of the Explainer team are great. Everyone has been a “newie” at some point and knows what it’s like, so when you’re stuck they welcome questions and are ready to help.,During our first week, induction week, the 12 of us were put through our paces doing things like presentations, going on a museum treasure hunt (honestly, it was hard work!), playing team-building games and acting out some of the “Sticky Moments” that can happen when faced with the public.,A highlight had to be watching a fellow “newie” pretending to be a very non-compliant 5 year old who was lost (you know who you are!), giving the Explainer the run-around. (This actually happened to me over the Easter holidays! A very upset 5 year old running up and down outside
The Garden
howling “Daddy, Daddy where’s my Daddy?!”. Fortunately for me, Dad was located quickly, although he was alarmingly relaxed about it all…..unlike his poor boy!).  Although every situation we looked at had us howling with laughter, there was a real sense that we were learning something really valuable.,It was impressive that over the entire week, we were tested, observed, challenged, encouraged and supported, and we felt confident that although we had a lot to learn, we wouldn’t be thrown in at the deep end. By the end of the week we felt exhausted, but armed with our red Explainer T-shirts we were ready to get stuck into the job…Bring it on!,During our first few weeks, let loose in the museum, we shadowed experienced Explainers. My very first task was to help collect and crush dry ice for the
Icy-Bodies
exhibit on Launchpad. It’s hard to believe how cold that stuff is (a chilly -78°C) but stories of past Explainers accidentally nearly getting frostbite gives you the incentive to don the geeky lab-coat and specs, along with some massive mits, and treat it with the respect it deserves!,Some of the tasks have been scarier than others. Being on
Launchpad
schools entrance dealing with the organised chaos on a busy, fully booked day is always an eye-opener. It is a real skill being able to compassionately calm the poor harassed teacher who has battled the tube system with 30 over-excited kids (give them a medal for bravery I say!), or the teacher whose coach broke down and is now an hour late with 60 kids.,Often you feel as if you need eight arms, and eyes in the back of your head, however the experienced Explainers are a model of calm (usually!) and are full of sensible advice and tips. As each day passes and you get stuck in, it gets more instinctive.,Every time I walk into the building in the morning I can’t quite believe I work in

Ebers papyrus
tells us the Ancient Egyptians had an interesting way to deal with noisy crying babies: just give them a draft of opium. This practice was still very much use in the Victorian era, when it gained notoriety for the dangers the use of children’s opiates posed to general health.,We know in this era opium was readily used as a cure for a bad cough, or aches and pains, but it is less well known that opium was also given to children, and even babies. Restless or teething babies and small infants would be given concoctions such as
Mrs. Winslow’s Soothing Syrup
, which contained
morphine
(an opium derivative). There were at least ten brands of mixtures aimed at children and infants including Atkinson’s Royal Infants’ Preservative, and Street’s Infants Quietness. The most famous preparation of children’s opiates was
Godfrey’s Cordial
, which was a mixture of opium, treacle, water and spices.,Medical Officers
during this period were convinced that opium was a major cause of infantile death, with the use of opium becoming widespread amongst working class families. Opium was often described as the ‘Poor Child’s Nurse’, due to its ability to stop hungry babies from crying. Attitudes towards the administering of opium to children were often casual, with preparations such as laudanum and paregoric stating recommended doses for children and infants on the labels of bottles.,One Manchester druggist even admitted to selling between five and six gallons of “quietness” every week. That’s around 24 pints! Opium caused infant mortality through starvation rather than overdose; as one doctor stated that infants ‘kept in a state of continued narcotism will be thereby disinclined for food, and be but imperfectly nourished”. The scale of infant mortality at the time was not fully known, as coroners often recorded the cause as ‘starvation’. Lozenges or pastilles containing opium were often displayed within pharmacy shop cabinets in rows, very much like a candy shop.,This article was written by Kristin Hussey and Luke Pomeroy, Collections Information Officers."

References to poppy juice are mentioned on 7
th
century BC medical tablets from the Assyrian civilizations, and the Sumerians called the poppy the ‘plant of joy’. The Greeks used poppy preparations widely in their medicine, although most famously in the mixture called Theriac or Mithrate which was invented in the 1
st
century AD. The concoction which had up to 64 ingredients including opium, cinnamon, myrrh, honey and ‘viper’s flesh’ was used to treat poisonous snake bites among other complaints. Theriac was widely traded as far as China, and arrived in England in the 14
th
century where it was called ‘Venice Treacle’ for its sticky and sweet consistency. It became known almost immediately as a cure for the Black Death, and parents rubbed the stuff on their children to keep them safe. Much like smelling sweet spices kept in ‘pomanders’, this technique probably did not work very well against the highly infectious plague.,Opium was widely used in Englandby the 14
th
century for its ability to induce sleep. William Shakespeare famously wrote in his play
Othello:,‘Not poppy, nor mandragore,,Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world,,Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep,,Which thou ow’dst yesterday.’,Laudanum, a mixture of opium, water and alcohol, eventually became the most widely used preparation of opium, and the most abundant in the Science Museum’s collections. The term was first coined in the 16
th
century by the Italian botanist Paracelsus, who called his own pill-like laudanum preparation ‘the stone of immortality’. The drug was made famous by the English physician John Sydenham in 1660. Sydenham’s liquid laudanum, opium combined with sherry, instantly became popular as a cure-all for pain and other complaints. As Sydenham himself said of the drug, ‘Medicine would be a cripple without it…’,,,In early medicine, opium was an indispensable tool in the doctor’s and surgeon’s arsenal, used to treat insomnia, pains, diarrhoea and even cholera. In the Science Museum’s collections of medicine chests, you can find a small bottle of some opium mixture, usually laudanum, in almost every one. It is worth remembering that unlike today, most people in earlier times would probably never have seen a doctor in their life. They often had to rely on drugs like opium for pain relief instead of proper medical care. As you can imagine, pain-relief and addiction went hand-in-hand.,This article was written by Kristin Hussey and Luke Pomeroy, Collections Information Officers.,,"

Hannah Green, ‘our fixer’ then got to work as Project Manager to make sure that operationally we could deliver what we’d promised. This is no mean feat in a Museum the size of ours, things then get even more complicated when you add in a highly creative production team.,The ‘as live’ performance was on a Thursday night, but first the production had to move in, this was a very difficult logistical process given that we don’t allow any equipment to be moved through the Museum during opening hours. The first tranche of deliveries arrived on Monday night with plywood going down to protect the flooring from the heavy loads. The majority of equipment was in by 10am on the Tuesday morning, this included staging, TV cameras and trolleys, lighting, cabling, amps etc etc. Also, I shouldn’t forget, there was also a production team of 50.,,,By Wednesday morning the lighting, video, audio and two of the biggest projectors in Europe had been fine tuned and were ready for the first rehearsal.

‘The Ricciotti Ensemble of Amsterdam’
were very flexible and responded to Craig’s direction with superb results. The dancing of

On the night these spectators had a huge part to play as the ‘live TV’ audience, their involvement was integral to the end result. In the final dress rehearsal I sat at the TV mixing desk where it dawned on me that no matter how good tonight was everything had been done for one thing and one thing only, making a TV programme. Everything was timed to absolute perfection, with second by second commands directing the various cameras to focus, pan and zoom onto different sections of the orchestra, crowds and stage.,,We brought the audience in, albeit 45 minutes late, this is ‘Live TV’ after all so not everything can go to plan. Avril introduced the night and reminded people that they were being filmed and if they were sat next to anybody they shouldn’t be then perhaps they should move. Nobody moved.,The performance went with no apparent hitches with only one unplanned re-take at the end and judging by the applause throughout everybody seemed to enjoy themselves.,,I left with the audience at 21.45 but Hannah and Jon Kaddish stayed on through the night to ensure that the get out was as smooth as possible. I met them the next day along with Avril and the Assistant Producer, Sam.

.,These amazing pieces of engineering are often scrapped after their job is done. They are far too large to fit in any museum, so we have a model of the similar machines used to bore the Channel Tunnel in the 1990s.,However, at our
Large Object store at Wroughton in Wiltshire
we have one of their very much smaller ancestors, the Whitaker Tunnelling machine.,Ours was built about 1922 and used for early Channel Tunnel exploratory work.,Like modern machines it has a revolving ‘cutter head’ at the front to chew through soil or soft rock, and is gradually inched forward as the tunnel is excavated.,How it came to the Museum is a fascinating story.
Abandoned for nearly 70 years
outside the short tunnel it excavated near Dover, the machine was rescued in the 1990s, restored, and presented to us.,Yet there is a sombre side side to its history – the Whitaker Tunnelling machine was originally developed to drive tunnels under the German lines during the First World War, so that so that huge caches of explosives could be fired under them to break the stalemate on the Western Front.,The forthcoming anniversary of that destructive conflict reminds us how conflict is often a driver for technological change for good or ill."

New Year Honours List
has been announced and some will be starting off 2012 with new titles or new letters after their names. A number of scientists and medical researchers were honoured this year. Unsurprisingly the Science Museum’s medical collection has its fair share of sirs and dames as well as OBEs and Orders of Merit.,Arthur Weston made a number of artificial prostheses while imprisoned in Stalag VIIIB/344 (Lamsdorf) during the Second World War. This is just one example made from salvaged materials. Weston later became an OBE (Officer of the British Empire).,Sir James Reid (1849-1923) was personal physician to Queen Victoria. For his services he was knighted in 1895 and would also attend to the health of King Edward VII and King George V. He was also a trusted confidant and recommended that
Joseph Lister
become a
peer
.,Dr Mary Scharlieb
(1845-1930) was a pioneering female physician and awarded a knighthood in 1926 for her work in medicine and services to public causes. She served on the royal commission on venereal diseases from 1913 to 1916 and was one of the first female magistrates.,Dorothy Hodgkin
(1910-94) was awarded the prestigious and exclusive Order of Merit in 1965 to add to her 1964 Nobel Prize for “her determinations by X-ray techniques of the structures of important biochemical substances”. The Order of Merit is a group of 24 individuals of great achievement in the fields of the arts, learning, literature and science. Hodgkin was only the second woman to be part of the exclusive group – the first was
Florence Nightingale

before 30 November 2015.,“Every time I walk in the Cosmonauts exhibition I feel the same excitement as the RD-108 engine greets me to the tune of Sputnik’s radio signal. People of all kinds come to Cosmonauts, almost reflecting the variety of the items on display. Some had Yuri Gagarin’s posters in their bedrooms in the 60s, some are children in astronaut costumes. Some are retired aeronautics engineers, some are art students. Some admire the bravery of the first cosmonauts, some indulge in the secrets of the LK3 Lunar Lander.,Yet, as we stroll along the gallery listening to Russian ballads, they all have a story to tell or a question to ask. As volunteers, it is a pleasure sharing our experiences with the visitors- we learn so much from them, as they do from us! ”,– Alev,‘For me there is paradox at the heart of this exhibition. You look at the hardware and you can’t help wondering at how primitive it all looks, as if it was simply bashed together in a workshop. However, you look closer and you begin to see just how awesome and sophisticated it really is. I am captivated by the personalities and the stories, and when you match the stories with the hardware, you begin to understand what true pioneers these people were.,Each time I volunteer, I am awestruck just to be in the presence of all this hardware that paved the way for travel in space. These objects have been the subject of such monumental events that have taken place in my lifetime and here they are!”,– Paul,‘After my first shift as a Volunteer in the
Cosmonauts
Exhibition I wondered whether the experience might become tedious over six months. After my second shift I knew it wouldn’t! It seems that each visitor to the exhibition has a special personal reason for being there.,I’ve met a woman who has been planning for years to make a film encapsulating the story; someone else guided me to a talk by astronaut Chris Hadfield; Russians of a certain age have a tear in their eye as they contemplate their past. Add these personal stories to an amazing collection of artefacts and I know that this is an experience I shall never forget.’,– Stephen,‘After 15 years of teaching I decided that I wanted to try my hand at helping people to learn and make new discoveries outside of the classroom.

I’m no longer the teacher but the learner. A day in the exhibition is wasted if I haven’t discovered something new from a visitor or fellow volunteer. It’s not unusual to realise that you’ve spent 15 minutes enthralled by a visitor’s vivid and detailed story about one of the objects on display, heard half a dozen exclamations of ‘had you noticed…’ from fellow volunteers or come home with at least three new websites or books to investigate!’,– Joanne,‘Coming in to volunteer for the Cosmonauts Exhibitiion, I was excited to get a glimpse of the never-before-seen objects that marked the birth of the space age.,What I didn’t expect was collecting an arsenal of stories that are going to stay with me for years to come: seeing

Reproduction 2.0
event at the recent Manchester Science Festival was
Dr Marta Shahbazi
, a member of the research team led by
Professor Magdalena Zernicka-Goetz
at the University of Cambridge;
Dr Norah Fogarty
, a member of the research team led by
Dr Kathy Niakan
of the Francis Crick Institute in London; and
Professor Sir Doug Turnbull
, Director of the Wellcome Trust Centre for Mitochondrial Research in Newcastle-upon-Tyne.,We began the evening at the Museum of Science and Industry, Manchester, with three quick presentations, the first was at the most basic end of the research spectrum, from Dr Shahbazi, first author of a paper about a
new technique
that doubles the time that human embryos can be grown in the laboratory, in her case where Robert Edwards did the basic research which paved the way to Louise Brown and his
Nobel prize
.,This is highly significant. Embryos are implanted in the mother on day six, but it had not been possible to study this process, the ‘black box of development,’ until the Cambridge team found the right conditions.,However, their feat has also triggered intense debate because international guidelines and UK legislation forbid human embryos being grown beyond 14 days, based on the fact that only at this point in development does the embryo have a glimmer of a body axis. This is also the latest stage at which the embryo can split to form twins.,The Cambridge work promises to provide vivid new insights into the details of human development. Among them, Dr Shahbazi reflected on how human embryos appear to have an ‘intrinsic capability’ for self-organisation, at least until day 13, without the help of the mother.
Using their new methods, they could also open the black box of development, revealing processes during the all-important stage of implantation. ‘Around 30 to 70 per cent of pregnancies fail at implantation,’ she said.,Using brightly-coloured fluorescent labels, the Cambridge team can chart the details of the breath-taking feats of self-organization that lie behind the development of a single fertilized egg into that vast, sentient community of interacting and different cells that we call a human being.,Moving closer to the clinic, Dr Fogarty presented
pioneering gene editing research
performed at the Francis Crick Institute in London. She and her colleagues are using genetic surgery (genome editing, with the formal title CRISPR/Cas9) to turn off genes in human development to study molecular mechanisms of development before implantation. ‘Before we had done this study, we did not know if this technique would work in the human embryo,’ she said.,Her team at the Crick studied the development in a plastic dish of an edited human embryo, which had been donated by parents undergoing IVF, with their informed consent.,Genes are the recipes to make the body’s building blocks, proteins, and her lab focused on one particular protein, OCT4, which they revealed was at work in the embryo’s cells by using a chemical label that glowed green.,Using gene editing, they turned off OCT4 and compared the consequences with an unedited control embryo in time-lapse videos. Both embryos cleaved as they developed but when it came to the formation of a cavity, when the embryo is at the stage of implantation and called a blastocyst, the edited embryos were unstable and collapsed.,Without OCT4 the embryos were ‘messed up’, said Dr Fogarty, and did not make the right proteins in the right cell types, particularly in the 20 or so of the 200 cells in the early embryo that go on to form the baby (the rest form the placenta). The conclusion, she said, was that OCT4 is fundamental to the proper development of human blastocysts. This proof of principle experiment is a small but important step in beginning to understand what genes are absolutely required for embryo development.,The profound impact of these technologies on parents became clear when Professor Turnbull described his efforts in Newcastle over more than a decade to offer a treatment to families who are blighted by disorders in mitochondria – the cell’s power packs (around one in 5000 of the population).,His team has developed a way to have unaffected children by the creation of what are called ‘three parent babies’, with a second ‘mother’ providing normal mitochondria.
Their proposal
was radical because scientists have agonised for decades over what is called “germ-line” gene therapy – genetic changes passed down in eggs and sperm. However, what the Newcastle team proposed was not like conventional germ-line therapy, since it would only affect future generations if used to free a baby girl of the disease (mitochondria are only passed from mother to child.),After a long and exhaustive period of consultation, the Newcastle Fertility Centre was granted the first UK licence in March of this year –
in fact first of its kind anywhere
– to offer mitochondrial donation by pronuclear transfer, a way to take the parent’s DNA and combine it with mitochondria from an egg donor.,‘We probably have the best regulation anywhere in the world’, he said, referring to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act. When a child is eventually born with another woman’s mitochondria, which is likely in the next year or two, their long-term development will be monitored in what is not an IVF technique but ‘a pathway of care’.,After each of the presentations we discussed a wide range of issues with each other and the audience, from larger questions of when personhood begins to the development of
artificial embryos
, referring to remarkable research by Prof Zernicka-Goetz in Cambridge which has yielded the first artificial mouse embryos, created without the need for eggs or sperm.,All agreed that the legacy of Louise Brown’s birth is immense, from the boost that the pioneering work by Patrick Steptoe and, in particular, Robert Edwards, gave to basic reproductive science, prompting the introduction of a robust way to regulate these technologies (however, though the speakers agreed with the need for regulation, they also agreed there’s too much red tape).,In the wake of the birth of Louise Brown, scientists have revealed new details of human development, and why it goes awry, for instance in miscarriage and this research continues to give hope to vast numbers of couples who are unable to have a child.,You can listen to the conversion full here:"

acknowledged the remarkable advances in our knowledge about the biological clock that ticks in living organisms, including humans, to allow them to anticipate and adapt to the sunlight that drives so much of the living economy of the world.,At the end of this month, between 24 and 26 October, the Science Museum will host scientists from the University of Oxford’s

and
MRC Harwell
, the international centre for mouse genetics run by the Medical Research Council.,As part of our TW (Tomorrow’s World) Live programme scientists will be opening up their own

on 26 October, I will discuss the results of the world’s biggest sleep experiment with Adrian Owen, a leading neuroscientist based at Western University, Canada.,,One of the Trustees of the Science Museum Group is body clock expert Prof Russell Foster, Professor of Circadian Neuroscience, University of Oxford. He has, for example, discussed the importance of maintaining a good sleep cycle for the
mental and physical health of young people
and, with fellow university researcher Prof Denis Noble discussed the recent
Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology
awarded to Jeffrey C. Hall, Michael Rosbash and Michael W. Young for their pioneering efforts to peek inside our biological clock and elucidate its inner workings, a subject explored in more detail in the Science Museum’s
Who Am I?
update .,Using fruit flies, the Nobel laureates isolated a gene that controls the normal daily biological rhythm: in 1984, Hall and Rosbash, working in collaboration at Brandeis University in Boston, and Michael Young at the Rockefeller University in New York, succeeded in isolating the period gene.,Then Jeffrey Hall and Michael Rosbash went on to discover that PER, the protein that is encoded by this gene, builds up in cells during the night, and is then broken down during the day. Thus, PER protein levels wax and wane over a 24-hour cycle within the body, in synchrony with the circadian rhythm.,Subsequently, they identified additional components of this machinery, exposing the mechanism governing the self-sustaining clockwork inside living cells. Human clocks tick along very much the same lines to adapt our own physiology to the time of day.,Our health and wellbeing can be affected when the clock is disrupted, for example when we travel across several time zones and experience “jet lag”. There are also indications that chronic misalignment – for instance due to shift-work – between our lifestyle and the rhythm dictated by our inner timekeeper is associated with increased risk for various diseases, and that
sleep deprivation affects mental performance

But how did we get from mere dreams of flight to jumbo jets?","At the Museum,Collections and Objects","engineering,flight,transport,women in science","The dream of flight is as old as humanity.,Winged gods, horses and other such creatures abound the mythology of all ancient cultures. The best-known legend of human flight is that of Daedalus and Icarus and the disaster of flying too close to the sun.,However, the path from dreams to success was a long and arduous one. It took centuries of injuries and deaths before we arrived at the dawn of human flight.,The Middle Ages played host to feathered bird liked angels; fearsome creatures and devils flying on the wings of bats. This began an obsession with flapping flight, but these renaissance experiments were conducted with little to no understanding of how birds fly.,Despite this, fifteenth century Europe made tremendous strides in aeronautical science.,Leonardo da Vinci left over 500 sketches and 30,000 words in manuscripts devoted to flying machines, bird flight, and the nature of air.,Unfortunately, he too had a fixation with flapping flight:,‘A bird is an instrument working according to a mathematical law. It lies within the power of man to make this instrument with all its motions…’,Upon his death, his manuscripts and sketches were left to his misguided friend Francesco de Melzi who hoarded them for fifty years until they were haphazardly dispersed by his son.,Leonardo’s work did not become well-known until the 1880’s when aeronautical science had already become established.,After Henry Cavendish’s discovery of hydrogen in 1766, scientists, including Joseph Montgolfier, succeeded in flying small paper and cloth balloons filled with hot air.,On 21 November 1783, Montgolfier launched the first hot balloon.,These accents into the sky had a profound impact on contemporary culture; blossoming aeronautical art, fondly known as Ballooniana, of which we have a
rather lovely collection
.,The nineteenth-century saw the dawning realisation that real flight was possible, with  innovations from pioneers such as Sir George Cayley, Hiram Maxim, Otto Lilienthal, Samuel Franklin Cody and Lawrence Hargrave, and the founding of the Aeronautical Society of Great Britain in 1866.,We then entered the Age of Reason and the momentous success of the Wright brothers. Wilbur and Orville Wright, both born in Ohio, USA, were frustrated intellectuals who saw the dreams of flight as a personal challenge.,Wilbur once said ‘my observations have convinced me that human flight is possible…’. T
heir key insight was that birds kept their lateral balance by twisting and gliding with their wings.,On 17 December 1903, at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, after unusual amounts of persistence the Wright brothers achieved the first successful human flight.,On 14 December Wilbur had made their first unsuccessful attempt, having won the toss of a coin. He had stalled and landed rather clumsily.,It was, therefore, Orville’s turn to fly.,After setting up a tripod and camera to capture the hopefully successful moment, Orville took off for a full 12 seconds before striking the sand 36 meters from his take-off point.,He had achieved the first heavier-than-air flight.,Three more successful flights were made that day; on the last one Wilbur flew for 59 seconds and covered 260 meters.,The Science Museum has a very special history with the original Wright Flyer.,In 1928 Orville Wright loaned us the glider, and London became its home for the next twenty years. In 1948, after the end of his long-running feud with the Smithsonian Institute, Orville arranged for the glider to be returned to America and for an exact replica to be made for display here at the Science Museum.,What followed was a remarkable period of innovation and development catalysed by two global wars. Air transport quickly displaced
ocean liners
, and ‘bigger and faster’ became the common motto among engineers.,This period also saw a growing number of extraordinary female pilots including the great Amelia Earhart, Jean Baton and
Amy Johnson
, who defied the common belief that ‘women were not capable’.,,Visit our

Wonder Materials: Graphene and Beyond
, which tells the story of how two University of Manchester physicists ushered in a new age of 2D materials distinguished by their extraordinary composition and the thickness of one atom.,Now, as the exhibition continues its run at the
Hong Kong Science Museum
, PhD student Robbie Sinclair, Dr James Suter and Prof Peter Coveney at
The Centre for Computational Science
, University College London reveal today in the journal
Advanced Materials
why this famous roll of sticky tape was required to make graphene, the
first wonder material
.,When I discussed his ‘random walk’ to the discovery of graphene and the resulting
2010 Nobel Prize
with Andre Geim, he began with the work by his first PhD student, Da Jiang. In 2002, Geim asked to take a piece of graphite, the stuff of pencils, and isolate the thinnest sliver he could. He wanted to study a two-dimensional sheet of carbon atoms that had long been posited by theorists and was predicted to have fascinating electronic properties, but had never been seen.,After Da Jiang had reduced the graphite to dust, Geim’s Ukrainian postdoc Oleg Shklyarevskii had a better idea: why not use Scotch tape, which physicists used to clean graphite?,When they studied used tape, they found it was coated with ultrathin graphite: they knew that if they could get below 10 or so atomic layers it would become transparent, which raised Geim’s hopes that graphene could be made.,Here his fellow Nobelist Kostya Novoselov enters the story. Lo and behold, after around a year or so, they managed to isolate a hexagonal lattice of carbon atoms. The flat, parallel sheets of carbon atoms in the graphite of pencil lead could indeed be peeled apart to yield a single atomic layer with remarkable properties that promise myriad uses.,Now for the first time, the University College London team has successfully modelled the way that graphene sheets cling together in graphite, revealing why sticky tape is so good at prising them apart.,They are confident their model is correct because, as Sinclair explained, they have run their model in a supercomputer to simulate some remarkable experiments conducted in 2015 at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in Berkeley, California, where flakes of graphene skittering around on a graphite surface were studied using a special microscope with atomic resolution, called a
Scanning Tunnelling Microscope
.,,The microscope has a tip that can be used to push flakes of graphene around. They slide around like pucks in air hockey and, though the microscope can’t see this in real time, it can reveal where they end up.,In this way, they found that the 2D flakes only come to rest when the atoms in the graphene neatly line up with the atoms below, like stacking egg boxes, in what the chemists call a ‘commensurate state’. However, the lower the temperature, the further the flakes can travel because the underlying layer is smoother and less disturbed by jiggling caused by heat energy.,Newton’s laws can be used to predict these movements, even though the collisions between graphene scraps are ‘weird’: Dr Suter explained how they can ‘slither over each other, it is bizarre.’ Using a supercomputer and a virtual model of graphene, they got a good match with the observations made by the team in Berkeley.,As a bonus, their computer model shows why sticky tape is so good for peeling them apart, explained Prof Coveney. Peeling a layer demands only 40 per cent of the energy of shearing, rather like peeling egg boxes apart with a vertical motion is easier than pulling one horizontally across another when they are neatly stacked.,‘If shearing, then you get held up by this egg carton configuration. But if you peel, you can get them apart much more easily. The polymethyl methacrylate adhesive on traditional sticky tape is ideal for picking up the edge of the graphene sheet so it can be lifted and peeled.’ he explained.,‘The most remarkable thing here is that, despite the gazillions of publications there have been on graphene since its discovery, no one has bothered to ask how it interacts with itself over meaningful (atomic) length and time scales.’ added Prof Coveney.,‘The one reason above all others why the material is difficult to use is because it is hard to make,’ he added. ‘Even now, a dozen years after its discovery, companies have to apply sticky tape methods to pull it apart, as the laureates did to uncover it; hardly a hi-tech and industrially simple process to implement.’,‘So, we say that now we’re poised to be able to assist experimentalists to figure out how to prise it apart, or make it to order,’ said Prof Coveney. ‘That could have big cost implications for the emerging graphene industry.’,Around 270,000 people saw

Associate Curator, Rupert Cole, puts this down to chemistry.",Collections and Objects,"chemistry,medicine,the sun","As we slowly (and reluctantly) approach the end of summer we look back at the history of the seaside.,We Brits love the seaside. Especially in a heatwave. From Cornwall’s
struggle
to cope with ‘unprecedented mass tourism’ to the
exhibitions
and
museums
celebrating our coastal obsession during this scorchio summer.,But how did the seaside holiday become a popular pastime? Conveniently for my blog-writing agenda, it was (partly) down to chemistry.,The first proto-seaside resorts sprung up in the 1730s. This followed the well-established medical pursuit of ‘taking the waters’ at spa towns, such as Bath and Buxton. Patients suffering from a range of ailments, from melancholia to gout, were prescribed both immersion and the drinking of spa water.,Scarborough was the first seaside resort, probably owing to the fact it also had a mineral spa. Initially, it attracted sea-bathers, following the cold-water bathing fad that physicians like
Sir John Floyer
advocated.,It was not until the middle of the 18
th
century that sea-water began to replace spa water as the curative liquid of choice. A Sussex physician called
Richard Russell
did more than anyone to popularise its therapeutic virtues.,Russell’s catchily-titled tome,
A Dissertation on the Use of Sea Water in the Diseases of the Glands: Particularly the Scurvy, Jaundice, King’s-evil, Leprosy, and the Glandular Consumption
, was a massive hit following its publication in English in 1752.,The
book
recommended a daily regime of drinking half a pint of seawater before bathing in the sea, followed by another half pint — which could be mixed with milk if desired. An optional extra was to be massaged with seaweed and then showered in heated (you guessed it) seawater.,Russell appealed to the authority of chemistry to justify his medical claims:,‘Let us see what the most accurate Enquirers into Nature, what Physicians and Chemists have observed of the Sea Water, and its principal Qualities, which are Four; the First is, Saltness; the Second, Bitterness; the Third, Nitrosity, or a nitrous Quality; and the Fourth, Unctuosity.’,Brighton owes its establishment as a popular seaside resort to Russell, who set up his practice there in 1753. When the
Prince of Wales
visited in 1784 to take a course of sea-bathing for glandular trouble, Brighton’s fashionable status was secured.,In the latter half of the 18
th
century a vast medical literature around the various aspects of the seaside resort emerged, from the right kind of sand (‘clean and tidy’) to the efficacy of cliffs for shelter.,Sea-air soon overtook seawater as the coastal resort’s foremost cure for everything. This followed the first attempts to chemically analyse air in the early 1770s.,Armed with a trough, a variety of chemical glassware and a mouse, the polymath
Joseph Priestley
pioneered the study of air, or ‘pneumatic chemistry’, as it was known.,Priestley devised a test for calculating the purity and goodness of air, which was carried out by chemists over Europe.,The Italian aristocrat
Marsilio Landriani
invented an instrument for performing Priestley’s test, the ‘
eudiometer
’ – from the Greek meaning ‘a measure for good air’. Landriani wrote to Priestley of the exotic places he had tested air, such as the Pontine Islands and the beaches of Tuscany.,In 1779 a Dutch chemist
Jan Ingenhousz
set out with a specially-made portable eudiometer to compare the purity and goodness of sea-air with land air, collecting samples from London, Gravesend and Ofsted beach in France.,Publishing his results
in the Royal Society’s illustrious journal, Ingenhousz found that ‘the air at sea and close to it is in general purer and fitter for animal life’.,As well as backing up anecdotal and medical beliefs, eudiometers were used to compare the quality of sea-air at different resorts. But not all were convinced.,In her
last and unfinished novel
about a fictional seaside resort, Jane Austen made seaside health a recurring subject of satire through the comic character of Mr Parker, who suffers from a sprained foot:,‘No person … could be really in a state of secure and permanent health without spending at least six weeks by the sea every year. The sea air and seabathing together are nearly infallible … anti-spasmodic, anti-pulmonary, anti-septic, anti-bilious and anti-rheumatic.’,Medical claims
about sea air and sea water persist to this day, even prompting the
NHS in 2012
to issue public advice in interpreting reported studies.,If I could, I’d be inclined to follow both Landriani and Mr Parker’s example and spend at least six weeks on a Tuscan beach every year…,Learn more about humanity’s relationship with our nearest star in

In May 1969, this module launched astronauts Thomas Stafford, John Young, and Eugene Cernan, on a lunar orbital mission as a dress rehearsal for the Apollo 11 landing in July 1969.,The command module was the only part of the Apollo spacecraft to return to Earth, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean where the spacecraft and astronauts were recovered by helicopter and aircraft carrier.,This is one of a series of models made 1884-6, showing the astronomical instruments of the Jaipur Observatory, India. Built of masonry the Jaipur instruments were used to accurately measure the position of the Sun, stars, moon and planets. Lacking telescopes these devices used naked eye sights and massive, but precise construction. Known as Rashnalaya (Zodical Dials), they were built and designed under the supervision of Maharajah Jai Singh II. Finding European, Islamic and Hindu astronomical tables inaccurate, Singh decided to make his own observations to improve matters. As ruler of Rajastan, he built several observatories starting in 1724 with one near Delhi. You can view this in more detail

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/rise-of-the-quantum-compass/,Roger Highfield,Rise of the Quantum Compass,"Roger Highfield, Director of External Affairs, glimpses the future of navigation.",At the Museum,"engineering,QE Prize","When James Spilker visited the Science Museum after sharing the world’s most prestigious engineering prize, he was keen to discuss how he now wants to replace the Global Positioning System (GPS) that won him the accolade.,In the 1960s,
Spilker
wrote papers on signal timing technology that made possible the precision tracking of Earth orbiting satellites necessary for GPS, contributing to the original GPS architecture, hardware to coordinate timing and tracking, and the design of the GPS civil signal structure that now serves billions of people.,﻿,When we met in the Science Museum after he became one of the four winners of the 2019
Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering
, he told me that he now advises a company working on a quantum compass that could pave the way for global navigation technologies that do not rely on satellites and external signals.,The answer is to use accelerometers, which measure how an object’s velocity changes over time so that, using the starting point of the object, the new position can be calculated.,Though ubiquitous in mobile phones and laptops, conventional accelerometers struggle to remain accurate over long periods without being recalibrated.,The next generation of navigation technology could well be the quantum accelerometer, a self-contained system that, unlike GPS, does not rely on any external signal which can be disrupted by tall buildings, or can be jammed, imitated or denied – preventing accurate navigation.,The quantum accelerometer relies on using lasers to manipulate atoms in a cell and seeing how they are affected by acceleration.,These measurements are made with an ‘optical ruler’, called an atom
interferometer
, which works very much like optical interferometry, a 200-year-old technique widely used to make highly accurate measurements.,The optical method compares two equal beams of light, created with a device called a beam splitter, by making them overlap to create an interference pattern if one beam has had a slightly different journey from the other.,Radio waves act this way too along with atom interferometry because, just as waves of light can act like particles called photons, atoms can be cajoled into acting like waves if cooled to near absolute zero, which is possible with the help of lasers using
a Nobel Prize winning method
.,As with optical interferometry, atom waves cross at the detector, creating an interference pattern. If the path an atom takes varies by even a
picometer
, an atom interferometer can detect the difference.,James Spilker has dedicated his life to ultra-precise navigation. In 1973, he co-founded Stanford Telecommunications, a military satellite communications and GPS company which he grew to over 1,300 employees in 5 states when he sold it in 1999.,In 2005, he co-founded the Stanford University Center for Position, Navigation and Time, continuing the link with the university where, despite his humble origins, he first gained his degree and doctorate, where he will donate his Queen Elizabeth prize money.,Today he wants to use GPS to guide drones along ‘virtual tunnels in the sky’, or help Elon Musk with his
Boring Company
, which is working on Loop and Hyperloop public transportation systems. ‘I look at problems from a different perspective from other people,’ he said.,However, a glimpse of the next generation of navigation technologies came in 2006, when Spilker joined
AOSense
, based in Sunnyvale, California, one of several teams now developing innovative atom optic devices.,Navigation is one application, but atom optics can also be used for fundamental research, such as in the search for dark energy and gravitational waves.,Spilker coedited and contributed to Global Positioning System: Theory and Applications (1996), the standard reference for GPS and, in the light of advances in atomic interferometry, is working on a new book, Position, Navigation, and Timing Technologies in the 21st Century: Integrated Satellite Navigation, Sensor Systems, and Civil Applications."

, it was far from easy to weigh up the impact on innovation, society, economic prosperity and job creation from the long list drawn from the initial crop of around 500 individuals and teams put forward by the public, patent examiners and patent offices.,After a day of discussions at the European Patent Office in Munich earlier this year we came up with the following shortlist of 15 finalists in five categories, announced today:,Klaus Feichtinger and Manfred Hackl (Austria), higher-performance plastic recycling. Their patented ‘Counter Current technology’ means that a wider variety of plastic waste can now be turned into pellets, ready for reuse. Today, more than 6,000 of their machines produce over 14.5 million tons of pellets annually.
More here,Antonio Corredor Molguero and Carlos Fermin Menéndez Diaz Molguero (Spain), concrete mould for better breakwaters to protect harbours. Their unique method of producing specially shaped concrete blocks can reduce construction costs up to 45%. Their patented Cubipod block has protrusions, which prevents blocks from moving over time to settle face to face – a ‘self-packing’ arrangement – and helps maintain the integrity of the breakwater.
More here,Alexander van der Lely and Karel van den Berg (Netherlands), milking robots for healthier cows. These Dutch inventors have devised a robot that enables cows to decide when and how often they are milked. It’s estimated that a farm with 120 cows could achieve an extra 1 litre per cow per day production capacity when cows decide when they want to be milked twice a day.
More here,Jérôme Galon (France), Immunoscore, a clearer cancer test. The French immunologist’s diagnostic tool uses digital images of tumour samples and advanced software to measure immune response, improving the accuracy of prognosis and risk of relapse in cancer patients. The strength of the immune system plays a key role in fighting cancer and his Immunoscore quantifies this response of colon cancer patients at the site of the tumour. Thanks to Galon’s invention, already in use at clinics around the world for colorectal cancer, doctors can provide more effective treatment.
More here,Matthias Mann (Germany), protein analysis to diagnose disease. German proteomics pioneer Matthias Mann developed ‘nano-electrospray’ to extract proteins before interrogating and identifying them. To do this, the process vaporises the proteins after their extraction and charges them electrically. Once charged, the mass and identity of each protein can be inferred from how far it is deflected by a magnetic field. Thousands of proteins are simultaneously sequenced. By understanding the unique combination of proteins at work inside a patient, doctors can create personalised treatments.

Based in Paris, this Italian oncologist and molecular biologist developed blood filtering technology that makes it possible to detect cancer cells long before a tumour can be spotted with standard imaging techniques. The quick, non-invasive test can identify a single circulating tumour cell in a 10-millilitre blood sample, or roughly one in 50 billion red blood cells. In one clinical trial, ISET was able to detect cancerous tumour cells in blood up to four years before cancerous lung nodules would have become visible on conventional CT scans.

Sea lice, typically no larger than 15 millimetres long, attach themselves to salmon, causing an open wound and, in many cases, killing the fish. Norwegian marine engineer Esben Beck has developed underwater robots that use image recognition, AI and lasers to identify, target and zap the parasites without using chemicals or antibiotics. Stereoscopic cameras and image recognition software scan fish for sea lice, then a computer models the path of the salmon, directs movable mirrors to lock its laser beam onto the louse and fires a short pulse of intense green light which is lethal to the dark-coloured parasites but reflects off the salmon’s shiny scales.

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/scrambled-phones/,Sheila Mair,Scrambled phones,Top Secret volunteer Sheila Mair explores the evolution of scrambler phones used during the Second World War. ,"At the Museum,Exhibitions and Galleries","Second World War,Top Secret","The first scrambler phones were invented prior to the Second World War to secure voice transmission for commercial use.  You can think of a scrambler as an encryption device for analogue signals – an analogue signal is a continuously varying, smooth signal, whilst a digital signal has discrete values.,Standard digital encryption works by applying mathematical functions to the digital data to produce codes.  Scrambling works by taking an analogue waveform and modifying the frequencies in a way that makes it incomprehensible. The wave is then unscrambled, a process that transforms the wave back to its original form.,Secraphone,This scrambler phone, which later became known as the Secraphone, was developed in the UK in the late 1930s by the General Post Office (GPO).,The Secraphone consists of two parts.  Firstly, the scrambler – originally called a frequency changer – constructed using valve technology.  The second part was a handset which, traditionally for scrambler phones, had a green or lime green handpiece. The handset was based on a standard handset in use at the time and was normally placed on a desk with the scrambler under the desk or in a different room.,To operate the phone, the call was initiated in the normal way.  In the case of the Secraphone, which had no dialling capability, this would have been through a switchboard operator.  Once the call was set up, both parties pressed their ‘Secret’ button.  Anyone listening in on the line would now hear unintelligible noise.,If the switchboard operator tried to attract the attention of the Secraphone callers, they would hear the operator as unintelligible and would need to press their ‘Engage For Secret’ button to hear the operator while holding the secret call.,The scrambler worked using a technique known as ‘Frequency Domain Scrambling’.  Essentially, the telephone signal was inverted around a chosen frequency, so that the high frequencies become low and vice versa.,However, this type of scrambler was really only secure against the casual eavesdropper such as a telephone engineer or switchboard operator.  It was easy to break as it was only necessary to find the inversion frequency and re-invert to unscramble the signal.,In fact, the frequencies were not changed much by inversion so that an experienced listener was often able to get a sense of the message without unscrambling.,The scrambler was used by Winston Churchill during the early part of the Second World War to communicate with the government and the military.,The Bell Labs A-3 Scrambler,In the early 1940s, a scrambling system known as the Bell Labs A-3 scrambler was used in transatlantic communications including those between Churchill and Franklin D Roosevelt, President of the United States, during the Second World War.,The A-3 used the same technology as the Secraphone but was more complex with the signal being split into 5 bands, each of which could be plain or inverted every 15-20 seconds.,Unfortunately, at least one German engineer had worked at Bell Labs before the war and was, therefore, able to develop equipment that could decode the conversations in real-time.,Both the US and Britain were aware that calls were being monitored by the enemy and introduced a system of censorship.  Before each call, a censor would explain the ‘rules’ of the call to both parties and make a shorthand transcription of the call.  At the same time, the censor would listen for any potential breaches of security regulations such as military details, food supplies, bomb damage, and immediately disconnect the call.,Ruth Ive was a telephone operator and acted as one of the censors for Churchill’s calls.  In her book ‘The Woman who censored Churchill’ she recalls how she had to disconnect one of Churchill’s calls as he was about to describe a daytime V2 rocket attack on a London Street market, resulting in dozens of casualties.,Callers were not allowed to identify themselves by name, however, the German interpreters quickly recognised key callers such as Roosevelt and Churchill, even though they referred to themselves as Mr. Smith and Mr. White.,Although the Allies were able to break German text encryption systems, such as Enigma, and had superior text encryption systems that were not broken by the Germans, the opposite is true for voice communications where the Germans were superior. From the autumn of 1941 to July 1943, when a new scrambler system known as SIGSALY was introduced, the Germans were able to intercept, decrypt and listen to almost every word spoken through the A3 encryption system.,SIGSALY,SIGSALY (the word is made up rather than an acronym) was also known as ‘The Green Hornet’ because of the buzzing sound of the signal.  It was developed by Bell Labs and introduced in 1943 for scrambling the highest levels of secure communication.  Alan Turing was also involved in the design, validating the security of the system.,SIGSALY worked by first digitising the speech signal and then encrypting the signal by adding in a digitised random noise signal which acted as a key.  The random noise was generated using electronic valves and stored on a phonograph record.,Each record was duplicated – one for each end of the conversation – and was capable of holding 12 minutes of noise or key information.  The system also included a synchroniser to ensure that both ends of the system remained in synchronisation.,SIGSALY was based on valve technology and was huge – weighing 55 tons, taking up 2500 square feet of space and requiring 30,000 watts of power.  Because of the enormous amount of heat generated, air conditioning was required. It was far too bulky to be stored anywhere in Whitehall and was, therefore, situated in the basement of Selfridges.,SIGSALY technology employed many technological ‘firsts’ and was in operation until 1946.  During this time, there is no record of any conversations being broken.,This was originally posted in support of our

, from the National University of Ireland, Galway, started the
Diabetes Drone project in 2017
after he noticed that many of his patients were unable to reach his clinic due to flooding caused by
Hurricane Ophelia
.,People living in remote geographic areas can become isolated for several days if the roads into their communities are blocked by snowdrifts or flooding. This can create a medical emergency for those with diabetes if they run out of glucagon or insulin, the lifesaving medications that help manage their blood sugar levels.,In Ireland and the UK, one in every 16 adults is currently living with diabetes. Climate models suggest that severe storms are becoming more frequent and there are many people who could be put at risk if a natural disaster prevents them from restocking their medications.,Professor O’Keeffe realised that drones could provide a technological solution to this problem.,Drones had
already been tested around the world
for deliveries of other medical supplies, including defibrillators and vaccines, but had not yet been trialled to carry insulin or glucagon.,After a year of planning and collaborating with university and industry partners, the Diabetes Drone team was ready for their first test flight in September 2019.,The drone, named the Seagull, took off from Connemara Airport and travelled more than 21 kilometres to Inis Mor, one of the Aran Islands off the west coast of Ireland. It then carried a blood sample back to physicians on the mainland.,,The Seagull’s flight was autonomous beyond visual line of sight, or BVLOS, meaning it was out of the researchers’ sight for most of its journey. To make sure the flight was progressing according to plan, the team monitored the drone using a mobile phone network.,The successful test marked not only the first time a drone was used to deliver diabetes medication, but also the first time a drone was in contact with air space regulators throughout an autonomous BVLOS delivery.,While the Seagull remained autonomous throughout the 43 km round trip, there were teams of researchers at either end of the flight path to ensure the take-off and landing happened safely. They also made sure that the insulin and glucagon were dispensed and transported according to health and safety regulations and scheduled the delivery to occur between commercial flights to limit any disruptions.,While the Seagull’s flight was experimental, it demonstrates that with careful planning, drones could make regular deliveries of medical supplies and help ensure that people around the world have fast and reliable access to the medications they need.,See the insulin and glucagon pens that were used in this successful delivery on display in our

Thought to have originated with Queen Victoria and passed down through the female line, both the disease and women as potential carriers, played an integral role in shaping the political landscape of 20th century Europe.,The royal disease is thought to have originated with Queen Victoria. As neither her maternal or paternal side had previously displayed symptoms of the disease, scientists believe that it was the result of a genetic mutation.,Haemophilia is thought to be passed down through the female line, and many of Victoria’s female descendants had married into other European royal families. As a result, haemophilia presented itself in various royal bloodlines throughout Europe including Spain, Russia, and Prussia. Some of these royal families took precautions to secure their bloodline, but others were not so careful.,Despite warnings from King Edward VII and the Spanish Ambassador, King Alfonso XIII of Spain married Princess Victoria Eugenie, a granddaughter of Queen Victoria. This decision had a significant impact on Spain’s political stability.,While Spain was a constitutional monarchy, the King still played a significant role. Under Spanish law, an heir who was physically compromised could not take the throne.,While they had seven children only their fourth son Juan was unaffected. But public opinion turned on Victoria Eugenie, as she was cruelly accused of “defiling” the Spanish royal bloodline and her husband began to distance himself from her. Their marriage was discredited, and the monarchy became weakened.,But not all royal families felt the effects of haemophilia quite as significantly.,The Princess Royal Victoria Adelaide (daughter of Queen Victoria), actively discouraged her own son Wilhelm from marrying the daughter of her sister Princess Alice, as one of Alice’s sons was believed to have been haemophiliac. She instead encouraged her son to seek out other matches, and he eventually married his second cousin Augusta Victoria, producing six healthy sons.,Wilhelm’s brother Heinrich, however, was permitted to marry another of Alice’s daughters, Irene. Unfortunately, both of their sons were born with haemophilia, and the younger son sadly died from the disease at the age of four.,Interestingly, the royal family from which the disease originated escaped the fate of many of their European counterparts. Queen Victoria’s son, King Edward VII was not affected by the disease and neither were any of his heirs.,However, according to some historians before marrying Nicholas, the Tsarina Alexandra turned down a proposal from Edward’s eldest son, the Duke of Clarence. Had the Tsarina accepted this marriage, haemophilia might have been reintroduced back into the direct line of British rule, with potentially devastating consequences.,This blog was written alongside our free exhibition The Last Tsar: Blood and Revolution, exploring the life and death of Tsar Nicholas II and his family and the forensic investigation into their murder.

ast year
I enjoyed so much that I rolled it over into this year. It was to be more French. As well as taking more care with my apparel and taking a proper lunch break, I wanted to drink good wine.,Enjoying good quality wine without breaking the bank is not easy. Even one or two glasses can leave you feeling out-of-sorts the next day (please do drink responsibly).,If only I had one of Jules Salleron’s handy
wine-testing kits
.,Based in Paris, Jules Salleron (1829-1897) manufactured
scientific instruments
to test the standard of wine in the late-nineteenth century.,In 1871, vineyards in southern France had been
devastated by the phylloxera beetle
(read Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat’s
A History of Food
for more details). With wine in short supply, adulterated and even artificial wines began to appear on the market. Sugar, dyes, sulfuric and tartaric acid were all used to disguise bad products.,The use of dyes in adulterated and artificial wines in this period is apparent from Salleron selling apparatus to detect the presence of fuschin dye.
Fuschin
is a suspected carcinogen, and not something you would want in your wine.,In the Science Museum Group Collection, we have
Salleron’s vino-colorimètre
, an instrument designed to measure the colour of red wines.,Included in the vino-colorimètre is a scale used to compare against samples of red wine, with ten varying shades of red to violet red. Salleron took these shades of red from French chemist Michel Eugène Chevreul’s system of classifying and identifying colours.,In the 1930s, red wines of the same alcoholic percentage but with a stronger colour could be
sold for more money
. Today measuring the colour of wine is no longer a real concern for the wine industry, but Salleron’s other invention –
the ebulliomètre
– is
still in use today
.,This device determines the alcoholic content of wine by accurately measuring the boiling point of the liquid being sampled. As the boiling point of alcohol (ethanol) is 78˚C (compared to 100˚C for water), the more alcohol you have in your wine, the lower the boiling point would be.,So next time you have a glass of wine, raise a glass to Salleron, who has been saving us from sore heads since the late-nineteenth century!,Delve into

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/in-search-of-perfect-sound-introducing-britains-largest-horn-loudspeaker/,a guest author,In Search Of Perfect Sound,,"Collections and Objects,Exhibitions and Galleries","art,blythe house,design,engineering,media space,music and sound","A long black metal tube, slightly tapered and almost 9-foot-long lay on a row of filing cabinets at Blythe House, the Science Museum’s storage facility.,The object was pointed out by John Liffen, the Museum’s Curator of Communications, who guided me during a research visit of the collections in 2008.,It was all that remained of a mighty horn loudspeaker that was demonstrated in the Museum during the 1930s, John explained. A demolition accident had almost totally destroyed it in 1949.,Now the tube assumed a more fascinating form, like a fossil or a dinosaur bone as we delved into audio archeology. The story of the horn, researched in great detail by John, sparked an interest in me. Four years later in 2012, on being appointed as the Museum’s first-ever sound artist-in-residence, I was given a wonderful opportunity to initiate its reconstruction.,The exponential horn loudspeaker was designed in 1929 by the Museum’s curator of  ‘Electrical Communication’ R. P. G. Denman who also personally built a radio receiver to run in tandem with it.,The purpose of this new sound system was to provide the public with demonstrations of the highest quality broadcast sound that was obtainable at the time. Denman saw it as setting a benchmark for audio quality, his aim was, in his words “to provide a standard by which commercial apparatus could be judged”.,The horn measured 27 feet (8.23m) in length with a cross-section that curved exponentially from 1
1/16
inches (27mm) to a massive 7-foot-1-inch square (2.16m sq.) at the horn mouth.,The science and theory of how horns propagate sound had only begun to emerge in the mid-1920s. It was found that a horn with an exponential shape was the most effective means of converting the sound energy from high pressure, low-velocity vibrations produced at the narrow end of the horn, into low pressure, high-velocity vibrations at its mouth then radiated into the outside air.,However, in order to reproduce the lowest sounding frequencies, this type of horn has to be very long with a correspondingly large opening.,Denman, an expert on loudspeakers, specially designed the horn in order to reproduce frequencies as low as 32Hz and up to 6kHz. This was achieved by loading it to one of the latest moving-coil driver units from the Western Electric Company (U.S.A.) namely the WE 555W, widely used in cinema sound systems of the time and now considered to be one of the greatest loudspeaker drivers ever made.,From 1930 until the outbreak of WWII in 1939, the apparatus was demonstrated daily in the Museum’s Radio Communication gallery. The giant horn mouth appeared on the wall above the entrance while the rest of it hung conspicuously in the adjacent Agricultural Implements gallery. It was built into the Museum’s infrastructure and may be described as being its very first sound installation.,Concerts broadcast on the BBC’s London Regional programmes provided the content for the demonstrations. Critical reactions were positive and for audiences at the time, accustomed to limited bandwidth, interference, and distortion, the sound must have truly been a revelation. The Museum’s Radio gallery became a popular lunchtime destination, where sandwiches were cheerfully munched while listening to the classics or Wurlitzer cinema organ music, the audio reproduced in glorious full-range. It left an indelible impression on those who heard it, including John Liffen’s own uncle. Writing in the Audio Engineering Society Journal of April 1975, the audio experts Percy and Geoffrey L. Wilson opined that “no superior loudspeaker has to date been demonstrated in Britain”.,Fast-forward to 2014 and we have an opportunity to hear the horn again.,This is thanks in no small part to the magnificent efforts of the Museum’s Workshops who undertook the reconstruction project with gusto. The missing 18-feet of the horn was rebuilt over an intense 8-month period following Denman’s original specification, although fiber-glass was used in place of the original lead and tin alloy. Led by the Workshops manager Steve Long, the team has succeeded in recreating the single largest loudspeaker in Britain.,The programme for the upcoming installation is a mixture of past and present, allowing us to listen to the horn in old and new ways.,Archive material from the BBC will be heard alongside recent recordings made within the Science Museum. Resonance 104.4FM will be resident in the space, broadcasting live from the Museum, while lunchtime concerts via BBC Radio 3 will mirror the original demonstrations of the 1930s.,A series of events, including live music, poetry and performance will also showcase new works for the horn created by a variety of artists, writers, and radio programme-makers.,The title, “In Search of Perfect Sound”, refers to Roderick Denman’s quest for audio nirvana. Our modern ears may have become accustomed to high fidelity audio and surround sound, but the exponential horn, with its extraordinary sound presence and a distinct three-dimensional effect, still holds an immersive power of its own.,I’m very proud to have played a part in giving the Denman horn a new lease of life and to have witnessed its exponential metamorphosis, from that modest-looking metal tube, cocooned above all those filing cabinets.,Aleks Kolkowski
is a sound artist, violinist, and composer with a special interest in early sound recording and reproduction technology.,The Exponential Horn: In Search of Perfect Sound opened at the Media Space Studio on 20 May 2014."
https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/the-father-of-the-space-age/,Doug Millard,The father of the space age,"Curator Doug Millard explores the unknown story of the father of the space age, Sergei Korolev. ",Exhibitions and Galleries,"alexei leonov,cosmonauts,exploration,space,valentina tereshkova,yuri gagarin","In December 1965
Sergei Pavlovich Korolev
was finally put in charge of the Soviet Union’s manned lunar programme. He would go on to lead its two projects: one to fly a cosmonaut crew around the Moon; the other to land one on the surface.,The nation’s secret assault on the Moon – a delayed response to President Kennedy committing the United States to do the same – had already faced huge challenges: insufficient funding; competing schemes and design bureaux; poor organisation.,But many felt that if anyone could pull off the seemingly impossible it would have been Korolev: the man who had steered the Soviet Union into space with a string of firsts between 1957 and 1965 – the first artificial satellite (
Sputnik
), first animal in orbit (
Laika, a dog
), first man in space (
Yuri Gagarin
), first woman in space (
Valentina Tereshkova
), first multiple crew and the
first space walk
(
Alexei Leonov
).,He had never been publicly named during these glory years, known only as the Chief Designer.,He was a remarkable man: a first-rate engineer, designer, and quite a brilliant manager who ran much of the Soviet missile industry and most of its space sector.,He also knew how to get the best out of large numbers of workers in many different institutions
and
keep his political masters in the Kremlin happy.,His iron will, determination and energy were remarkable – it had helped keep him alive during the dark days of his imprisonment in the Gulag in eastern Siberia.,In 1938, while listening to a new gramophone record with his wife in their Moscow apartment, there was a knock on the door and the secret police came in to ransack their rooms.,He was taken away and accused – falsely – of sabotage against the state.,This was the period of Stalin’s notorious purges when any perceived internal threat to the Soviet Union resulted in imprisonment at best and execution at worst.,Korolev survived his ordeal in the Gulag but many of his rocketry peers did not.,…,Vasily Mishn was appointed Chief Designer after Korolev’s death in January 1966.
He too was a great engineer but without the drive and courage of Korolev.,Last year Alexei Leonov – the first man to walk in space –
told me when visiting the Science Museum
that in his opinion, the Soviet Union, even had Korolev lived, would not have landed on the Moon before the US.,But he added that Mishin’s hesitation to send a cosmonaut crew
around
the Moon would not have been Korolev’s way.,Korolev, Leonov reckons, would have launched a crewed mission and perhaps beaten the Americans in doing so.,As it was, the Soviet’s unmanned
Zond 5 spacecraft
in September 1968 became the first to fly around the Moon and return safely to the Earth. A menagerie of small creatures and plants were on board including two tortoises.,Three months later the Americans’
Apollo 8 spacecraft
repeated the feat but this time with a human crew of three. Within months the Americans trumped this when
Neil Armstrong
and
Buzz Aldrin
took the first footsteps on the lunar surface.,Who knows what might have happened had the Soviets beaten the Americans in going round the Moon? History may have followed an entirely different trajectory.,Korolev’s anonymity came to an end immediately after his death. He was given a state funeral and his ashes interred in the Kremlin’s walls.,This post was originally published to accompany

The answer is obvious, yet surprisingly between 1912 and 1948 art competitions were officially part of the Olympic Games.",Collections and Objects,"art,collection project,discover the collection,medals,olympics,sport","With an early proposed event consisting of a 14km race and a written essay, it’s not surprising it took years – 16 in total – for
Baron Pierre de Coubertin
to have his suggestion of introducing Art Competitions into the modern Olympics accepted.,The Baron, the founder of the
International Olympic Committee
, believed that the marriage of sport and art restored the Olympiad to that of Ancient Greece and its original beauty. A true Olympian was not simply the quickest swimmer or the furthest long jumper, but also a painter or musician.,Resistance to the idea was understandable. Judging the arts is surely subjective. However, the decision to include Art Competitions was unanimous in the 1908 Olympic Games.,Medals were to be awarded for works of art inspired by sport, divided into five categories: architecture, literature, music, painting, and sculpture.,Unfortunately, the
1908 London Olympics
was marked by frustration and disappointment, particularly due to issues with transporting and displaying works at the Games. The backing of the
Royal Academy of Arts
and its President,
Sir Edward Poynter
, ensured curiosity amongst global artistic communities.,The Art Competition was ultimately abandoned for these Games but this first attempt ensured Art made an energised leap off the starting block and the next Games held in Stockholm in 1912.,On two occasions a husband and wife have competed against one another for the Art medals. Sculptors, James Earl Fraser and Laura Gardin Fraser (who created
this medal
now in the
Science Museum Group Collection
) battled it out to represent the USA, while painters
Laura Knight
and Harold Knight fought for Great Britain – all during the 1928 Amsterdam Games.,Only Laura Knight walked away with a medal. It was in 1916 that Knight received a £300 commission to paint a canvas for the Canadian Government War Records office on the theme of Physical Training in a Camp, and produced a series of paintings of boxing matches at Witley in Surrey, the wartime home for many Canadian First World War soldiers.,It was this work that would inspire her 1928 Silver Medal winning painting ‘The Boxer’. The following year, she became a Dame, and in 1936 became the first woman ever elected as a member of the Royal Academy. Her retrospective exhibition there in 1965 was also the first for a woman.,Knight continued to produce posters for British travel and holiday destinations throughout her career, including
this poster
for London & North Eastern Railway.,In her long career, Knight was among the most successful and popular painters in Britain. Her achievements in the male-dominated British art world paved the way for greater visibility and recognition for women artists.,The only known disabled artist to participate in the Art Competitions was
Alfred R. Thomson
from Great Britain, who won a Gold Medal for his painting ‘London Amateur Championships’ in the 1948 London Olympics. He was deaf and user of British Sign Language.,Although Thomson attended the London Art School in Kensington, he was largely self-taught. Thomson is most notable for completing several commissions for the War Artists’ Advisory Committee during World War Two and in September 1942 became a full-time salaried artist attached to the Air Ministry.,This led to his appointment as a Royal Academician and he soon became a highly respected society portrait painter. He continued to paint murals, including for the Science Museum (this
design sketch
is in our collection), Houses of Parliament and Queen Mary ocean liner. His work, along with his competitors, was displayed in seven of the V&A’s galleries throughout the 1948 London Olympic games.,The only artist to participate in every Art Competition was R. Tait McKenzie (who made
this bronze plaque
now in the collection). Of the one hundred and twenty-three individual pieces of sculpture he displayed for Canada, his work, ‘Shield of Athletes’, won him of the Bronze Medal in the Relief’s Medallions competition during the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics.,It was McKenzie’s childhood friend, James Naismith, the inventor of basketball, who sparked McKenzie’s fascination for sports while they attended McGill University. These friends, his medical studies, and involvement in athletics provided the fuel for his attempts at sculpture.,During the First World War, his methods and inventions for restoring and rehabilitating wounded soldiers laid a foundation for modern physiotherapy practices. Although all artists had to be living to compete in the Art Competitions, R. Tait McKenzie’s work was judged for the 1948 Games. Whether this was a clerical error or a small tribute to his death in 1938 is unknown.,The following games in 1952 marked the end of awarding medals for Olympic Art amid fears from the IOC Executive Committee that, as contestants were practically all professionals, these medals purely served as commercial advertising.,Although passionately contested by members of the IOC and artists from across the world, including a protest against this change by the German National Olympic Committee, in the 1952 Olympics in Helsinki the Art Competitions were replaced with non-medal awarding Art Exhibitions.,Since then there have been several international organisations and individuals who have attempted to reinstate the Art Competitions with no luck.,The awards for the Art Competitions were announced in the Olympic Stadium with the same fanfare on the victor’s podium as athletes, with flags flying and national anthems playing.,Although the 151 medals that had been awarded to these artworks have now been officially removed from the Olympic record, the fleeting moments of the Olympic Games and sport champions continue to be remembered through the enduring artistic creations of painters, musicians and architects.,It is amusing to imagine which contemporary creatives would be standing on those podiums today."

The other 92% of the collection is housed in storage facilities. One of these storage sites is a former airfield near Swindon, which holds 16,000 objects including large scale items such as aeroplanes, trains and cars.,The Hemcrete facility was designed as a radical new solution to protecting objects including horse-drawn carriages, fine art works, wooden ship models and paper archives. Many of these objects are sensitive to changing climate conditions such as light, heat and moisture so providing the right environment is essential to prevent deterioration.,The solution was to create a zero-carbon storage building from hemp and lime – low carbon natural materials which provide temperature and humidity buffering and ensure that the museum’s collections are maintained for future generations.,Matt Moore, Head of Sustainable Development, Science Museum said “I’m delighted that the Hemcrete project has won these awards and been recognised by the museums and building sectors. The project is part of a wider remit to reduce emissions across all our sites. Using science and engineering to look after the Science Museum collections seems to be a perfect solution to one of our biggest challenges.”,Hemcrete is a material made from hemp fibre and lime mortar mixed and moulded in precast, pre-dried cassettes to form Hemclad panels. The material is typically used to provide sustainable building materials for housing and industrial building sectors.,As well as protecting objects from deterioration, the Hemcrete facility allows the museum to reduce carbon emissions and make significant energy savings. The new store will be used to house valuable objects from the Science Museum as well as those of its sister museum – the

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/swindon-solar-farm/,Matt Moore,Swindon Solar Farm,,At the Museum,,"Today, one of the largest solar farms in the UK opened. Matt Moore, Head of the SMG Wroughton Site explains more.,Built at a former RAF airfield now owned by the
Science Museum Group
(SMG), the 88 acres of photovoltaic (PV) arrays will generate close to 50 GWh of energy each year. This is enough energy to power 15,400 homes, and is over
three times
the annual energy usage of
our Museums
in the SMG.,Who is building and operating the solar farm?,Public Power Solutions
initially developed the scheme and secured planning permission (as project rights developer) in partnership with the SMG. The solar farm was
granted planning consent
in March 2015 and from December 2015 British Solar Renewables became the owner, developer and operator of the solar farm.,British Solar Renewables has connected over 380 megawatts (MW) of photovoltaic arrays in the UK, and for this project will be using Polycrystalline PV modules manufactured by Jetion Solar. As many components as possible have been sourced in UK to minimise the solar farm’s carbon footprint during construction and operation.,The solar farm contains multiple rows of arrays, each containing photovoltaic panels on a steel and aluminium framework like a giant Meccano set. For the UK, the panels are mounted at a 20 degree angle to optimise power output.,The electrical works for the solar farm are more complex. When running, the PV panels generate electricity, producing it as direct current (DC). This is transmitted via large DC cables to a central inverter station, where it is converted to AC (alternating current). This passes through a step-up
transformer
, which increases the voltage to 33,000V, ready for the electricity to be transported over the
National Grid
(and helping minimise
transmission losses
).,,Remote monitoring systems have been installed to assess the farm’s performance and ensure faults can be identified and repaired as quickly as possible. Air and PV panel temperatures are monitored along with wind speed and light levels. This data can then be used to help determine the farm’s performance, measured as ratio between actual and theoretical performance.,The operation of a solar farm,Once operational, Swindon Solar Farm will require little attention beyond monitoring, maintenance and an occasional clean. The ground underneath the farm can provide a
significant area of habitat
for ground flora, for wildlife and for low-impact grazing.,Our aim is to help chalk-loving plants and in particular support
native pollinating insects
. The land under the farm will be managed by low-impact grazing and mowing over the 30-year lifespan of the array.,Native plants will colonise and thrive, bringing with them many other animals to become a buzzing, colourful haven for many under-threat species. Our site is part of the Marlborough Downs Space for Nature, a project that provides breathing spaces for wildlife on farms, and the solar farm will help contribute to the achievements of this project too.,Swindon Solar Farm will also set up a benefit fund for the local community, providing around £60,000 a year to help fund local projects.,Matt Moore is Head of the SMG Wroughton Site,Thanks to Merlin Douglas Johnson at BSR for support with this blog.,,Solar Farm Stats,"

Lots of users found texting to be a cheap way of sending a snippet of information, and by 2002 we were sending 2 million texts an hour in the UK alone.,The number of texts being sent around the world is still growing, but as our phones become the centre of our communications world, with social networks and email as well as texting and calling, the humble text message is going to have to work hard to stay in use."
https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/remembering-alexei-leonov/,Roger Highfield,Remembering Alexei Leonov,"Alexei Leonov became the first person to walk in space in 1965. A hero of space exploration, he was made a Fellow of the Science Museum in 2015. We remember his incredible story.","At the Museum,Science in the news","cosmonauts,space",",As Leonov ‘stepped into the abyss’, he was struck by the sound of his own breathing, his heartbeat and a sense of the universe ‘being limitless in time and space’.,Given that in the darkness the temperatures plunged to minus 140 °C and in sunlight rose to 150 °C his suit was ‘a stroke of genius’ for the way it kept him at a comfortable 20 °C.,But eight minutes into the spacewalk, he felt that his gloves had expanded so much that he could no longer feel them with his fingers. His legs started to shake. Leonov’s spacesuit had by now ballooned in space to an alarming degree. ‘I started feverishly thinking of what I was going to do to re-enter the spacecraft’.,First he had to coil his tether. Every 50 cm dangled a 2.5 cm diameter ring, which he was supposed to hook.’ But he had ‘no support’ and was hanging on by one hand. ‘It was very hard.’,He disobeyed the orders of the Soviet father of the space age,
Sergei Korolev
– there was no time to wait for a committee to be assembled to deliberate on his predicament – and opened a valve to bleed of some of the suit’s pressure, risking the bends by lowering the pressure beyond the safety limit.,On his back Leonov wore ‘metal tanks with ninety minutes’ worth of oxygen’ but it was clear from his talk that he remained concerned he had not left enough time for the nitrogen from the oxygen/nitrogen mix inside Voskhod to be purged from his blood. ‘There was a danger of nitrogen boiling in my blood and I was feeling this needling sensation in my fingers but I had no choice.’,Fortunately, ‘The feeling went away.’,Instead of entering legs first, as he had trained to do, Leonov went in head first, requiring ‘an awful amount of energy’ to turn around in the confines of the 1.2 m diameter airlock (he measured 1.9 m in his spacesuit). His core body temperature soared by 1.8 °C as he contorted himself. ‘That was the most stressful moment.’,Overall, the spacewalk lasted 12 minutes. By that time, Soviet state radio and television had stopped their live broadcasts.,The mission’s problems were far from over. The descent module’s hatch failed to reseal properly, leading to a slow leak. The craft’s automated systems flooded the craft with oxygen, raising the risk of fire of the kind seen in the Apollo 1 tragedy.,When they turned on their automatic descent systems, the spacecraft did not stop rotating. ‘It was difficult and dangerous to stop.’ Their automatic guidance system had malfunctioned. They asked Korolev for permission to conduct a manual descent, which the craft was not designed to do. ‘It was very similar to driving a car looking out the window from the side.’,From an ‘ancient Soviet radio station’ in Antarctica came permission, along with a note of caution: ‘Be careful.’,‘You know what, let us land in the Red Square, it would be so jolly funny,’ remarked Leonov, who was the mission navigator. Pavel Belyayev, commander, replied that they would ‘clip all the stars in the Kremlin so I don’t think we should do it’.,Eventually, Voskhod 2 ended up far from the primary landing zone on the steppes of Kazakhstan, in polar forests – taiga – around 180 kilometres from Perm in Siberia. ‘To us, the trees of 30-40 m looked like a manicured lawn.’ Leonov transmitted a call sign with a manual telegraph system – ‘everything is in order’ – but it was greeted by silence.,A gust of cold air entered when they opened the hatch. Belyayev jumped out and ended up neck deep in snow. Leonov was sloshing around knee deep in water in his spacesuit. They stripped in the cold and Leonov wrung out his underwear. ‘Can you imagine this picture – a spacecraft, the taiga, and naked chaps standing next to each other?’,The next day, ‘comrades on skis’ arrived and, after another night and a nine kilometre ski trip, they were picked up by helicopter.,Following Leonov’s historic
space flight
, he began training for a mission to the Moon, along with Oleg Grigoryevich Makarov (1933-2003).,To prepare for this complex lunar landing, Leonov learned how to cope with high g forces, made regular parachute drops from a helicopter and, since they did not have a Lunar Landing Training Vehicle, would take over the controls of a helicopter during rapid descent from altitudes as little as 100m, or land the helicopter with the engine turned off, when the main rotor turns by autorotation.,Despite this, the risks were never far from his mind.,On 27 March 1968, Leonov heard two distant explosions while training a group of cosmonauts in lunar landing techniques. Later that day it emerged that Gagarin had crashed during a training flight in a MiG-15.,The USSR planned for Leonov to land on the Moon in a craft known as the LK (Russian: Лунный корабль, “Lunniy korabl”, meaning “lunar craft”).,An earlier unmanned probe, the Lunokhod rover, would be used to select a landing spot, and then act as a beacon for a backup LK to be sent to the site. The third step would see a manned LK landing with a single cosmonaut. The Lunokhod would also provide the means to reach the backup LK, if needed.,The Russians however
were not successful
, and the title for first to land on the Moon went to the USA, with the
Apollo 11 landing
by Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong.,But as Leonov watched as Armstrong set his left boot on the lunar surface on 21 July, 1969, he thought hard about the words he would have chosen to share with the world if he had landed on the Moon.,﻿,On 17 July 1975, Leonov and NASA astronaut Thomas Stafford
made history
when they shook hands through an open hatch after Soyuz and Apollo spacecraft docked.,He remarked: ‘From space, one doesn’t see any borders. The Earth is our common home and we have to take care of it.’,Alexei Leonov will not only be remembered for his remarkable story as the first person to walk in space, but also for this lasting message that is as powerful today as it would have been looking out at Earth fifty years ago from the lunar surface.,Read

for his own personal use. You can see a selection of these ornate, finely made objects on display in the Science Museum’s new permanent gallery,
Science City 1550–1800: The Linbury Gallery
.,The young king’s interest in science, known then as natural philosophy, first developed through his childhood education but continued well into his adult life. In 1769, almost a decade into his reign, he had his own private observatory –
the King’s Observatory
– erected in the Old Deer Park at Richmond.,One of the grandest scientific instruments from this observatory, a mural arc, now stands proudly on the threshold of
Science City
.
At nearly three metres tall and four and a half metres long, its shiny brass silhouette is hard to miss.,The mural arc was made in 1770 by
Jeremiah Sisson
, one of the leading scientific instrument-makers of the day. Like a
quadrant
, it would have been used for making astronomical observations and measurements. But whereas quadrants can only measure angles through a span of 90°, this instrument has a very unusual arc of 142°. This meant that it could be used to observe all the circumpolar stars – those which never set below the horizon – visible from the latitude of London. In other words, it was made specifically for its location: the King’s Observatory.,This building still stands today. On his visit in 1777, the astronomer Thomas Bugge wrote that ‘The observatory stands in the middle of a beautiful plain’, and apparently benefited from clearer weather than the
Royal Observatory at Greenwich
.,Ideal conditions, then, for George III to use his mural arc. It was installed in the Observatory’s east wing, mounted on an internal stone wall and aligned with an obelisk in the grounds to the south so that accurate measurements could be taken. Shutters in the roof could be opened for the king to gaze skyward through the mural arc’s telescope.,A diagram of a mural quadrant from
Denis Diderot’s famous
Encyclopédie
helpfully illustrates how George III would have used the mural arc. The arc’s telescope would originally have been supported by a wooden frame to prevent it from bowing out of shape under its own weight.,This frame would have been connected by a lever to a counterpoise weight on the other side of the wall, which counterbalanced the weight of the telescope as its position was adjusted to any point along the 142° span of the arc. A stepladder would have been essential for reaching the arc’s upper range.,For display in the
Science City
gallery, George III’s mural arc underwent extensive conservation treatment to strip off old, discoloured and uneven lacquering and was restored to its original, beautiful bright satin finish.,Excitingly, this has made the finely engraved details on the arc much more visible, including Sisson’s signature and the scale divisions. There are even scratches and marks on the surface showing signs of previous use – perhaps some of them made by George III himself.,A bigger challenge was to take the mural arc out of Blythe House, the museum’s storage facility in West Kensington, transport it to the Science Museum and install it in the gallery. It wasn’t just the arc’s enormous size that made this a logistical nightmare. Weighing in at approximately 450 kilograms, it’s also very heavy – somewhat daunting when you have to hoist it in a sling up to the museum’s second floor.,Now that it’s finally in place in
Science City
, it makes a powerful statement about 18
th
-century London’s reputation for scientific instrument-making, and George III’s lesser-known passion for science.,Discover more about how royal patronage helped London grow into a global centre for scientific enquiry between 1550 – 1800 in our new permanent gallery –

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/in-interview-alexei-shulgin/,Science Museum,In Interview: Alexei Shulgin,Alexei Shulgin from media art production company Electroboutique answers some questions about the new pop up exhibition at the Museum.,Exhibitions and Galleries,art,"Alexei Shulgin, artist from media art production company
Electroboutique
responds to Head of Science Museum Arts Projects, Hannah Redler’s questions about his exhibition at the Museum, ‘Electroboutique Pop up’.,Electroboutique pop-up at the Science Museum consists of art objects, ‘products’ as you call them, slogans and texts. On the surface this seems like a move away from the area for which are particularly known, as a pioneer of net art. Can you say something about the shift in the focus of your practice, from bits and bytes and online environments to ‘(art) marketable products’, perhaps starting with a brief outline of what net art is (or was)?,Well net art was an avant-garde movement in the 90’s; that came to life after the emergence of the internet. I think net art was an ultimate modernism, an art practice that existed without institutional borders and was addressed to everyone (who had a computer and internet). I believe many of the net artists’ inventions were later used in construction of “web 2.0” which marries social networking and online shopping.,I think net art had served its role in the development of online capitalism and has become marginal around 2002-03. In the virtual world dominated by heavily controlled social/ commercial sites such as Facebook and eBay very little space is left for artistic exploration. That was one reason for me to search for the new. Another one was that by that time I was looking for new economical conditions of art production and making “commercial”, art-market ready art appeared to be the best option. Especially considering the almost non-existent support of art by the state in Russia where I was living by then. I was lucky to meet Aristarkh Cernyshev then and we decided to make a project together,
Super-I real Virtuality Goggles
. It went really well and we decided to go on with a collaboration, formed Electroboutique, rented a studio together and started developing our unique style on the intersection of pop art, design and interactive electronics, something that has not existed yet in the market.,What is the significance for you of this exhibition being in a Science Museum rather than an art gallery? How do you think the museum context and its very wide general audience might change the way the works will be experienced or received?,Yes, the Science Museum is great for us! Firstly, as I have already said before, the Science Museum shows at its best an unbreakable connection between history of capitalism, science, engineering, and design. With the Science Museum art programme we get all ingredients: we consider art an important institute of a capitalist society, one of its driving forces. This unity of art and capitalism is one of the focuses of our artistic exploration, which is why the Science Museum context works so well for us. And of course, being real modernists, we want to bring our art to the masses, to ordinary people, and not just to the snobbish art crowd. And where on earth we can find more diverse audience than in the Science Museum. We believe our works affect people on different levels. The first, entertaining one is addressed to all; but if you like to reflect a bit on the state of the world today – we offer this option too!,Can you say something more about your appropriation of the language of corporate social responsibility in the work, or why it became important subject matter for you? It’s not immediately the most obvious bedfellow for works which play so expertly with the outputs and aesthetics of mass media. But when one starts to think about the corporate world as a major driving force within new media and communication spaces, lots of questions start to arise. Is this in any way related to the political drivers that originally led you to practice as a net artist?,Perhaps. You know, you start being an artist because you feel the world around you is unbearable, you don’t see how you can participate in this circus. Then, you discover that art world is not any better, and you start looking for new frontiers. In the 90’s the internet was such a frontier; then after few years it has become a part of a banal and rude reality. I think it’s a kind of evil loop: you look for a new “temporary autonomous zone” to quote
Hakim Bey
, and you start exploring it and then, after a while and thanks to your efforts  it becomes eaten up by progressing capitalism.,When working on our electronic gadgets/art objects we have discovered that our production is quite similar to that of a “real” electronics company: same kind of chipboards, plastic, cameras. We work with contractors, we hire engineers and workers, we use a chinese labour force. We work on the market, we try to be innovative and offer new exciting products… Another world, our art production looks exactly like any other creative capitalist production. That’s why we decided to go further and use the current corporate marketing strategies such as declaring social responsibility and sustainability. And it all is true – we do care about world around us and we do try to make it better!,Your position also fluctuates quite irreverently between being sharply anticapitalist and a full-on creative entrepreneur luxuriating in the benefits of capitalism. In the text that goes along with your work ‘Commercial Protest’ you even promote this contradiction with the words “We protest against this state of affairs with this piece and set a fair price on it!” Tell us more!,Oh yes. Being anti-capitalist is a luxury, it’s a privilege of a first world citizen. You don’t see any “Occupy …” movements outside the Golden Billion countries. By sharpening the contradiction you are mentioning we want to emphasize the situation where critique of capitalism is in fact an essential part of the capitalist itself.,How do you think your takes on corporate marketing speak actually critique rather than reiterate the ideologies you’re commenting on?,We think we do both. By our creative critique we point out the weak points of capitalism and offer patches for them. We believe that contemporary art, along with science, is an avant-garde institute of a capitalist society. And one of its most important missions is developing new aesthetics and communications techniques for future use in product design, advertising and politics. Look globally – what is called ‘contemporary art’ flourishes in the societies with innovative capitalism, and is rather marginal and derivative in the others.,Many of the works in the exhibition either respond to, reflect or re-version viewers in real-time. How do the works create individualised experience for each audience member and how is it that these are a reflection of the audience themselves?,Well the initial reason for us to start making works like that was our desire to please the viewers, everybody just loves to appear in an art work. Such a ‘populist’ approach was our deliberate choice when we were starting. Also, placing an audience in an artwork makes communication between the two much easier. Today, media personalities and celebrities appearing on screen are very popular and attractive social figures, so we are playing with people’s desire to be one of them too. And yes, by including a viewer into our artworks we make their experience unique, and they appreciate it by loving (and buying) our works. And finally, it’s a practical trick, by pleasing our audience we manage to keep their attention for longer than average three seconds and communicate our critical messages while entertaining."

During our
Games Jam
last Friday, the six teams came up with six brand new games, playtested and perfected them – all in the course of a day.,We started off with four catalyst talks from gaming experts – I’ve summarised their
words of wisdom here
. After the talks we went on a tour of one of the galleries led by a curator. My team went around the
Who am I? Gallery
with Priya Umachandran and she picked out a few key objects sparked ideas.,Heads stuffed with inspiring stuff it was time to sit down in our groups. After setting the rules (no running, no fire-starting etc) the creative process kicked off with a free-ranging brainstorming session.,My group began thinking we might make a game about memory. This evolved into a classification game where people had to work out why objects had been grouped in different combinations. We even considered a poker-style card game where you had to create genetically modified creatures by collecting groups of characteristics.,Eventually we decided to go with a game where you had to bluff about really obscure looking objects. In our first, very quick and dirty playtest we were howling with laughter – it looked like we were on to something.,However, we were concerned that all we’d done was shift a familiar game into a new environment and we wanted something a bit more novel. So suddenly it got a bit political. We would divide our players into two teams – the scientists and the politicians. The politicians want to stop funding research and the scientists have to convince them that they deserve the money, but they might be bluffing…,Basic concept sorted we headed out to start playtesting in earnest. It didn’t start off well. In the first iteration it didn’t really seem like the politicians had much to do – they just sat and judged what the scientists had to say.,In the next iteration we decided to focus on the bluffing and ditch the politics. We took some pictures of crazy looking objects and asked people to write down their ideas. We then got the gamemaster to read them all out, along with the real answer. Again there were lots of problems. The gamemaster struggled to read out the descriptions in dodgy handwriting, and the real answers were really easy to spot.,But then it came together. On our third go we decided that half the fun was picking the objects out in the first place, so after assigning teams an area of the gallery we asked them to go away and take photos on their mobiles. They had to select objects that would be fun to bluff about, or that had descriptions that were so outlandish that people might not believe them.,Two or three teams take turns to describe an object and the others ask probing questions to try to catch them out. If the guessing team is right about it being true or a mighty bluff they get a point – if they get it wrong the describing team gets a point.,On Saturday we playtested it with real people. It’s really simple, easy to explain and can be played in any gallery. Plus it’s properly fun to play.,Here’s what the other groups came up with:,A bodysnatchers game in our medical galleries,A sickness and health game with evil nurses who want to make you sick,Darwin’s monster, a game where people team up and are assigned different abilities so they have to work together to survive,Rift, a game where you have to dash around the Museum to gather information to stop a rift in space and time opening between our Cosmos & Culture and Measuring Time galleries.,Nuclear Warning, a game where you had to design a new warning symbol and perhaps do a Russian Bear Dance.,We’ll be revealing the winning game soon…"

James Lovelock
has proved a hugely influential figure, from devising
extraordinarily sensitive pollutant detectors
to creating the
Gaia hypothesis
and
speculating about living with cyborgs at the end of this century
.,Given his range of achievements, it was a revelation when he recently told me that the most treasured moment of his life took place in the
Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena.
It was there that he successfully demonstrated a weight-saving invention to NASA engineers working on what would come to be known as the
Viking mission
– the only Mars landers specifically designed to detect life.,You can see Lovelock,
in an interview
to
mark his 100th birthday
, discuss this epiphany
here or below.,,In the 1960s the recently formed US space agency, NASA, began to prepare for the Viking mission and in March 1961 wrote to Lovelock in recognition of how he had developed small yet sensitive instruments that were ideal for such space missions.,His response came in the form of a weight-saving prototype instrument that could be used to analyse the composition of the Martian atmosphere. This prototype can be seen in
The Art of Innovation exhibition
at the Science Museum and is discussed in the accompanying
BBC Radio 4 series
and
book
by Sir Ian Blatchford, Director of the Science Museum Group, and Dr Tilly Blyth, Head of Collections.,Lovelock’s prototype would prove critical for Viking’s
Gas Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer
experiment, where a Mars sample would be introduced into a hydrogen carrier gas and its constituents separated in a heated palladium silver alloy tube.,Constituents travelled along this tube at different speeds, before being analysed by a mass spectrometer which, as its name suggests, identifies chemical constituents by their mass.,The separation device that Lovelock fashioned in his home laboratory, then in Bowerchalke, Wiltshire, consisted of an ordinary kitchen Kilner jar and home-made lid with teflon to seal in a section of palladium silver alloy tube, along which hydrogen gas passed before it was removed via a valve on the left. The tube was heated to around 200°C to separate the different chemical components carried in the hydrogen gas, doing away with heavy pumps.,He demonstrated the device to ‘rocket scientists’ in Pasadena but at one point the flow of hydrogen stopped, and a sceptical engineer remarked that the tube must be blocked.,It turned out that the tube was not blocked, the separator did indeed work and, when Lovelock proved this, the gaggle of Nasa scientists and engineers around him ‘gave a great cheer…here’s something that really works and does magic’, Lovelock
recalls in his interview.,It was while working at NASA that Lovelock began to consider whether life could be detected on a planet simply by examining the planet’s atmosphere. He realised that the atmosphere would be pushed out of equilibrium by gases produced by living processes, such as methane and oxygen.,Whatever kind of biochemistry extra-terrestrial organisms turn out to be based upon, Lovelock realised that chemical equilibrium is tantamount to death and any sort of chemical disequilibrium could be regarded as a tell-tale signal of life.,This powerful idea marked a step towards Lovelock’s Gaia hypothesis – where Earth is described as a self-regulating system – which provided an intellectual framework for understanding the only planet known to harbour life.,Anyone investigating the history of the search for life on Mars might wonder why the Americans chose an almost unknown English scientist rather than a Nobel Prize-winning American, but he says it turned out his choice of the palladium separator was vital to the success of the Viking Project.,Lovelock’s work on the detector came to fruition in Pasadena in July 1976, when Viking Mars team members sat around a computer monitor, tensely awaiting the first data.,Carbon dioxide was released when organic compounds were added to Martian soil, which was thought to be a life signature. However, the instrument based on Lovelock’s work showed no evidence of life—and not only that but no evidence of organics.,Even though Lovelock remains convinced that Mars is a dead world, the Viking results
have long been debated
and, given the ability of microorganisms – extremophiles –
to thrive in extreme environments on Earth
, many scientists still believe life might have once lived on Mars and may even linger there today.,Lovelock has a long association with the Science Museum, which he first visited at the age of six and
now looks after his archive
. His passion for science was inspired by his childhood
love of steam engines
, notably the one developed by the blacksmith Thomas Newcomen and the Flying Scotsman. He once said that
he found learning in the museum was far more useful than in the classroom

How did it die? What material is it wrapped in? Are there amulets we can’t see inside? Is it an animal at all – could they be human remains?,To answer question like these and more, the Science Museum is collaborating in a new nationwide project analysing the remains of ancient Egyptian animals. Led by researchers at the
KNH Centre for Biomedical Egyptology
, the Ancient Egyptian Animal Biobank project is aiming to scan, sample and study all such remains in the UK.,Ancient Egyptians
appear to be the only civilisation to have deliberately mummified and preserved animals. Yet, relatively little is known about their motivations to do so (for some theories visit this
British Museum
site).,The study should produce valuable information about the role of animals in ancient Egypt – a critical part of the human story there.  Egypt was (and is) an agricultural society. Studying these animals will shed light on the food supplies and environment ancient Egyptians lived in, as well as the diseases that may have affected both animals and humans.,It’s a great opportunity for the Science Museum to get to know more about these objects. Part of the collections amassed by
Henry Wellcome
in the early 20th century, we know relatively little about where and when in Egypt they come from. Participating in this project will give us a better insight into how complete the remains are, whether there are other items inside we cant see, cause of death –  and a better idea of the time period and regions they’re from. Moreover – knowing more about their materials will help us care for them better in the future.,Next steps will be bringing the animals up to a Manchester hospital for
x-ray
and
CT scanning
later in the year. With scanners focussed on patients for most of the week – imaging has to be carried out on the weekend by
radiographers
willing to donate their free time to do this.,Samples of the various remains will also be collected for
testing
. We don’t damage the animals on purpose to do this – often small fragments flake off whilst they sit in the showcase. We can gather these up and send them to the biobank for analysis.,You can visit our collection of mummified animals in the

Knowing who owned an item, to me, entirely changes how I look at it.,But why collect this item, a pen from a Mr. Alfred Chune Fletcher?
Mr. Fletcher
(1865-1913) was a member of the
Royal College of Surgeons of England
and a Senior House Surgeon at St Bartholemew’s Hospital. Pens like this are often everyday tools of doctors, capturing their normal working lives rather than landmarks in the history of medicine.,Laboratory books have also been a common theme in the collections, especially when they detail important discoveries.,These laboratory books detail the experiments for the discovery of  a monoclonal antibody to Factor IX. Monoclonal antibodies are identical antibodies cloned from a single cell. Factor IX is one of the factors involved in blood clotting. Its absence causes a type of haemophilia.,In the electronic age should we be collecting email correspondence and scientists’ hard drives to represent the working lives of doctors and scientists?

Few animals have attained such universal levels of loathing, although more than one friend of mine has enjoyed keeping

aphrodisiacs

heart-shaped vegetables

not
to give the love of your life on VD day…,1. Cosmetic Enhancement.,Breast
pads to enhance cleavage, cork discs to plump out hollow cheeks, and a multitude of beauty spots to hide
smallpox
scars – whilst this cosmetic kit might have gone down a storm in the 1700s, as a surprise Valentine’s gift today it might leave your beau wondering why you’re focusing on their flaws just a tad too much.,To be fair – cosmetic enhancement isn’t always unromantic. Some people (and not even in the distant past!) would give their loved ones the gift of new
dentures
– which meant having all your teeth removed first. Ahhh there’s nothing that says “I love you” like serious dental work.,2.  A Chastity Belt.,Hmm me’thinks in this day and age a chastity belt screams trust issues. Whilst seemingly medieval – the majority of chastity belts and the stories that surround them appear to be the product of over-active 19th Century imaginations. So whilst your intention may be to present this padlocked token of love to your chosen lady to help her demonstrate her devotion – it’ll  definitely leave her thinking that you’re stuck in the Dark Ages.,3. Gonorrhoea Pants.,Whilst lingerie is usually the order on Valentine’s Day, this lacy little number probably won’t help you get into someone’s knickers. (Still – they could prove handy if you need to pass on a not so subtle message about what you inadvertently
picked up
there…).,4. A Heart Resuscitator.,A
heart-felt
gift (groan!) of one of these would sure cause a
shock
(bigger groan!). That is assuming you don’t need an

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/living-medical-traditions/,Science Museum,Living Medical Traditions,,Exhibitions and Galleries,medicine,"Our fifth floor gallery,
The Science and Art of Medicine
, touches on issues as emotive as abortion and third world health – so it is no surprise that it has been the subject of comment over the years.,A recent
blog post
and subsequent comments on
Twitter
have breathed life into an old debate about the presence of content relating to living medical traditions in the gallery.,First some basic scene setting for those who haven’t visited the gallery – it is made up of three sections – 2 large areas called Modern Medicine and Before Modern Medicine and a smaller area called Living Medical Traditions which was updated in 2006. Within this section there is a small area devoted to ‘Personal Stories’ which show how people choose to use medical treatments from different traditions.,On this subject we have an official statement from the Museum:,In our ‘Living Medical Traditions’ section of the
Science and Art of Medicine Gallery
we take an anthropological and sociological perspective on medical practices. We reflect patient experience in a global setting. We do not evaluate different medical systems, but demonstrate the diversity of medical practices and theoretical frameworks currently thriving across the world.,Our message in this display is that these traditions are not ‘alternative’ systems in most parts of the world. Instead they currently offer the majority of the global population their predominant, sometimes only, choice of medical care. We do not make any claims for the validity of the traditions we present. For example, we include the use of acupuncture but do not say that acupuncture ‘works’. We consider that these ‘alternative’ medical practices are of considerable cultural significance. We also recognise that some may consider the inclusion of these practices in the Science Museum controversial.,As with all Science Museum galleries independent experts were consulted when developing this gallery. In this instance advice was sought from leading academics in the history of non-western medical traditions as well as practitioners and users of these traditions. We maintained editorial control throughout and resisted equating local medical practices with the western medical tradition.,And now some comments from a curator who worked on the exhibit:,In the Personal Stories section of ‘Living Medical Traditions’ we chose to present the patient / practitioner perspective and describe their experiences. With this approach, we felt it would be clear that it was the patients and practitioners who had confidence in the efficacy of these other traditions, rather than the Science Museum. We certainly did not feel that by displaying such things in the Museum we were endorsing them. For example, another controversial exhibit – the Euthanasia Machine – is on display on our ground floor, but by displaying it we are not advocating assisted suicide. We appreciate that our visitors will have their own views.,In the same way that the gallery presents the medicine that the Ancient Egyptians, Romans, Renaissance physicians and so on and so on believed in and practised, we are doing a similar thing for TCM, Ayurveda etc which happen to still be practised today.,On the specific subject of homeopathy, we felt that the approach was very careful in explaining that the belief was with the users, but not us.,There’s a snapshot of the display
here
.,One final, rather cheeky point – critics of homeopathy are keen to point out that ‘Anecdotes are not data’. Quite right – and on that note we’d would love to encourage people who haven’t actually visited the gallery to come and see it for themselves. It’s free and if it stimulates this kind of debate then it can’t be all bad…"

Nikolaos the Wonderworker –

And yet, there are actually quite a few that are. Especially in the more eclectic corners of the medical collections. Here’s a selection of some our more unusual… forks!,This first one’s a bit of a cheat really. It’s a combined knife and fork developed for
Sir Richard Grindall
(1751-1820), a Vice-Admiral in the British Navy.,Grindall lost his arm in a military action in 1795 and subsequently used this type of combined cutlery. Curiously, his more famous seafaring contemporary
Admiral Nelson
used a similar device after losing his arm a couple of years after Grindall. Designs of his so-called
Nelson knife
are still available today.,Our second fork builds on this theme. When attached to the palm of this artificial arm it can be used in the conventional way and then removed at the end of the meal.,Take a close look at this final group of forks. The design seems to wilfully compromise its very purpose as the prongs are almost too short to be of use. But they are poignant reminders of a hidden past.,These unusual forks were provided at mealtimes for inmates of a
‘lunatic asylum’
at the turn of the 19
th
century. The intention being that any potential harm to self, or others, would be limited by the shortness of the prongs."

Louis XVI

Place de la Concorde
(re-named Place de la Révolution at the time). Here, in front of a crowd of many thousands, the ex-king was beheaded.,Although death at the hands of your people is about as low as it gets for a monarch, at least his departure was relatively swift. For just 9 months earlier the
guillotine
had been introduced to France. Previously, a king would probably have had his head removed with either a sword or axe – a messy business, even in experienced hands.,The development of this more reliable piece of execution technology had been instigated by
Joseph Ignace Guillotin
and fellow doctor,
Antoine Louis
. Not that it was the first
automated method
of decapitation. The
Halifax Gibbet
being one machine that preceded the guillotine by several centuries.,Ironically, given the guillotine’s role in the
Reign of Terror
that began in earnest later in 1793, Guillotin had seen it as a humane alternative to less reliable methods. As a fast-acting execution machine that wouldn’t fail and a step along the way to the end of the death penalty – a sentence that Guillotin actually opposed. As it was, the guillotine remained France’s official method of execution until capital punishment was
abolished in 1981
.,Nine months after Louis, his wife
Marie Antoinette

outbreak in Haiti is
spreading rapidly
and seems certain to result in many tens of thousands of cases. So far, more than 1,400 people have died since the first cases were confirmed in October. This ongoing situation is a tragic modern-day reminder of the deadly power of this disease – a disease which in Britain is historically associated with the overcrowded slums and poor sanitation of
Victorian
towns and cities.,Cholera provided a
deadly backdrop
to life in Victorian Britain and it was responsible for the
deaths of many
thousands over the century – mainly during the four major epidemics of 1832-3, 1848-9, 1853-4 and 1866. While it killed far less than some other diseases of the period, such as influenza and tuberculosis, the rapid onset of symptoms and their violent, transformative impact on the body meant that it was feared more than most.,Left untreated, the disease was nearly always fatal. It wasn’t known how it was
transmitted
and there was little in the way of effective treatment available during the British outbreaks of the 1800s. Not that there weren’t claims to the contrary made by some practitioners and makers of
quack medicines
.Their treatments varied from purging, bleeding and administering strong opiate drugs, to homeopathy and use of charms and amulets. One thing that could have helped – the rapid rehydration of the body – was not part of such offerings.,Today, cholera is relatively easy to treat and outbreaks are preventable through following basic levels of hygiene. There is also an effective
vaccine
. But new cases must be treated quickly as it can be fatal within hours of the first symptoms.

things
. Many of which we barely notice. They’re always just there. Lampposts, telephones, pens, kettles, books… They may change in appearance, but certain stuff always seems to keep hanging around. Until, those times you realise that you can’t recall the last time you actually saw one of these ubiquitous items.
Typewriters
anyone?,I’m fascinated by how objects make that transition from commonplace and everyday to banishment, and the ranks of the ‘disappeared’. Fashions change and technological advances are a big factor, but sometimes other forces are at play.,Examples of these lost objects are often revealed in old photographs.,I recently noticed this photograph on our

spittoon
.,Such receptacles were once common to many public areas in Britain – although their presence was comparatively low key compared to America. There, with
chewing tobacco
a popular habit, spitting in public remained more socially acceptable. Photographs from the 19
th
and early 20
th
century can reveal spittoons in many US social settings, from the
office
to the
bank
, the
courtroom
to the
barbershop
.,Increasingly regarded as a vulgar practice, spittoons became the only really acceptable outlet for public saliva. They discouraged random spitting and partly contained a major public health hazard – once sputum was linked to the
transmission of tuberculosis
in the 1880s.,But the days of these once omnipresent trip hazards were numbered. In many countries, health officials increasingly discouraged or banned their provision, while encouraging the use of personal spittoons. And while they remained more commonplace in US, the
1918 Flu pandemic
, the popularity of cigarettes and changing social mores all contributed to the decline there too.,Not that this is a total, global vanishing. For example, public spittoons can still be found in China, while in India, the many
gutkha
chewers use spittoons – albeit most of them improvised. But unless they’re hosting a

A lump could be chipped off when you fancied a brew. Finely ground then forced into block moulds,

included the Easter-time distribution of food to the local poor. These gifts eventually included the cakes stamped with their likeness which remain popular tourist souvenirs today.,This biscuit was also a souvenir – but one with unfortunate associations. It belonged to a member of an ill-fated
Arctic Expedition of 1875
, commanded by
George Nares
. The venture was cut short by
scurvy
, from which several crewmen died. Such biscuits (aka
‘hard tack’
) are symbolic of the impoverished ship’s diet that precipitated the illness. And yet, ironically,
this expedition
had a good supply of lime juice, but it had been rendered useless by distilling it in copper vessels, thereby destroying the vitamin C.,The biscuit is stamped with a ‘D’, perhaps indicating it was from the lead ship

Now, this was in fact the standard bit of kit for cutting stone – you chiselled a groove where you wanted to cut, poured emery dust or some other abrasive material into the crack, and then used the saw to make the final cut.,As one of James Watt’s final inventions was a method of copying sculpture, which involved cutting the copies out of blanks, the saw must have been used for producing the little ingots to go in his copying machines.,So the saw makes sense of some other mysteries – like the presence of lots of powdered emery and those rather impressive busts."

Out of date before it was in proper use, the Science Museum’s Rabbit Phone is virtually unused.,Today telepoint’s legacy lives on, echoed in the wifi internet networks we now have in trains, cafes and bars.,As this recent article in

Seemingly random, modest artifacts that you could imagine he saw, then pocketed – later to be catalogued alongside far more precious and valuable objects.,The lichen is recorded as being picked up by Sir Henry on a trip to
Stonehenge
in 1890. A note by the cataloguer suggests it was originally kept in a matchbox. We don’t know what happened to that.,These simple bronze objects are stored amongst hundreds of similar Roman implements. But these six appear to be the only ones that Wellcome himself picked up from an archaeological site.,Archaeology was one of Henry’s passions and between 1911 and 1914 he funded
major excavations
at
Jebel Moya
, in Sudan. Here, he pioneered the use of
aerial photography
to view archaeological features and also found time to personally dig up the bone beads shown above which once formed a necklace.,There is one final, rather poignant contribution by Wellcome to his own collections.

– a UK charity for people with eating disorders – to get hold of a copy of the Order of Service.,Eating disorders such as
Anorexia Nervosa
and
Bulimia Nervosa
are such prevalent mental health problems – affecting 1.6 million people in the UK alone – yet such experiences are barely documented through material culture at all.,Part of the problem is that there might not be any objects to collect. Can we document mental health experiences (depression for example) when they seemingly aren’t embodied in objects or expressed through stuff?,Why collect objects to represent such illnesses anyway?,With an anthropological hat on, documenting experiences and reactions to eating disorders reveals a lot about us as a society –  the significance of food and health, perceptions of beauty, and how our bodies respond to stress.,Historically, how societies have treated self-starvation is fascinating.
Apollonia Schreier
, a German woman, was credited with almost mystical abilities after refusing food for 11 months.,Of course we can’t treat such experiences as ‘Anorexia’ – the condition didn’t medically exist until the late nineteenth century. But by documenting historical and contemporary experiences through material culture, we can perhaps understand a little better why we treat illnesses today as we do.,Perhaps not all human experiences can be told through objects. Yet, I’d argue that material culture has a unique ability to connect you to stories and experiences even at a glance – so I think it’s worth a bit of lateral thinking.,Anyway, here’s a few other objects we could collect on the topic: size zero clothing, the personal effects of an individual who’s experienced an eating disorder (perhaps their weighing scale or diary for instance), self-help manuals, health education material etc. Other thoughts, suggestions or insights most welcome."
https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/james-watt-r-i-p/,Jane Insley,"James Watt, RIP",,"Collections and Objects,Exhibitions and Galleries","art,engineering,james watt's workshop","James Watt died 191 years ago today. He was considered one of the most
important engineer
s in the country, and after his death he was turned into a national hero. The result was a slew of statues, memorials and paintings – some of which will go on show in a new exhibition opening in spring 2011. More details to follow…,When Watt was 59, his friend and partner Matthew Boulton introduced him to Carl von Breda, who painted the earliest portrait that that Watt was known to sit for. At the time, 1792, he was fighting to save their steam engine business from legal challenges, but was wealthy enough to have built his house Heathfield near Birmingham to suit his growing family.,By 1815, he was more relaxed, and more prepared to have his portrait painted. This one, by Thomas Lawrence, was much liked by the artist, who thought it was the finest he had ever painted, but the family – James Watt, and his eldest son James Watt Jnr – didn’t really care for it.,Another highly regarded artist, Sir Francis Chantrey, produced a marble bust for the Royal Academy exhibition in 1815. Watt was swathed in a toga-like cloak as a 19th century conceit to show he was a true philosopher.,The bust was much copied, and even Watt had a go, using the bust to test his sculpture-copying machines. He wrote to a friend “I do not think myself of importance enough to fill up so much of my friends’ houses as the original bust does”.,This was painted after Watt’s death, but he is shown as a young man studying a mal-functioning model of a Newcomen steam engine. The challenge of trying to get it to work put Watt on the road to perfecting full-size engines.,Bizarrely there was even a
Japanese woodcut
, prepared in the 1880s for primary school children, showing him testing the steam from a boiling kettle in his aunt’s house."

Cosmonauts: Birth of the Space Age
,
supported by BP
.,Tickets are now on sale
for the exhibition, which opens on 18 September 2015 and will feature the greatest collection of Soviet spacecraft and artefacts ever assembled in once place, including eight that had to be declassified for this project, to provide a vivid insight into how the Soviet Union kick-started the space age.,Speaking at a
news conference
this morning at the Science Museum, Leonov told journalists he was convinced the Soviets could also have beaten the U.S. to the first manned orbit of the moon but for the conservatism of those running their highly secretive moon programme following the death in 1966 of Sergei Korolev, the lead rocket engineer and spacecraft designer on the Russian Space Programme.,Leonov told the audience that he and Yuri Gagarin argued for pressing ahead with the manned orbit but were overruled: “Both Yuri and myself went to the Politburo and asked that we go ahead. But our bureaucrats said it was too risky so let us try a sixth (unmanned) probe. And of course it landed a few hundred metres from where it was supposed to….so unfortunately it didn’t work out for me.”,Cosmonauts: Birth of the Space Age
will include the monumental five metre tall LK-3 lunar lander that Leonov trained on in Star City. Designed to take a single cosmonaut to the moon, three Soviet lunar landers were tested successfully in space although none ever touched down on the surface of the moon.,Ian Blatchford spoke of the honour of having Alexei Leonov alongside him (see Leonov’s dramatic account of his battle to reenter the spacecraft
here
) as he announced the “most audacious and complex exhibition in the history of the Science Museum and indeed one of the most ambitious projects ever presented by any great museum”.,He then invited journalists to see the first of 150 objects to arrive from Russia –  including Vostok-6, the capsule that carried
Valentina Tereshkova
, the first woman to travel into space, and safely returned her to Earth in 1963.,The Science Museum Director described how the exhibition will explore a critical moment in the history of humankind, when people first set forth beyond the confines of their home world: “the Russian space programme is one of the great cultural, scientific and engineering achievements of the 20th century.”,Cosmonauts
, which has drawn on the help and support of the first generation of Soviet space pioneers, will explore the science and technology of Russian space travel in its cultural and spiritual context, revealing a deep-rooted national yearning for space that was shaped by the turbulent early decades of the 20
th
century. The exhibition will feature rocket pioneer
Konstantin Tsiolkovsky’s
extraordinary 1933 drawings of space flight, depicting spacewalks, weightlessness and life in orbit almost thirty years before it became a reality.,Ian Blatchford also thanked all the cosmonauts, partners and funders who have made this exhibition possible.
Cosmonauts
represents a major collaboration between the Science Museum, the State Museum Exhibition Centre ROSIZO, the Memorial Museum of Cosmonautics and the Federal Space Agency, Roscosmos. The support of many other institutions and individuals in the UK and Russia has also been crucial in the development of the exhibition.,The exhibition opens on 18 September 2015 and will run until 13 March 2016 at the Science Museum in London. The Museum will be open until 10pm every Friday evening during this period to allow visitors more opportunities to see the exhibition.,Cosmonauts: Birth of the Space Age

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/science-museum-group-academy-off-to-a-flying-start/,Roger Highfield,Science Museum Group Academy: Off to a Flying Start,"A pioneering STEM learning initiative has exceeded all our expectations during its first year, reports Roger Highfield, Science Director.","At the Museum,Education","Education,Science capital,Science Museum education,Science Museum Group Academy,stem,The Academy","When we set up the
Academy
, the UK’s first dedicated centre of excellence for informal STEM education, we believed that informal learning had the power to change the world.,‘A year later, we are pleased to report that the initiative has far exceeded our expectations,’ said Susan Raikes, group Director of Learning. ‘We wanted to give STEM practitioners of all kinds the tools to reach a bigger audience more effectively and, from what we have learned from the feedback, that’s precisely what has happened, with more people attending than we expected: almost 1400 teachers, museum and STEM professionals.’,The knock-on effects will already be substantial, given that the 344 primary teachers and 166 secondary teachers from the UK alone have the potential to reach more than 50,000 students, and that there were another 200 teachers from Italy and Hong Kong.,The participants gave us hugely encouraging feedback. One teacher declared their Academy course was ‘a wonderful way to get you out of the classroom, thinking about ways to engage and inspire learners.’ A second added: ‘It was one of the best courses I attended in 20 years of teaching.’,Another sign of its growing influence is that the Academy team has been invited to deliver keynote presentations at the Nordic Science Centre Association and the Spanish Science and Technology Museums and Centres annual conferences.,In its first year, the Academy team has tripled in size, with sites in the
Science and Industry Museum, Manchester
as well as in the Science Museum London, which led the way in informal learning in 1931 with its pioneering Children’s Gallery, where our youngest visitors – including Princess Elizabeth (now HM The Queen) and David Attenborough – could turn handles, press buttons and pull levers.,‘Today, the Science Museum is working as hard as ever to promote informal learning in concert with the four sister museums in our group, which are visited by more than 600,000 children each year in booked educational visits, and millions more visiting with their families’, said Susan Raikes.,To complement other excellent efforts in the educational ecosystem, the Academy works closely with the UK Association for Science and Discovery Centres, notably on the
Science Capital in Practice project
, Greater Manchester Combined Authority, STEM Learning, and others.,The Academy’s
first courses
were designed to help participants to make personal connections with science, both in school and in their everyday lives.,For example, one activity is called Powerful Questions, which encourages teachers to generate questions or statements that link students’ interests and experiences with science concepts. Many powerful examples emerged in the first crop of courses:,How would you save Love Island from flooding?,Computers make better grime music than Stormzy.,What would a
T-Rex
or an
Apatosaurus
order from McDonalds?,One teacher commented on how their Academy experience had been ‘supportive and not intimidating’, while another said how great it was that our resources use ‘everyday materials and equipment which made them cheap and easy to put into practice.’ Perhaps the most rewarding comment came from the teacher who remarked that the experience ‘reminded me why we teach children science.’,,Beth Hawkins, Academy manager, added: ‘From 473 feedback forms received, 100% of participants rated the courses ‘very good’ or ‘good’, while teachers agreed or strongly agreed that the course was valuable for their professional development.’,At the
Academy’s launch a year ago in the Science Museum
, the serious purpose of the endeavour was underlined by Peter Mather, Group Regional President, Europe and Head of Country, UK, of BP, the Academy’s founding partner: ‘To equip the next generation with the right skills in science, technology, in engineering and in maths, they need to be exposed to the highest levels of teaching, of expertise, of enthusiasm for science.’,The work of the Academy rests on the sturdy foundations of an earlier programme, Enterprising Science – a five-year partnership between the Group, King’s College London, University College London, and BP that focused on science capital – a measure of how people’s relationship with science can be deepened through formal and informal experiences.

here.,At the launch, the Government’s then Science Minister talked of the importance of creating ‘the Rosalind Franklins, Alan Turings and Stephen Hawkings of the future’ while Andria Zafirakou, 2018 Global Teacher Prize winner, told the VIPs and dignitaries present that she was ‘really impressed’ with the quality of the Academy’s resources.,One of those who has since attended the Academy is Peter Tabichi, the Kenyan teacher who was named the
Varkey Foundation Global Teacher Prize 2019
at a ceremony in March hosted by actor, singer, and producer Hugh Jackman.,He took part in a session with UK teachers this month and remarked:,‘As a science teacher in Africa who firmly believes in STEM education as one of the most important tools for equipping future generations to tackle the great challenges of the world, we can only do this effectively by working together. I was delighted to spend quality time with the Science Museum Group Academy.,I enjoyed a great conversation and a truly constructive exchange of ideas with teachers and I think we all learned a lot from one another.,Museums, with their incredible treasure trove of historic artefacts and real-life working apparatus, have the power to enchant, entertain and inspire. When I visited the Science Museum, the home of British science, I was overcome by wonder at the scale and scope of the exhibits. What’s more, I could see the look of wonder in the eyes of so many children who were also touring the exhibits that day.’,Susan Raikes concluded: ‘Our interactive Wonderlab galleries in
London
and
Bradford
, our enthusiastic Explainers, our work with schools, festivals and our events exploring both historic and leading-edge science help keep us at the forefront of science education and communication. By constantly innovating, we are using the history, present, and future of science, technology, medicine, transport, and media to inspire the next generation, and to help build a scientifically literate society.’,Find out more

Starmus Festival
, Leonov was introduced to a celebrity-laden audience in the museum’s IMAX theatre by Director, Ian Blatchford. Earlier that same day Blatchford and Leonov had sat in front of a reproduction of Leonov’s painting of his
pioneering spacewalk
to announce the most ambitious exhibition in the history of the Museum,
Cosmonauts: Birth of the Space Age
, supported by BP, when many Soviet spacecraft will be gathered together for the first time.,As Mr Blatchford thanked the twice-hero of the Soviet Union, whose character is every bit as bold as his space feats, Sputnik 3, Soyuz and a Lunokhod 2 rover were being
lifted through the museum
into their temporary home on the first floor. Vostok 6 and Voskhod 1 had arrived the day before, the first wave of around 150 iconic objects that hail from the dawn of space exploration.,Leonov began by recounting Nazi Germany’s attempt ‘to destroy London’ in the Second World War, when modern rocketry was launched with the
V-2
, the first long-range guided ballistic missile. When the Russian Army entered Peenemünde, among them an expert group including Sergei Korolev, who would come to be known as ‘The Chief Designer’ in the Soviet Union), the Germans had left only 10 minutes earlier. ‘The coffee was still warm’, said Leonov.,The German rocketeers who had already fled included Wernher von Braun, who would become the father of the US
Apollo moon programme
, and had by then surrendered to the Americans in Austria. Von Braun had wanted to defect to the Americans but later told Leonov that he would have worked for the Soviets too, claiming he wanted to use rocketry for exploration, not murder. ‘He was very sincere, very frank,’ said Leonov, ‘though you may chose not to believe his words because these were weapons, after all.’,The USSR captured a number of
V-2s
, including one from the marshes of Peenemünde, and German staff. This paved the way for the manufacture of a Soviet duplicate, the R-1. By August 1957, a descendant, the R-7, was capable of launching a satellite into orbit.,The space age dawned with the launch of Sputnik 1, which was ‘just a sphere with a transmitter…beep beep, beep beep,’ said Leonov. ‘That was sufficient for people to get very excited, now we are in an era where there is an artificial object floating in space. This was only the beginning.’,The Soviet Union followed Sputnik by launching the first animal, man and woman into orbit in just six years, feats that will be recorded by the Science Museum’s
Cosmonauts exhibition
with objects ranging from a
dog ejector seat
from a sub-orbital rocket to a model of Vostok 1 (Russian for ‘East’), which carried Yuri Gagarin into space, and Valentina Tereshkova’s Vostok-6 descent module.,After chalking the outline of a Vostok, Leonov moved on to the Voskhod (Russian for “sunrise”), which he said was part of a lunar programme that began with a directive in 1962 and was officially sanctioned by the Politburo two years later.,Voskhod 1 launched on October 12, 1964. Even though there was not enough room to wear space suits, or time to develop a launch escape system, it successfully took the first three-man crew into orbit years before the US Apollo’s three-man crews.,Voskhod 2 featured more powerful propulsion, TV and had been adapted to allow Leonov to carry out the first ever spacewalk. The spacecraft carried a ‘genius invention’, he said, an airlock that could be inflated through which a cosmonaut could step into open space. ‘That was me,’ said Leonov.,Earlier, Korolev had told him, ‘as a sailor should know how to swim in open ocean, so a cosmonaut should be able to swim in space.’,But Leonov’s ill-fated mission almost did not take place. An earlier automated unmanned test flight – Voskhod 3KD – had been destroyed after ground controllers sent a sequence of commands that accidentally set off a self-destruct mechanism designed to prevent the craft ending up in enemy hands.,At a meeting in a hotel, Korolev told Leonov he hoped to adapt his Voskhod 2 to complete the unmanned mission to test the airlock and spacesuit. ‘We were set dead against it,’ said Leonov. He protested to The Chief Designer: ‘We have personally worked through 3000 emergency scenarios’, which was greeted, understandably, with scepticism. ‘Yeah, of course you did,’ said Korolev. ‘You are sure to come across the three thousand and first. And, of course, Leonov ‘would know what to do.’,Leonov admitted to the audience that Korolev’s cynicism was well placed. To carry out his spacewalk above the Black Sea, on 18 March 1965, he and his crewmate Pavel Belyayev came across the ‘three thousandth and second and third and fifth and sixth…all of them were not described in any instructions before.’,As Leonov ‘stepped into the abyss’, he was struck by the sound of his own breathing, his heartbeat and a sense of the universe ‘being limitless in time and space’. Given that in the darkness the temperatures plunged to minus 140 deg C and in sunlight rose to 150 deg C his suit was ‘a stroke of genius’ for the way it kept him at a comfortable 20 deg C.,But eight minutes into the spacewalk, he felt that his gloves had expanded so much that he could no longer feel them with his fingers any more. His legs started to shake. Leonov’s spacesuit had by now ballooned in space to an alarming degree. ‘I started feverishly thinking of what I was going to do to re-enter the spacecraft’.,First he had to coil his tether. Every 50 cm dangled a 2.5 cm diameter ring, which he was supposed to hook.’ But he had ‘no support’ and was hanging on by one hand. ‘It was very hard.’,He disobeyed the orders of Korolev – there was no time to wait for a committee to be assembled to deliberate on his predicament – and opened a valve to bleed of some of the suit’s pressure, risking the bends by lowering the pressure beyond the safety limit.,On his back Leonov wore ‘metal tanks with ninety minutes’ worth of oxygen’  but it was clear from his talk that he remained concerned he had not left enough time for the nitrogen from the oxygen/nitrogen mix inside Voskhod to be purged from his blood. ‘There was a danger of nitrogen boiling in my blood and I was feeling this needling sensation in my fingers but I had no choice.’ Fortunately, ‘The feeling went away.’,Instead of entering legs first, as he had trained to do, Leonov went in head first, requiring ‘an awful amount of energy’ to turn around in the confines of the 1.2 m diameter airlock (he measured 1.9 m in his spacesuit). His core body temperature soared by 1.8 °C as he contorted himself. ‘That was the most stressful moment.’ Overall, the spacewalk lasted 12 minutes. By that time, Soviet state radio and television had stopped their live broadcasts.,The mission’s problems were far from over. The descent module’s hatch failed to reseal properly, leading to a slow leak. The craft’s automated systems flooded the craft with oxygen, raising the risk of fire of the kind seen in the
Apollo 1 tragedy
.,When they turned on their automatic descent systems, the spacecraft did not stop rotating. ‘It was difficult and dangerous to stop.’ Their automatic guidance system had malfunctioned. They asked Korolev for permission to conduct a manual descent, which the craft was not designed to do. ‘It was very similar to driving a car looking out the window from the side.’ From an ‘ancient Soviet radio station’ in Antarctica came permission, along with a note of caution: ‘Be careful.’,‘You know what, let us land in the Red Square, it would be so jolly funny,’ remarked Leonov, who was the mission navigator. Belyayev, commander, replied that they would ‘clip all the stars in the Kremlin so I don’t think we should do it’. Eventually, Voskhod 2 ended up far from the primary landing zone on the steppes of Kazakhstan, in polar forests – taiga – around 180 kilometres from Perm in Siberia. ‘To us, the trees of 30-40 m looked like a manicured lawn.’ Leonov transmitted a call sign with a manual telegraph system – ‘everything is in order’ – but it was greeted by silence.,A gust of cold air entered when they opened the hatch. Belyayev jumped out and ended up neck deep in snow. Leonov was sloshing around knee deep in water in his spacesuit. They stripped in the cold and Leonov wrung out his underwear. ‘Can you imagine this picture – a spacecraft, the taiga, and naked chaps standing next to each other?’,The next day, ‘comrades on skis’ arrived and, after another night and a nine kilometre ski trip, they were picked up by helicopter.,The Soviets had originally planned to orbit the moon in 1967 and had two parallel lunar programmes, one manned and one unmanned (This was a mistake, Leonov conceded). On his blackboard, Leonov drew a Soyuz (Russian for ‘Union’) 7K-L1 ‘Zond’ (‘probe’) spacecraft that was designed to circle the Moon and described how he had even studied the sky in Somalia to decide which stars to use for lunar navigation. ‘Everything was ready.’,Leonov was once the Soviet cosmonaut thought most likely to become the first human on the Moon. But the Soviet lunar programme was starved of resources compared with America’s Apollo programme, the Soviet manned moon-flyby missions lost political momentum and Korolev died in 1966 (‘those who took his place decided this was too risky’). One could sense his frustration when he declared: ‘Six spacecraft orbited the moon without a man on board.’,However, Science Museum visitors will be able to inspect the monumental five metre LK-3 lunar lander, the finest example of its kind, which was designed to take a single cosmonaut to the Moon’s surface.,Leonov counted himself lucky to be part of the Apollo Soyuz mission, when ‘the cold war could become a hot war at any moment.’ Conducted in July 1975, it was the first joint US–Soviet space flight, and the last flight of an Apollo spacecraft. The mission was a symbol of superpower détente. ‘Every day we spoke on Good Morning America,’ said Leonov. He groaned with mock horror, ‘awwww’, acting out the apoplexy of small-town America at the thought of a cosmonaut orbiting overhead.,Leonov went on to talk about how singer Sarah Brightman had cancelled her trip to the International Space Station, mention the Soviet
Buran
shuttle, which was delayed by discussions about pilots and automated control (the latter won but ‘we lost three years, launched only one and then nobody commissioned it’) and discussions to allow China to dock with the ISS.,He also discussed the greatest threat to humanity, that of asteroid impacts (now marked by
Asteroid Day
), which demanded the best of human ingenuity and technology in response. In 2008 the Association of Space Explorer’s Committee on Near-Earth Objects and its international Panel on Asteroid Threat Mitigation gave
recommendations
to the United Nations. ‘So far we have not heard back from them. I think they are waiting for the asteroid to hit them’.,Leonov had before him in the Science Museum IMAX an audience that ranged from amateur space enthusiasts to rock legends
Brian May
and
Rick Wakeman
, and the world’s best known scientist, Professor Stephen Hawking, who had recently given a highly publicised
tour of the Science Museum
. Leonov described him as ‘amazingly courageous’.,Sitting in the front row of the IMAX was the UK’s first astronaut,
Helen Sharman
, whose
Sokol space suit
will be shown in Cosmonauts. Leonov described how he had a ‘very moving’ reunion in the museum with ‘little Helen.’ ‘The best pupil I have ever had,’ said Leonov.,Sharman had been selected to travel into space on 25 November 1989 ahead of nearly 13,000 other applicants. She blasted off in 1991. Leonov encouraged her to stand, and the audience showed their appreciation with a round of applause. ‘She had a special energy, special intellect. You should be proud of this person.’,At the end of the event, Leonov was presented an honorary fellowship of the Science Museum by Hawking and the Chairman of the Board of Trustees, Dame Mary Archer. In return, Leonov, who had dined with Hawking earlier that day, presented the Cambridge cosmologist with a portrait he had sketched after lunch. ‘Stephen smiled, hooray,’ a delighted Leonov told the audience, who were also addressed by Alistair Scott, President of the British Interplanetary Society, and astronomer Garik Israelian of the Starmus Festival.,At a celebratory dinner in the museum that night, Leonov gave a speech in Russian (he preferred his mother tongue because, as he cheerfully recounted, he once ended a speech given in English by wishing his audience ‘sex for life’ rather than ‘a successful life.’) Leonov also alluded to the prevailing American bias in museum accounts of space history. He praised the Science Museum for containing the ‘wisdom of the world’ that would be an ‘inspiration and lesson for future generations.’,Roger Highfield, Director of External Affairs, spent a day with the pioneering cosmonaut for the launch of

The technique was fundamental to the discovery of the structure of many significant molecules, including DNA, penicillin, and insulin in the twentieth century.,“For the first-time textile designers have found their inspiration in a world that the eye cannot see, the world of the atom and the molecule. For the first time, their prompters have been the people of science.”,‘The Design Story of the Century’,
British Textiles
, April 1951,,Historians have spent much time researching the exhibitions at the Festival of Britain that saw a huge range of materials, ideas, designs, and concepts brought together at sites across the capital. The chemistry collection at the Science Museum contains a series of
textile design prints
that were commissioned by the Festival Pattern Group from patterns of X-ray crystallography, focusing on the work of Dr Helen Megaw.,Dr Helen Megaw
(1 Jun 1907 – 26 Feb 2002) was appointed to the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge in 1946 and focused her career on inorganic molecules. Pioneering efforts in the understanding of hydrogen bonding in metals, establishing structures for ice, Megaw also published the definitive text on
ferroelectrics
.,In 1946, Megaw wrote to Marcus Brumwell, director of the
Design Research Unit
, and suggested that the wallpaper and fabric designers at the Unit might be inspired by the patterns that ‘crop-up’ in her work. Megaw had been ‘impressed by the beauty of designs’ that came from attempts towards ‘clarity and accuracy’.,By 1951, Megaw was a consultant to the Festival Pattern Group and provided a series of crystal structure diagrams that were used in the designs for textiles, wallpaper, window glass, ashtrays, and a tea set used throughout the Festival. But the collaboration did not always go smoothly, differing creative processes of scientists and designers had to accommodate scientific legitimacy and artistic conventions simultaneously as they grappled with the question of how scientific knowledge of the newly emerging molecular world could, or should, be represented.,‘It is legitimate to show only those features of the map which one desires to emphasize for a given purpose; but it is not legitimate to change their positions. Or to put in things which are not there…’,Helen Megaw, Notes of the Crystal Structure Diagrams for the Festival Pattern Group, 12 Jan 1950.,Was it appropriate for the designers to move molecules at the cost of scientific accuracy? Why use the results of X-ray crystallographer’s work in the first place? Could the pattern retain the name of the molecule it was taken from, as the Festival Design Group intended? Did the design also lose something in the distortion of scientific truth?,All these questions continue today as scientists and artists collaborate and the Science Museum’s collection of science-inspired design objects from the Festival of Britain help us to inspire artists and scientists alike.,Full details of the textile design prints commissioned by the Festival Pattern Group from patterns from X-ray crystallography and held in the Science Museum collection can be

race is a social construct that has no biological meaning
, was the subject of a discussion at Lates last week in the Science Museum.,To analyse why dangerously divisive race science has seen a
re-emergence in recent times
, the link with the rise of nationalism, and other issues, the event was held in the museum’s IMAX during an adults-only
Lates
and MCed by journalist, writer, and broadcaster,
Samira Ahmed.,,Ahmed said: ‘It is an important time to read the history of why race science is resurgent, how it’s shaping public policy right now, how media coverage including of sport can be complicit, and how we can challenge it.’,,She was joined by authors of three influential books for what she called a ‘really important discussion’ to examine how questionable science has been used to misrepresent the abilities of different ethnic groups, notably when it comes to intelligence and sport.,,Angela Saini, author of
‘Superior: The Return of Race Science’
, has spent five years (through Superior and her previous book,
Inferior
) – debunking the idea that science is always objective and apolitical, calling for
more diversity in science
.,Ultimately, however, research is done by people with all their talents, prejudices and foibles and, in Superior, Saini examines the long history of the ‘toxic idea of race and racial hierarchy.’,Even today, she said, ‘this idea has not gone away.’,,Race was once considered when predicting how patients will respond to different medications, for instance, to treat hypertension, but genetic groupings (based on DNA analysis) are much
more informative regarding differences in drug metabolism than skin colour or self-defined ethnic groups
.,Moreover, the idea that sickle-cell anaemia is a “black disease”,  thalassemia a “Mediterranean disease” and cystic fibrosis a “white disease” are over-simplistic.,Research (for example, see
here
, and
here
) now links the incidence of chronic illnesses to racial discrimination rather than to racial differences, said Saini.,Derek Bardowell, author of
‘No Win Race: A Story of Belonging, Britishness and Sport’
,  uses sport as a prism to explore attitudes to race and racism, from the Brixton riots to Brexit, meditating on how social attitudes have evolved from when his father arrived in Britain, as part of the Windrush generation, to those of his own son.,However, ‘we’re still viewed as black, as in black as a threat, as outsiders, as aggressive,’ he said.,,Gavin Evans, lecturer at Birkbeck University, is the author of
‘Skin Deep: Journeys in the Divisive Science of Race’
, which examines the repetitive history of race science, based in part on his experience growing up under apartheid in South Africa.,Evans focused on attempts to link race and intelligence, despite how neither are precisely defined, with intelligence depending on
many genes
and on environmental factors.,IQ was born of eugenics, the idea that the ‘genetic quality’ of the population could be improved, commented Saini.,However, the extent to which the nuances of human cognitive ability can be captured by a single number – IQ –
is still debated

PTSD
) and at
Combat Stress
we provide treatment for veterans with PTSD and other mental health problems.,But the impact of conflict, not just physically but mentally, was less well understood during the First World War.,The  Science Museum’s new exhibition
Wounded,
which opens on 29 June 2016, gives a raw insight into the psychological impact of the First World War and draws parallels with the treatment provided to soldiers today.,Back then soldiers received little or no sympathy, with shell shock considered a sign of weakness or cowardice. If their mental health led to a failure to obey orders, death by firing squad was a real possibility. Tragically, 306 British and Commonwealth soldiers were executed during the war, many of whom were likely suffering from shell shock.,By the end of the First World War, British Army medics had seen 80,000 cases of shell shock, with 20,000 soldiers still struggling to come to terms with what they had witnessed. Society’s response was to indefinitely confine veterans to Mental War Hospitals under martial law. Many more were sent on, without appeal, to asylums.,In the face of such cruelty veterans chose to suffer in silence for fear of what might happen to them if they sought help. Despite this situation, a group of women bravely chose to take a stand and, in 1919, founded the Ex-Servicemen’s Welfare Society, which is now
Combat Stress
.,They had three simple aims – the relief of distress; the provision of employment; and access to professional medical assistance. These founding mothers believed work was essential to the men’s identity, as well as providing the veterans with financial security. The charity offered a variety of occupations including basket weaving and making Thermega electric blankets, which were sold around the world.,A great deal has changed since then.,Combat Stress now runs three treatment centres where we provide a range of free services to help veterans rebuild their lives, including a world-leading six-week PTSD Intensive Treatment Programme.,Six Afghanistan veterans who were treated by Combat Stress were invited by the Science Museum to create a very personal display for the
Wounded
exhibition, representing their trauma and drawing parallels with the soldiers of the First World War.,The men showed great courage in sharing their experiences with the Museum. I believe their display not only raises awareness of PTSD but also will lead to greater compassion and understanding of the impact war can have on the mental health of servicemen and women.,Wounded: Conflict, Casualties and Care

Open House London
and a continuation of the celebrations of the 150th anniversary of Dmitri Mendeleev’s periodic table.,Visitors to the Royal Society of Chemistry’s (RSC) base at Burlington House in Piccadilly, London, ​will be able to discover the history of this illustrious society, get hands-on with chemistry and enjoy activities with Science Museum’s curators who are seeking new chemistry objects to add to the national collection.,This annual event contributes to
ChemFest 2019
, the brainchild of
Dame Mary Archer
, Chair of SMG, to celebrate the International Year of the Periodic Table (
IYPT
), the grid-like arrangement of the elements that reveals a remarkable periodicity in their affairs, such as how they react with each other.,150 years ago, the table allowed Mendeleev to infer the existence of as yet undiscovered elements. Today, the grid is understood in terms of the behaviour in atoms of electrons, governed by quantum theory, and is very much a living thing helping chemists seek super-heavy elements and exotic chemistries in a vast, unknown landscape of possibilities.,To celebrate this most iconic of chemistry icons, ChemFest 2019 has seen an unprecedented collaboration between the Science Museum, RSC and others including the V&A, the Natural History Museum, The Royal Albert Hall, The Royal College of Art,
Imperial College London
and the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851.,To date, there have been over 30 events at the Science Museum and throughout South Kensington.,For the millions of people who are our online visitors, Associate Curator of Chemistry
Rupert Cole
has written Science Museum chemistry-themed blogs tackling topics from
the seaside
to
sun cream

Curies’ discovery of radium
, and, of course, a number on the

, we are releasing curated chemistry narratives showing off the Science Museum Group Collection, including video highlights. So far there have been stories on
alternative periodic tables
,

.,ChemFest
got off to what Dame Mary called ‘a flying start’ in early March when we unveiled a
celebratory display
which included an 1869 journal containing Mendeleev’s first published periodic table as well as a collection of elements that were amassed a few decades later by French politician and linguist Prince Louis Lucien Bonaparte. In one of the most prominent places in the museum, it has been seen by a significant proportion of the Science Museum’s 3.2 million annual visitors.,At the launch event, Dame Mary organised and chaired a panel discussion in the museum, including chemists Professor Emma Raven of the University of Bristol, Professor Elise Cartmell of Scottish Water, Professor Andrea Sella of UCL and Professor
Sir Martyn Poliakoff
of the University of Nottingham, who with his friend from St Andrews, David Cole-Hamilton, pushed for the IYPT to take place three years ago.,Their lively discussion ranged from the history of the periodic table to Sir Martin discussing a new periodic table based on the scarcity of elements, especially in relation to smartphone production.,To round off the celebrations, Andrew Smyth, aerospace engineer, and Great British Bake-off finalist, made periodic table cupcakes, one for each of the 118 chemical elements.,During ChemFest the Science Museum featured workshops and family shows which reached an audience of 12,565 adults and children. The 35 STEM professionals who took part also received audience engagement training from the Science Museum
Academy
, with invaluable support from the museum’s volunteers as well.,‘These workshops and shows were brilliantly popular and showed that chemistry is a cultural activity – we had a choir performance of a specially-commissioned piece on the periodic table sung by St Catharine’s College Girls’ Choir and Imperial College Choir’, Rupert recalled.,This choral piece, ‘Mendeleev’s Dream’ composed by Christopher Fox, was recorded and features on gallery alongside the periodic table display. It marks the 60th anniversary of
the most successful attempt to bring this feat of elemental accountancy to a wider audience with music: The Elements
song written in 1959 by Tom Lehrer.,﻿,Again, with the support of the Royal Society of Chemistry, we also ran two Easter family days, featuring performances by St Catharine’s Girls’ and Imperial choirs, and a show about the hidden world of atmospheric gases.  STEM professionals and volunteers achieved a total of 9597 encounters with adults and children (far in excess of the 4000 we had originally planned).,In neighbouring Imperial College, Dr. Peter Wothers gave an explosive demonstration lecture on the chemical elements to a packed family audience of around 400, and Rupert chaired a judging panel at the Salters’ Institute Festival of Chemistry, attended by 16 schools.,On the same day in April, there was a chemistry teacher event at the Science Museum in which the Royal Society of Chemistry showcased their school resources and activities as part of the
museum’s monthly adults-only Lates
, which was themed around all things chemical.,The audience of more than 3,000 people, mostly under the age of 30, could take part in activities such as ‘Elemental Guess Who?’, speed dating with a chemical twist and a Royal Society of Chemistry demonstration of the quantum magic behind fireworks, where colours can be understood in terms of electrons jumping between atomic orbitals.,,The
Lates
evening ran workshops, including an over-subscribed opportunity for people to make their own slime, the opportunity to vaporise elements with lasers, periodic table twister, and use of neon face paints to explore the chemistry of colour.,From April to mid-July, professional chemists joined the Explainers at the Chemistry Bar in the museum’s spectacular
Wonderlab interactive gallery
to tell stories about chemistry to the 35,000 or so visitors, mostly children, who pass through each month.,,ChemFest also saw an academic gathering over the 10 – 11 of April. On the first day, the Science Museum hosted ‘Chemistry in Albertopolis’, exploring the history of chemistry in South Kensington and beyond, which brought together eminent historians and chemists for what Dame Mary called a ‘metaphorical and literal tour of key chemical South Kensington venues.’,Among the discussions, delegates saw a remarkable picture of women chemists at Imperial College and artworks from their student magazine, including one of Martha Whiteley, who led the earliest studies of chemical weapons during the First World War and was a leading campaigner for equal rights for women in chemistry.,The conference concluded with a Director’s Lecture given by Sir Ian Blatchford on the Victorian chemist, Liberal politician and 1851 Commissioner Lyon Playfair, attended by 127 guests including Dr. Robert Parker, CEO of the RSC.  Delegates enjoyed a celebratory drink afterward on the V&A loggia, which once saw students of the Royal College of Science conduct chemical experiments in the open air.,On the following day, Imperial College London hosted a sister conference, Chemistry Futures 2040, which explored the future of research in chemistry. More than 220 delegates attended its new White City campus.,As part of the day, Imperial’s Molecular Sciences Research Hub was officially opened by the Mayor of London Sadiq Khan with Imperial’s President Alice Gast, Dame Mary and Bernard Taylor, Chair of the Royal Commission for the Exhibition for 1851 among the audience.,ChemFest events continued over the summer with tours of the Royal Institution archives, a Periodic Table Exhibition at the Royal Society of Chemistry, a tour of the Natural History Museum Core Research Laboratories, and, on 19 October, a
Royal Institution event exploring the life of William Crookes
, noted for his discovery of the element thallium and for his cathode-ray studies, which proved fundamental for the development of atomic physics.,ChemFest has proved to be a hugely successful collaboration between some of London’s leading scientific and cultural organisations, the fruit of the labours of many colleagues in the Science Museum, notably Susan Raikes, Scott Mackenzie Cook, Hetty Tapper and Megan Bradbury, and, of course, our chair Dame Mary, who lit the blue touch-paper of the celebrations.,She thanked all her colleagues for their hard work along with the participants, including ‘the small boy who so carefully checked my Periodic Table shirt and pronounced it free of errors.’,,Rupert Cole is still

Long before the
Robots exhibition
opened in 2017 (and then
toured the UK
), the museum hosted ‘Robotics Japan: Robot Technology’ back in 1991.,Both exhibitions introduced the public to
robots of the past
, present and future,  demonstrating how real robots might improve our lives.,One “future” design from Matsushita Electric Industrial (better known as Panasonic) in the 1991 exhibition was simply named
Portrait Drawing Robot
. An unimaginative name which failed to convey the machine’s creative ability.,The word ‘creative’ seems inappropriate to describe a machine without independent thought process, let alone imagination.,As the protagonist of the film
I, Robot
questions Sonny, an intelligent robot, “You are a clever imitation of life… Can a robot write a symphony? Can a robot take a blank canvas and turn it into a masterpiece?” to which Sonny responds, “Can you?”,Panasonic’s artist-robot, unable to respond to questions on its existence, simply drew by processing images of its sitters captured through its camera. It registered the thickness of lines it saw and converted these into instructions for the lines on the paper as coarse, fine, straight or curved brushstrokes.,Unlike a human artist, this robot gradually built the portrait by the order of pressure needed to make different brushstrokes.,Almost thirty years later, the first Artificial Intelligence (AI) painting was
sold at auction
in Christie’s New York for $432,500. ‘Portrait of Edmond de Belamy’, was an algorithm-generated work that could plausibly have been created by a skilled human hand.,﻿,Since the dawn of AI, scientists have been exploring the machine’s ability to generate human-level creative outputs such as poetry, stories, jokes and music. This ability is central to demonstrating that AI algorithms are in fact intelligent.,Several systems have been designed that automatically create visual art but the most common systems are GANs or
generative adversarial networks
, the medium behind ‘Portrait of Edmond de Belamy’.,These networks are loosely modeled on functions of the
human brain
, mimicking how we recognise and recreate images and sounds. The algorithms are fed huge data sets of images, from which they learn about certain features and then produce new images that are indistinguishable from the original data source. Even with the same inputs, the algorithm will each time render a different result, reflecting human creativity.,Obviously, the creators of ‘Portrait of Edmond de Belamy’ claim the AI’s ‘algorithms are able to emulate creativity.’,But do we need to think of these as emulation? The technique of absorbing a variety of images, including the work of others, and using that knowledge as inspiration for their own creative is the same process human artists have always used.,What remains largely unknown is how human artists integrate their knowledge of past art with their ability to generate new forms. The AI’s creative process is more literal, but does that make it any less valid as a form of art?,These debates are nothing new. With the introduction of
photography
in the 19th century, the camera changed the way images were created and how the tools of artistic creation developed.,We can look back on how the arrival of photography impacted the art market and society. Photography automated the reproduction process. It had a great impact on professions like the copyist artist, which almost disappeared.,Crucially, it saw a new generation of creators: artist photographers. You only have to look on
Instagram
to observe the creativity that increased access to this tool resulted in.,Thinking about AI as the artist of tomorrow may be like asking if the camera is the artist of today. Both are tools that aid the creative potential of humans. With AI, the tool is an algorithmic paintbrush allowing artists to become more efficient.,The intention and inspiration come from the human who designed and used the algorithm, and many believe this is not a collaboration with the AI, in the same way paint or a piano are not collaborators. AI is itself the new medium – one shaped by human intervention.,Looking at Panasonic’s ‘Portrait Drawing Robot’ and examples of more recent AI, portraiture has remained the most popular form of AI artworks.,Portraiture painting has always been heavily influenced by the trends of the period it was created in. So the use of AI in contemporary portraits may be telling of the times we live in now, a time when our lives are lived through technology, pixels on a screen and manipulated by computers."
https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/getting-a-grip-on-the-bebionic-hand/,Isabelle Lawrence,Getting A Grip On The Bebionic Hand,"Curator Isabelle Lawrence looks at the bebionic hand, an exciting new addition to our collection, and the history and future of artificial limbs.",Collections and Objects,"medicine,medicine galleries,robotics","Say hello to the bebionic hand, an exciting new addition to our collection. This is a ‘myoelectric’ prosthetic hand that can be controlled by moving the muscles in the arm.,Designed to be used by amputees or people born without one or both hands, this artificial hand can have a big impact on the lives of people who use it, enabling them to get a grip on the objects we use in our day to day lives.,Myoelectricity is the electrical activity that causes muscles to contract and relax, which causes them to contract and relax, enabling us to control different parts of the body. Sensors placed in the socket of the bebionic hand can detect these signals when the muscles in the wearer’s arm contract. The hand is battery powered, with multiple motors throughout that allow it to move.,It is also multi-articulating, meaning that the wrist and the fingers can be moved in a variety of different ways. With fourteen different grip patterns rather than a simple open-and-shut mechanism, the hand can be used to point, write, type, give a handshake, and more.,By combining both technologies, myoelectric signals prompt the fingers and wrist to flex, bend and rotate. In many ways, it mimics the behaviour of a human hand by responding to simple muscle movements in the arm.,Over the years we have acquired inflexible static hands, mechanical arms (which use straps and springs to grip objects), and even
this early myoelectric arm
from 1980.,Although the 1980 model uses similar technology to open and close the fingers, it’s range of movement is restricted. The bebionic is the first prosthetic in our collection that can be programmed to act in so many ways, with different grip patterns that allow the user to grip and manipulate objects of all shapes, sizes and textures, and offer an enhanced level of dexterity.,But why is this important? Critically, the different technologies that the bebionic utilises enable wearers to grip and manipulate all sorts of everyday objects, helping them to perform fine motor tasks in a world that can otherwise be disabling and frustrating.,For amputees and people who have been born without either hand, seemingly mundane tasks – such as tying your shoelaces, handwriting a note, or even swiping your way through Tinder on your touchscreen phone – can become more complicated.,Although individuals often find their own ways around these difficulties, prosthetics are tools designed to make these everyday tasks easier, by performing the function of missing or damaged parts of the body.,Often, they have been designed to fit seamlessly into the life of the wearer by helping them to complete tasks they need to perform to earn a living, to uphold any responsibilities they may have, or simply to live the life they wish to lead.,For example,
this sixteenth century hand
was created by an armorer to allow the owner to wield a weapon and pursue their fighting career.,However unnecessary it may be to pick up a sword or a mace in this day and age (although, to each their own), the fact remains that these prosthetics played an important role in their owner’s lives by helping them to achieve what they needed or wanted to do.,Likewise, the bebionic hand has been designed to meet more everyday needs in the contemporary world. Lightweight and dextrous, it is suited to gripping and operating the tools and technologies we use in our day to day lives such as pens, phones, computers, eating utensils, a car’s steering wheel, etc.,Stephen Lowry, an engineer who has used a whole range of different prosthetics since his hand was amputated in 1985, is particularly enthusiastic about the usefulness of the bebionic.,In his experience, the hand is not only a useful tool that helps him to perform daily tasks as fiddly as tying his shoelaces and as necessary as cooking dinner, but also offers unrivalled comfort and reliability.,After testing the hand, he was particularly impressed at how much lighter it was than the mechanical and earlier myoelectric hands he had previously used, which had caused him back problems.,He also appreciates the increased level of control that he has over the bebionic; he can trust that his fingers won’t open or move involuntarily, which was a problem he sometimes encountered when trialling earlier myoelectric hands. Considering that Stephen flies a small aircraft, it is quite important to him that he can trust the hand to behave itself.,However, if you are considering the bebionic as a potential prosthetic, you do need to bear in mind how it would fit into your lifestyle.,The hand is delicate, particularly the fingers which have multiple joints to allow for more flexibility but can break if placed under immense strain. If you plan on going rock climbing, or need to perform heavy-duty tasks, other models would be better suited.,Unfortunately, bionic hands can also be expensive, and prospective users need to gradually raise enough money to purchase one of these prosthetics, often with the help of private clinics and charities.,The bebionic offers a tantalising hint of what is yet to come, catapulting our prosthetic collection into the twenty-first century. Embodying one of the technologies that are currently being utilized to enhance the age-old artificial hand, it also reflects how the needs and desires of individual users are shaping the prosthetics being developed today.,New technologies are being used and developed constantly, which could radically alter the relationships that individuals have with their replacement limbs.,Prosthetics that can be controlled directly by the brain are already being tested, and there are hopes that prosthetics could also facilitate sensory feedback in the near future, allowing the wearer to ‘feel’ the objects they touch using their prosthetic hand!,The possibilities (and implications) are endless, and we will certainly be keeping an eager eye on what happens next in this ever-changing field!,﻿,Header image: Studio photograph of three artificial arms, 1890-1910, taken by Gillinghams of Chard, Somerset, late 19th to early 20th centuries. © Science Museum Group"
https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/lord-of-the-rings/,Alison Boyle,Lord Of The Rings?,,Collections and Objects,astronomy,"This week in 1977, astronomers
discovered faint rings around Uranus
. Or did they? It’s just possible that
William Herschel
beat them to it by almost 200 years. Herschel’s notes for February 22, 1789 say ‘A ring was suspected’. It was assumed he was mistaken, but
Dr Stuart Eves
, inspired by one of our objects, has a theory that could explain Herschel’s observations.,Herschel in 1794. (Credit: Science Museum / Science & Society),A few years ago, Stuart visited our
Blythe House
store to see this orrery, or planetary model – the only surviving one of this design.,It shows Uranus with six moons. Herschel discovered the innermost two, Titania and Oberon, in 1787. By 1794 he had reported four additional satellites. However, no other astronomer managed to see them and observations in the 1850s showed Herschel was mistaken and may have been looking at background stars near the planet.,Wanting to know more about this, Stuart studied
Herschel’s papers
, which is where he found the 1789 reference to the ring, and also one from 1792 referring to ‘a very faint ray, like a ring crossing the planet, over the centre’.,So if Herschel did see a ring, how come nobody else managed to until 1977? Well, Stuart’s theory is that if this ring behaves like
Saturn’s rings
then it might be getting darker and more diffuse, making it harder to see. Plus, the ring is only visible at certain alignments.,Herschel's 20ft telescope (Credit: Science Museum / Science & Society),But could Herschel really have seen a ring using his 20ft telescope, a giant of the time but diminutive by today’s standards? Well, he built the best telescopes of his era, and was a meticulous observer. So maybe, just maybe… We’ll never know for sure, but it shows what a visit to our stores can trigger!"

, which first flew (half a century ago!) in October 1960.,It’s a beautiful and terrifying craft, as Banner’s display brought home to me so strongly. A single jet engine with four swivelling nozzles enables the aircraft to take off vertically, hover, and fly forwards or backwards in a ballet of jet-powered precision – yet it’s a machine designed to kill.,Tough stuff – see both displays if you can."

Making the Modern World
gallery. The chalky cliffs, thatched cottage and country children make a pleasant enough pastoral scene, but what does it have to do with science?,The clue is in the sky, which represents ‘Cumulus breaking up; cirrus and cirrocumulus above’. These were the new names for the clouds, created by the meteorologist Luke Howard.,Howard was a commercial chemist who rose to fame after lecturing “On the Modification of Clouds” in 1802 to the Askesian Society, a scientific club founded by three young London Quakers. He proposed that, rather than being fleeting and innumerable, clouds could be reduced to just
three families
:
cumulus
,
stratus
and
cirrus
. Combinations were possible and clouds could change from one type to another. Howard was hailed as a genius who had grasped the clouds and brought them within the reach of science.,Amongst artists his reception was mixed. The German Romantic painter
Caspar David Friedrich
, for example, worried that ‘to force the free and airy clouds into a rigid order and classification’ would damage their expressive potential and even ‘undermine the whole foundation of landscape painting’.,John Constable
disagreed, arguing that ‘Painting is a science and should be pursued as an inquiry into the laws of nature. Why, then, may not landscape painting be considered a branch of natural philosophy, of which pictures are but the experiments?’ His cloud experiments have fascinated critics ever since."

Cystic Fibrosis Trust
and supported by Portman Building Society. In March the following year, a 12-year-old girl, Holly Wharton, was announced as the winner. Her design was made from Dolly’s wool and is now on display in

.,Dolly got me thinking about other sheep in the collections and a quick search found many more examples than I expected, even outside of our veterinary and agriculture collections.,For example, a sheep’s tooth used in South Devon to ward off toothache. The idea behind this
amulet
is to supposedly transfer the pain from person to animal tooth. And it wasn’t just sheep’s teeth that were used for this purpose.,Reaching into ancient history, sheep’s livers were used for divination by the Babylonians. This enabled healer-priests to forecast when the most opportune time for treatment would be or to aid diagnosis. The liver was considered the seat of life.,Sheep gut was also used for condoms. This poster comes with the tag line about the fabled 1700s Italian
Giacomo Casanova
by saying: ‘So if the world’s greatest lover made do with a sheep gut, surely you can use a condom’. Fair point…,Naturally, we have to give a nod to our other well-known sheep –

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/viewing-venus/,Alison Boyle,Viewing Venus,,Collections and Objects,"astronomy,exploration","UK astronomy enthusiasts are in for a serious case of Venus envy next week, as the planet transits the Sun. People in
other parts of the world
will have a good view, but while the 2004 transit was
seen across the UK
, this year’s – the last until 2117 – mostly happens after nightfall in these parts. Only the final stages will be visible at sunrise on 6 June, but that’s not stopping intrepid observers, who will be hoping that Britain’s infamous summer weather proves kind. Here’s a
map of events
if you would like to join in.,Or, if an early rise doesn’t appeal, why not concentrate on past transits instead? There are recorded observations for six transits from 1639 onwards (
here’s a map
of where some took place) and it’s a rich history of ambitious voyages, international collaboration and competition, precision instrumentation and personal sacrifice.,The most famous transit expedition is that of Captain James Cook, who sailed to Tahiti to observe the 1769 transit – although the main aim of his voyage was to claim the Southern Lands for the British Crown. From today, there’s a small display on the transit at the rear of our
Exploring Space
gallery, featuring one of the astronomical quadrants made for the Royal Society’s 1769 expeditions. These were used to establish the observers’ locations and help check timings, so that measurements from around the globe could be correlated in an attempt to
establish the Earth-Sun distance
.,We can’t say for sure that this instrument was the one used by Cook – his account of the voyage states that the quadrant was taken and dismantled by the Tahitians, and had to be hastily repaired; this one bears no obvious signs of mending. We do know that one of the clocks made for timing the transits, now on display in our
Making the Modern World
gallery, accompanied Cook on his third South Sea voyage in 1776.,Although less celebrated today, the two 19th century transits (1874 and 1882) also saw
major expeditions
, and were widely reported in the public sphere. This image shows the set up for the New Zealand station of Britain’s 1874 expeditions. It’s not clear if it was taken there,  or at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, where the equipment and observing huts were assembled and tested prior to departure.,In the 21st century, there is no longer an imperative to mount large-scale co-ordinated expeditions, as the Earth-Sun distance is readily measured by other means. But it’s still an opportunity for interesting science: the Hubble telescope is going to
use the Moon as a mirror
to observe the Venusian atmosphere, contributing to the search for extrasolar planets. It’s also a great chance for people around the world to take part in amateur observations, which can be done without expensive equipment.,You can read more about previous transit expeditions in recently-published books by

Inventor in Residence
, and it is my job to generate a
stream of products
that are interesting to the science-savvy, whilst engaging to those new to the Museum. If possible the products should also be wildly popular and generate lots of income. No pressure then.,Fortunately, the Museum provides an incredibly fertile space for generating ideas. Though my ideas tend toward the
quirky
, rather than world-changing, there are so many examples of ingenuity, insight and inventiveness, it’s hard not to be inspired. But where to start?,It’s not widely known that the Science Museum is home to just 5% of the Museum’s collection. The majority is tucked away in
Blythe House
in London, and at
Wroughton
, a former RAF airbase in Wiltshire. However, as the Science Museum is a showcase for the most iconic items in the collection, for me, it is the richest source of ideas.,I’m particularly drawn to the
Making the Modern World
gallery. In many ways it is the centerpiece of the Science Museum. Located on the ground floor, it exhibits objects chronologically, on a timeline starting in the 1770’s in the heyday of the Industrial Revolution, and ending with the
Clock of the Long Now
, a clock mechanism intended to keep time for 10,000 years. Walking through the gallery, is walking through the recent history of human development.,There are a couple of items in
Making the Modern World
that have directly inspired new products. One of the first glass cases that you encounter in the gallery contains what looks like a whisk with an accompanying pot. In fact it is the apparatus, made by
James Prescott Joule
, that defines the standard unit of energy, or “Joule”. Filling the pot with water, a “Joule” of energy is defined as the energy required to whisk the water until it has raised the temperature of the water by one degree.,This device got me thinking about how SI units are defined, and of measurement in general, and led to the creation of the
Word Count Pencil
, a pencil that has a scale printed along it’s length, to estimate the number of words you have written as the pencil wears out. A Gramophone in one of the cases along the side of the gallery inspired the
iGramo
, non-electrical method to amplify iPhones. Electro-magnets in the central glass cases, inspired my
Levitating Cutlery
idea. A sample of the first pure aluminium inspired me to design an
aluminium water bottle
that is decorated with an explanation of how the material is extracted, refined, and formed into the bottle.,Often, as I sit amongst the items in the gallery, trying to think up new product ideas, is gratifying to imagine all the inventors and scientists whose work surrounds me, doing likewise. Conjuring up new inventions and ideas using the power of their imagination. It makes me want to think harder and try to achieve more, and I find that profoundly inspiring.,I would urge anyone tasked with generating ideas, or impressed by ingenuity to treat themselves to a trip to the

",Exhibitions and Galleries,"cosmonauts,space","On this day (3 November) in 1957, just one month after the launch of
Sputnik
, a dog called
Laika
became the first living creature to orbit the Earth. But sadly, with no means of returning her safely to Earth, she was on a one-way mission. Enough reserve supplies were prepared for Laika to survive one week in orbit inside the Sputnik 2 satellite, but she overheated and died only a few hours after launch.,Laika’s flight followed earlier stratospheric flights with
dogs as crew
. These sub-orbital missions were crucial for gathering knowledge of what happens to living creatures in space, as well as testing the equipment, ejection and parachute landing systems that would later be used by cosmonauts. The
space dogs
were used all the way up until the first manned space flight and after, flying in Vostok-type spacecraft.,On 22 July 1951, after six months of training, two small dogs nicknamed
Tsygan and Dezik
were launched from the site of the first Soviet cosmodrome in a region called Kapustin Yar. At a height of 110 km, the head of the rocket containing the dogs separated and began to free-fall back down to Earth. They experienced intense G-forces during descent, but after a heavy jolt from the parachute, the cabin containing the two four-legged pilots slowed and touched down safely. The trip, which lasted 15 minutes from start to finish, made Tsygan and Dezik the first animals to experience space flight and to emerge from the craft unharmed.,The completely new field of space biology was asking many questions about whether humans and other animals could survive an extended trip into outer space. The scientists involved needed to test the boundaries of endurance on actual living creatures. Was it possible to survive the extreme accelerations and decelerations of launching and landing? How could basic life-support needs – such as air, water and food – be supplied away from the home planet? And finally, would the experience of weightlessness inside a small capsule be harmful? Scientists needed to test life-support equipment, develop a training regimen for crews and perform tests in space. All of this had to be completed before human crews could embark on space exploration.,By the time of the first
Soviet space dog crew
, American scientists had attempted a number of launches using monkeys in
V2
and Aerobee rockets, and all of them ended in the death of the animals. But the information collected during the flights demonstrated that the animals could cope with the intense G-forces and stresses of the rocket launches.,Chief Designer Sergei Korolev decided that the Soviet space programme would, on the other hand, work with dogs. The choice of dogs, ‘man’s best friend’, over monkeys, among our closest genetic relatives, was based on rational reasoning springing from emotional attachment. The Russian scientists believed they could build stronger bonds with the animals and so ensure their obedience. They also believed that the dogs eking out an existence on the harsh streets of Moscow would possess a survivalist temperament.,There were strict criteria for scouting the first-star squad of dogs. They had to be female because the specialised clothing and toilet technology was easier to tailor to them. And they needed to be small in size: 6 to 7 kg each to accommodate the strict weight limit for the rocket. These dogs also needed to have light-coloured fur, in order to show up clearly in front of the onboard camera. The scientists had even attempted to bleach the fur of one of their favourite darker dogs without success.,In the six years of stratospheric dog flights only a few launches ended in tragedy. But through these sacrifices, enough information was gathered on whether living beings were likely to survive a trip into space. After the launch of an untrained puppy called ZIB (a quick replacement for a runaway dog), Chief Designer Korolev was ecstatic. At the landing site, when greeted by the happy puppy, he announced to his colleagues:,‘Space travellers will soon be flying in our spaceships with state visas – on a holiday!’,These
early tests
, conducted in secrecy, culminated in the final question: could a living creature survive a prolonged stay in zero gravity?,The most successful canine mission was perhaps the one performed by
Belka and Strelka
in 1960, who completed 18 orbits and returned to Earth in perfect health. They were greeted by an international press corps at a news conference in Moscow and their friendly faces were broadcast around the world. Belka went on to have a litter of puppies, one of which was given to the American first lady Jacqueline Kennedy by Russian premier Nikita Khrushchev.,At the time of this gift, Korolev already knew the name of the cosmonaut who would be the first to fly into space. By the time of
Gagarin’s flight
, 48 dogs had been to space and 20 had perished."
https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/exploring-the-world-on-a-box/,Katrina Brain,Exploring the world on a box,An intricate painted box from The Courtauld Gallery’s collection is now on display in the museum.  ,At the Museum,"art,biology,exploration","The Courtauld Gallery’s
painted casket
may be just a single object, but it bears witness to the birth of zoology and botany as disciplines and to developments in global trade.,A lot is unknown about this object’s provenance, or record of ownership. But this fascinating object can teach a lot about how scientific knowledge was developed and spread in the 1600s.,This object
was very likely made in
Augsburg
, a city in modern-day Germany, which was Europe’s unofficial home for luxury furniture making in the 1600s. Craftsmen (unfortunately they were all men as far as we know) from Augsburg made elaborate items like cabinets, boxes, and writing desks for aristocratic customers.,In a time before trains or motor vehicles, it may seem curious that a small landlocked city in Germany became a manufacturing hub for goods crafted from imported materials.,But Augsburg was home to wealthy families who got into the business of
overseas trade
when shipping to Asia and South America became more affordable in the 16
th
century.,One of the most notorious Augsburg merchants was Konrad Rott, who held monopoly contracts on certain goods imported from Asia, most notably pepper.,Like other Augsburg merchants, he imported goods via Portugal, and half of everything he imported was given to the Portuguese crown in exchange for their cooperation.,When he ultimately went bankrupt due to a fluctuation in pepper prices that his business could not withstand, Rott faked his own death and fled Augsburg to live under a different name in Portugal.,All of the imported materials that make up this object – ivory, ebony, and rosewood – would have been imported by merchants like Rott.,The novelty of materials shipped from far-away places and their relative scarcity in Europe made these imports extremely expensive at the time when this box was made.,Ivory has often been called “white gold” and used to be purchased by the ounce like silver or gold.,Ebony wood, used in the parquetry patterns on the inside of the box’s lids, was so expensive in Europe in the 1600s that it was sometimes imitated with dyed, blackened pear wood to fool buyers.,Rosewood, also used in the parquetry interior, was not commonly imported from South America to Europe until the 17th century. Rosewood can be distilled into oil, and in this form it is a popular scent used in cosmetics.,High demand for rosewood in the 1900s eventually led to global scarcity. International law now prevents the growth of the rosewood market and restricts rosewood trade.,The explosion of imports of expensive materials like rosewood and ebony at the time when this box was created corresponded with significant improvements in trade infrastructure. The expansion of European trade networks also corresponded with an increased ability to gain and share knowledge about other parts of the world.,This box was made in Europe, yet some of the plants and animals painted on its exterior would have never been seen alive in Europe at the time. Assuming that whoever painted this box was European, they would have had to reference the drawings and paintings that others had made of these animals.,In the late 1500s, printed botanical and zoological books with drawings or woodcuts of animals were gaining popularity, but they were still expensive, and only owned by the wealthy or well-connected.,The most famous of these books was a series of six volumes by the Swiss physician Conrad Gessner, who published his
Historia Animalium
between 1551 and 1558.,Gessner was the first European to describe and depict many plants and animals
originating outside of Europe
, including the tulip and the bird of paradise.,As soon as one artist created an
image of a previously unseen animal
, others would copy it into their own books and artwork.,This reliance on other artists’ images in order to depict animals which many people had never actually seen in person meant the perpetuation of many mistakes in how these animals or plants were pictured.,Gessner’s well-known and widely copied drawing of bird of paradise was based on a dead specimen that had been shipped to Europe from its native New Guinea. Birds of paradise often had their limbs removed in local rituals and for preservation as specimens before they were transported to Europe.,As a consequence, Gessner’s drawing (which was widely published as a print in his book), was of a bird lacking wings or legs – as were the drawings by many European artists who came after him.,It was said at the time that these birds must have floated magically in the breeze, only landing when they died, which explained why the skins didn’t appear to have wings or legs. But in reality, the lack of limbs in many drawings may have simply stemmed from the fact that the artists didn’t know what the limbs would have looked like on a live bird.,Systematic mistakes were also made in flower drawings in the 16
th
and 17
th
centuries. It was thought at the time that the purpose of flowers was to protect the developing fruit. So, the reproductive organs of flowers were occasionally mis-drawn or omitted, even though we now know that these are the very reason for flowers’ existence. Some of the lilies on this box are painted with visible stamens and pistils, but others are painted without these critical pollen-and ovule-producing features.,Of course, it is not unusual for artists to make art that is not meant to perfectly mirror nature. But these errors are particularly interesting because the artists who created paintings of plants and animals at the time were also some of the first botanists and zoologists.,By systematically indexing and classifying a wide variety of organisms, comparing them, and documenting their characteristics in their books of drawings or paintings, these artists created a new field of scientific inquiry.,At the time, these makers of books about plants and animals were creating and sharing new knowledge—but there was no need to define that knowledge as a discipline, to categorize it as an art or a science, nor to classify the people involved as artists or botanists or zoologists.,Unfortunately, even a wealth of knowledge about the societal and scientific context in which this object was created does not solve the mystery of how, and why, this box came to be.,There are
two crests
on the top of the box, which are likely the crests of the former owners, but these have been attributed to multiple possible families over time.,The presence of two coats of arms means that it may have been made to celebrate a marriage. The current attribution of one of the crests is to the Dukes of Pommern-Stettin, or Pomerania (which is in modern-day Northern Germany and Poland), and the other is that of the Schleswig-Holstein family.,But there were multiples marriages between these families in the 1600s, so it is difficult to say who it belonged to. And as the
owners are unknown
, so too are the makers. To add to the mystery, the double-lidded design and decision to paint the box are not terribly common, so what the box was made for is also uncertain.,Curiously, this box documents a variety of knowledge that Europeans held about the wider world in the 1600s when it was created. Yet, this fascinating object will not yield its own secrets easily.,The

Exploring Space
gallery. Space Curator Doug Millard explores the story behind ‘Planet Science’ below.,It’s hard to believe that we didn’t know what the surface of Mars looked like until 1964. That was the year NASA’s Mariner 4 spacecraft flew past the planet and returned the first images. And for many it was a big disappointment; no rivers or oceans; no vegetation; no indications of life at all – just a seemingly barren, crater-strewn terrain looking much like our Moon.,Today the red planet has been visited by a flotilla of spacecraft flying past, orbiting or even landing, and most returning ever-improving imagery. The Science Museum’s new ‘Planet Science’ display projects just one of these scenes: a glorious whole-world rendition of Mars showing ice caps, the
Valles Marineris
canyon – ten times the size of Earth’s Grand Canyon – and other surface features. The image is projected onto a white globe suspended in the
Exploring Space
gallery. The image itself rotates presenting the impression of a mini-Mars floating in space.,We do not stay at Mars but move on to other worlds: Jupiter confronts us in all its clouded majesty; the largest planet in the solar system – composed almost entirely of hydrogen and helium. We can watch the coloured cloud bands swirling their ways around the vast planet. Then onto one of Jupiter’s moons: Io, otherwise known as the cosmic pizza because of its yellow and red blotches … which in reality are sulphurous effusions and eruptions on this volcanically active world.,The final destination looks a little like Earth with blue oceans, continents and white clouds but is an imagined planet way beyond the solar system. We are now discovering thousands of these ‘exoplanets’ but we have yet to see one in any detail – they are just too far away even for the most powerful of telescopes. But someday soon more sophisticated and efficient tools and instruments will enable scientists to peer ever more deeply out into space and towards these still murky and mysterious worlds. And one day these observations may tell us whether we are alone or just one of many life forms strewn through our galaxy.,The Planet Science display is courtesy of Science On a Sphere® from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (

Cosmonauts: Birth of the Space Age
, we reunited Britain’s first astronaut, Helen Sharman, with her spacesuit around a quarter of a century after she first wore it for her pioneering mission to the
Mir space station
.,Helen’s journey began in 1989 when she, then a food technologist, answered an advertisement that she had heard on her car radio:  “Astronaut wanted. No experience necessary.” With Timothy Mace, she was eventually selected from over 13,000 applicants to represent the British
Juno Mission
and she spent 18 months training in
Star City
before she was picked for the launch.,Helen had to endure the centrifuge (to experience g-forces) and hydro tank (for spacewalk training) but was fortunate that her physiology was well suited to these challenges. However, when it came to getting dressed for space she admitted: “Perhaps the greatest discomfort I suffered was doing tests in an off the shelf spacesuit, which was suited to fit a man.”,For Juno, Helen was measured in 54 different places to ensure her Sokol (‘Falcon’) suit was a snug fit and could protect her at the riskiest stages of her mission, where there is a likelihood of cabin depressurization, during take-off, docking, undocking, and landing.,In the
Science Museum
, we reunited Helen with her spacesuit along with television presenter
Dallas Campbell
, who is working with filmmaker Chris Riley on a programme about spacesuits. Later I joined them for an
event at the Royal Institution
, where Cosmonauts curator Doug Millard and conservator Kate Perks also brought along Helen’s radio helmet.,The world’s first spacesuits were developed by the NPP (Research & Development Production Enterprise) Zvezda (‘Star’), which was built in 1952 in the Moscow province of Tomilino and was led for many decades by academician Guy Severin, an expert in developing and creating life-support systems for pilots and cosmonauts. To this very day, every cosmonaut from
Yuri Gagarin
onwards has passed through this venerable space institution. “The road to the cosmos passes via Zvezda,” explains Severin’s successor, Sergei Pozdnyakov, chief executive and designer.,The world’s first spacesuit, SK-1 – orange, with a white helmet inscribed in red ‘CCCP’ – was worn in the first flight by Gagarin to the sixth by
Valentina Tereshkova
. Development of the SK-1 by Zvezda began in 1959 but Helen Sharman would wear a later design, the Sokol, which was developed more than a decade later in response to a tragedy.,Pressure suits had been used on the early Vostok space missions, but when the Soyuz spacecraft was being developed in the mid-1960s the controversial decision was taken not to use them on the new spacecraft. That changed after the death in 1971 of the crew of
Soyuz-11
, Georgi Dobrovolsky, Vladislav Volkov and Viktor Patsaev, who all perished while returning from the Salyut-1 space station when their descent module lost pressure.,Human space flights were temporarily halted and Zvezda designed the new Sokol-K spacesuit within a year. The spacesuit design evolved from the pressure suits worn by the first jet pilots to help them to cope with low pressure and lack of oxygen at high altitudes by supplying their air to them in a person-shaped‚ pressurized bag.,Zvezda replaced the rigid helmet of these jet pilot suits with a soft, non-removable helmet, including a hinged glass visor which could be lifted. To become a space suit they also had to redesign its basic shape. Pozdnyakov explained that, while an aircraft pilot adopts the same position as a car driver, a cosmonaut sits more like “an embryo in the womb”.,The resulting Sokol-K first came into use in 1973. Since its introduction, Zvezda has tweaked the design, trying various different gusset-openings, lacings, separation of the two halves at chest or waist level, and water-cooled emergency suits. In an emergency, it turns out that it is most important to have a spacesuit that can be put on quickly and, by the close of the 1970s, the organisation had essentially settled on today’s model, the Sokol KV-2. “In space travel, it is absolutely essential that all the technology and the systems should be 100% reliable, so that most of our time is spent not so much on developing new things, but on optimizing, perfecting and testing the old,” said Pozdnyakov.,The 22 lb suit consists of an inner layer of rubberised material and outer layer of white nylon. The suit includes the cosmonaut’s feet and its gloves attach by means of blue anodised aluminium wrist couplings. There is a pressure gauge on the left wrist and a mirror on the right to help the cosmonaut see things that would otherwise be outside his or her field of view.,The fundamental design of any spacesuit ultimately depends on its use. For the Buran (‘Snowstorm’) spaceship, cosmonauts would take a more active role, demanding a new kind of spacesuit. The Soviet manned lunar programme required the development of the Krechet (‘Gyrfalcon’) space suit, which had a rigid body with soft sleeves and soft trouser legs.  This led to the Orlan (‘Sea-Eagle’) series of semi-rigid spacesuits, used for spacewalks.,The Sokol holds a special place in space culture, remarks Pozdnyakov. Hundreds of these suits have been made over the years. The Sokol “has become a symbol of man’s flight into the cosmos,” he explained in the
book to accompany the exhibition
. “As the developers, we find it very nice to hear Sandra Bullock, the star of the Hollywood film Gravity, saying that the Russian space suit is a work of art.”,Update: Helen Sharman’s spacesuit is now on display in the Science Museum’s

Apollo 10 command module
and crew of three splashed into the Pacific Ocean after eight days in space. The mission, a dry run for Apollo 11, returned valuable information about our nearest cosmic neighbour ahead of the Moon landing later that year.,The team of three astronauts – Thomas Stafford, John Young and Eugene Cernan – returned with the most impressive images of the Moon surface ever seen. Thomas Stafford described the surface as “very smooth, like wet clay”. Two months later the Apollo 10 mission proved its worth as Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first humans to walk on the surface of the Moon.,Apart from the giant Apollo 10 command module on display in our
Making the Modern World
gallery (the only one outside of the United States), we have smaller, yet just as significant, objects from the Apollo 10 mission in our collection, including mission patches.,Mission patches have been an important part of the military long before humans were sent in space. Many of the first astronauts started their lives as pilots of planes not spacecraft. With this background the tradition to wear specially designed patches became, though not smoothly, a custom of NASA missions.,Interestingly the astronauts are heavily involved in the design of their mission patches and the Apollo 10 mission was no different. Gene Cernan explained that his team, with the help of artist Allen Stevens, wanted a badge which showed the mechanics and goals of their mission.,They decided on a patch in the shape of a shield with the mission number written in Roman numerals stretching from the Moon to their space capsule orbiting above. The name of the mission and the astronauts are clearly visible around the edge of the shield.,Each culture has used space mission patches in its own way.,In 1963 the Russian cosmonaut
Valentina Tereshkova
blasted into space in the spacecraft Vostok 6.,Not only did she became the first woman in space but she is also considered the first cosmonaut to wear a mission patch, two years before the US officially introduced them into their space programme. Tereshkova’s insignia was a white dove with the letters CCCD stitched below.,We now have another patch to look forward to seeing, that of Tim Peake, who was announced as the UK’s first official astronaut last week at the Science Museum.,Peake will be launching into space in December 2015 to spend six months on the International Space Station (ISS). Although his mission may be different to that of Valentina Tereshkova and the crew of the Apollo 10, Peake is not unlike space explorers of yesteryear as he will be continuing to push the boundaries of human endurance and explore the unknowns of space."

Middlesex University
are investigating different kinds of memory. The research, led by Dr Emma Ward, aims to further our understanding of how conscious and unconscious memory work, and how they change over the lifespan.,We are constantly bombarded with information, but how much of what we see do we remember? Is what we remember linked to what we actually look at and attend to, or do we also remember things that we were not directly looking at or trying to remember? Does the way in which we think about what we see affect how we remember it? Do we remember some things consciously and other things unconsciously? How does our conscious and unconscious memory for what we see change over our lifespan?,To answer these questions we are inviting people aged 12 years to 85 years upwards to take part in a short experiment that involves making some quick decisions about objects presented on a computer screen, as well as a test designed to assess conscious (explicit) and unconscious (implicit) memory. Explicit memory is the ability to consciously recall prior experiences and previously learned information, while implicit memory is involved in such things as playing a musical instrument and riding a bicycle – with practice we do not need to consciously recall the actions involved.,The computerised experiment, which will be performed individually and anonymously, will measure the speed and accuracy of participants’ responses. Friendly researchers will first explain more about what is involved and participants will receive further information to take away at the end.,Based on this research we hope to gain further knowledge about how explicit and implicit memory work and changes in these forms of memory with age. A large body of research suggests that our ability to consciously remember information declines with age, but it is unclear whether our ability to unconsciously benefit from information to which we have been exposed changes over the lifespan. Some researchers believe that implicit memory remains stable over the lifespan despite a reduction in explicit memory, and recently it has even been reported that older adults show greater implicit memory compared to younger adults.,This type of research is normally conduced in laboratories and involves the comparison of relatively small samples of young (18-30 years) and older (65+ years) participants, and moreover young participants tend to be university students in their 20s. Conducing this research at the Science Museum will help us get a large sample of participants that is not only more representative of the general population, but will also allow us to map explicit and implicit memory from 12 years to 85+ years rather than simply comparing two age groups.,In addition, the research comes with large potential implications for the development of strategies and techniques to improve and enhance memory, and it is our hope that the findings will be of use in the development of memory training strategies.,This Live Science event is taking place in the Who Am I? gallery on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays from 11:00-13:00, 14:00-17:30, 9 October – 17 November.

",Exhibitions and Galleries,"chemistry,materials,plastics","Alexander Parkes was born in Birmingham on 29 December 1813. In his early career he described himself as an artist, and only later a chemist. He might also have described himself as a metallurgist.,A decorative metalworker by training, Parkes was to turn his sharp intelligence towards a variety of old and new materials in the burgeoning industrial world of mid-19th-century Britain. His life was an active one – he was granted over 66 patents. He also found time to father 17 children with two wives, his second wife being the friend of his eldest daughter.,Parkes had a varied and successful career in metallurgy, working on a number of processes, including the desilverising of lead – known as the Parkes process. While employed at Elkington, Mason and Company in Birmingham, he developed a process for electroplating works of art and later fragile natural objects. The epitome of this technique was a silver-plated spider’s web presented to Prince Albert.,Parkes is perhaps best known for the eponymous Parkesine – the first form of celluloid – an early semi-synthetic plastic based on gun cotton. He took out his first related patent in 1855. Parkes later won a bronze medal for excellence of product in the International Exhibition of 1862 and later a silver medal at the Paris Universal Exhibition in 1867.,Henry Bessemer
, of steel production fame, was a colleague of Parkes. Indeed Bessemer topped the list of the investors in the Parkesine Company set up in 1866, although the company failed in 1868 – probably because of issues associated with quality and flammability. Parkes, though a prolific inventor, was no businessman. We might see him as a victim of an agile but perhaps too busy mind, and of a strong moral conscience. When he developed a potentially lucrative explosive powder, he refused to sell it to the British, French or Russian governments.,In a letter written on 7 March 1881, Parkes rather plaintively remarked that: ‘In answer to the American Inquiry “Who Invented Celluloid” … I do wish the World to know who the inventor really was, for it is a poor reward after all I have done to be denied the merit of the invention.’,Celluloid, the direct descendant of Parkesine, became a great commercial success, used to make a range of decorative goods, often imitating the more expensive ivory, tortoiseshell and mother-of-pearl. Perhaps its most enduring legacy was its application in cinematic film. Parkes had foreseen the use of Parkesine film as a replacement for glass photographic negatives as early as 1856. Even he would have been amazed by the development of celluloid film and the birth of the Hollywood film industry.,Parkesine is a fragile material, subject to degradation by light, so is seldom put on display. But from December 2013 to mid 2014 a selection of objects made from this beautiful and rare semi-synthetic plastic can be seen at the
Science Museum
, together with other items associated with the life and works of Alexander Parkes."

contrasting concerns
. A waste of public money and scientific resource or a defensive tool against the global terrorist threat?,But rather than focus on the possible death of smallpox, I’d like to take a look at the death of one of its greatest enemies,
Edward Jenner
. The English country doctor who introduced the vaccine for smallpox at the end of the 18
th
century, died on the 26
th
January 1823.,There is much Jenner-related material in our collections, but alongside

is a small group of objects linked to his death – and burial.,This rather garish padded affair, with wheels, is the chair that he died in. The cause of death being recorded as
apoplexy
– what we would now refer to as a stroke. Physically incapacitated, he had finally succumbed aged 73, seated in his country house in Gloucestershire.,Now a
museum
, the site is almost as famed for its alleged
‘spectral events’
than its connections with the pioneering doctor.,These hair clippings were taken from Jenner’s head shortly after his death. This was quite a common practice, with the hair often being integrated into
brooches
and other ornate
mourning jewellery
. We actually have several samples, which does raise concerns about the dignity of his natural coiffure at the time of internment.,Finally, and most curiously, is this tiny fragment of black cloth, held within a glass topped container. Inside, a hand-written note proclaims it is “A piece of cloth taken from Dr. Jenner’s coffin, March 23rd 1854”.,This date is more than three decades after Jenner’s death, but it is the day before the burial of his son
Robert

Victoria Falls
. As I stood at the falls’ edge drenched in spray, I spotted double rainbows formed by sunlight being refracted through the water droplets.,One of the first people to explain how rainbows form was the Persian mathematician
Kamal al-Din al-Farisi
, who was born around 1260. Using a glass sphere filled with water to represent a raindrop, he showed that sunlight is bent as it enters the drop, reflects off the back of the drop, and is bent again on its way out. If rays are reflected twice inside the drop, a secondary rainbow is formed with the colours reversed.
Here’s
a more detailed explanation. Around the same time
Theorodic of Freiberg
performed a similar experiment. The two were not in contact, but both had been influenced by
Ibn al-Haytham
‘s
Book of Optics
. You can find out more about al-Farisi and al-Haytham in the
1001 Inventions exhibition
.,Isaac Newton
explained that the rainbow’s colours arise as a result of white light being split into its constituent colours. Many people will have childhood memories of making a Newton colour wheel with a disc of cardboard and a pencil. Here’s a late 19th century version.,As our understanding of the nature of light has continued to change, so has our understanding of the rainbow.

30
th
anniversary of Pac-Man
highlighted two things in particular. Firstly, I’m as rubbish at playing it now as I was in the 80s, but secondly it’s a reminder of just how far computer games have advanced in three decades. In contrast, a less publicised 30 year anniversary reminds us that some other things don’t progress as quickly as we’d like.,Back in May 1980, the
World Health Assembly
confirmed the global eradication of
smallpox
. Last week a
statue
was unveiled by the
World Health Organisation (WHO)
to celebrate the event. But 30 years on, despite continuing advances in medical knowledge, it remains the only infectious human disease eradicated by direct intervention.,Like it’s disfiguring pustules, smallpox had scarred human history. Killing tens of millions over many centuries, it’s presence is well represented in our collections.,If
Edward Jenner’s
18
th
century vaccine first opened to door to eradication, it took the
global campaigns
of the 20
th
century to finally get the disease under control.,After a huge international effort, the last naturally occurring cases were recorded in 1977. The
final death from smallpox
came the following year, bizarrely and tragically in Birmingham, after an accidental exposure at a research facility.,Hopefully, we won’t have to wait until 2040 for the next success. A handful of other diseases are slowly getting close to the brink. And while the original target date for eliminating the most well known of these –
polio
– has past, it’s possible that like smallpox, it too could soon be
confined to history

Lockheed Martin

NASA
back in 1998. It contains all sorts of goodies to teach youngsters about how people might survive on Mars. It even includes a pack of seeds flown on

in 2007.,There was a time when such items would not be considered for the Science Museum’s Collections: they would have been classed as ephemera and used only in support activities like talks and workshops. But
Destination Mars
should be formally accessioned now because  it can tell stories about current and future space exploration, the scientific and technological challenges of going to Mars, space education and, of course, a specific Shuttle mission (that also happened to return a British born astronaut –
Michael Foale
–
from the Mir space station
in 1997).,We are told we live in a digital world (this blog does support the argument) but I think there will long be a role for physical things like the
Destination Mars
kit. There’s something about the artefact that appeals, and particularly to the young as they explore and make their way in life. Sometimes it stimulates a life-long interest, maybe points towards a future career.,Finding the kit reminded me of something else in the office that should also go into the collections:
Touchdown on the Moon

small tank of chemicals

United Kingdom Space Agency

We might shorten it to something pronounced UK-SAR or perhaps to a simple abbreviation reading YOO-KAY-ESS-AY.,Back in the 60s a fair chunk of UK space research was carried out at the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE – pronounced AR-AY-EE) in Farnborough, Hampshire.,The Science Museum has many examples of the Establishment’s experimental work, which extended well beyond space endeavours like the Skylark rocket:,To aviation research including the Concorde project and high altitude suiting:,And on to breakthrough technologies, like the strengthening of carbon fibre:,But back to the RAE name itself, which substituted ‘Air’ with ‘Aerospace’ in 1988 then, as rationalisation and privatisation beckoned, ditched the whole caboodle in favour of DRA (Defence Research Agency), DERA (Defence Evaluation Research Agency) and finally to the present post-privatisation forms of QinetiQ – the company – and DSTL (Defence Science and Technology Laboratory) – a government agency… which brings us back to UKSA.,On April 1
st
2010 UKSA takes over from BNSC (British National Space Centre) which had been coordinating the UK’s various space activities for over 25 years. Some say it was doomed because it lacked a dedicated budget or executive powers, but I suspect the main reason it was finally killed off was its lack of vowels: BNSC – try making a memorable acronym out of that…,Whereas NASA – whoa! Consonant-vowel-consonant-vowel, guaranteed to stick in the mind. That’s really how America got to the Moon – by perfecting the art of abbreviating and acronyming. They made a

The answer, I probably don’t hear you cry, is hydrogen peroxide and cleanliness.,You see, to clean my newly acquired contacts involves bathing them overnight in a solution of
hydrogen peroxide
. Peroxide is a pretty powerful chemical agent and disinfects the lenses in 6 hours. If you put your lenses in too soon the still active chemical will turn on your eyeballs and cause them to gush tears like Gordon Ramsay’s head onion peeler. After six hours, though, the peroxide is decomposed and all you are left with is clean and lifeless water.
The lens holder includes a small piece of material (I have yet to identify it) that catalyses the decomposition of the peroxide solution. If it didn’t then the peroxide would remain and, having successfully killed the bugs on your lenses, then do its best to kill the cells of your cornea too. And this is where the rocket engine connection comes in.,The reaction that decomposes the peroxide also produces oxygen – you can see it bubbling off the catalytic material. That same type of reaction, albeit using extremely concentrated hydrogen peroxide, was exploited in the engines of Britain’s
Black Arrow
space rocket to launch the Prospero satellite into orbit in 1971.,The catalyst used was silver metal gauze and it decomposed the peroxide violently into oxygen and steam, which then ignited kerosene fuel, and so provided thrust to lift the rocket. In fact, earlier rocket engines dispensed with fuel altogether and replied on the thrust of the decomposing peroxide alone.,Oh, and the cleanliness connection? Well, peroxide rocket engines are considered ‘clean’ or green as their exhaust, after all, contains little more than oxygen and steam."

It was the leading sensation of the 1907 soiree … the great inventor expounded his discovery, and sent his obedient little model of the trains of the future up gradients, round curves and across a sagging wire.’,It seems certain Wells had seen Brennan’s device in the flesh.

evidence that the Sun hosts Rossby waves.,The waves form in rotating fluids and can be observed in the atmosphere and in the oceans on Earth. However, their existence on the Sun has long been debated.,Because the Sun is also rotating, and because it’s made largely of plasma that acts, in some respect, like a magnetized ocean world, the existence of Rossby-like waves should not come as a surprise, said McIntosh, who directs NCAR’s High Altitude Observatory.,Unlike Earth, which is surrounded by satellites, scientists historically have been able to study the Sun from only one viewpoint: from the direction of Earth. But from 2011 to 2014, scientists had an unprecedented chance to view the Sun’s entire atmosphere.,During that period, observations from NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), which sits between the Sun and Earth, were supplemented by measurements from NASA’s Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) mission.,Analysis of the data gathered by these craft revealed bands of magnetized activity that sweep slowly across the Sun – just like the Rossby waves on Earth.,‘The discovery of Rossby-like waves on the Sun could be important for the prediction of solar storms, the main drivers of space weather effects on Earth,’ commented Ilia Roussev, program director in the US National Science Foundation’s Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences.,Teimuraz Zaqarashvili of the Space Research Institute of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Graz, believes Rossby waves might be an important tool to predict long-term appearance of solar flares and coronal mass ejections, after recently publishing a theoretical analysis of wave dynamics in the Sun’s interior which shows
rhythms similar to those observed in solar storms
. ‘Internal magnetised Rossby waves are trapped at lower latitudes where solar storms generally appear,’ he said. ‘Plasma conditions in the interior favour the wave periods which are observed in solar activity, therefore the waves might drive solar surface magnetic weather. Future theoretical modelling and observations may significantly improve prediction of solar storms.’,The Science Museum, alongside its recent exhibition

The Sun: Living With Our Star
which opened at the museum in October 2018, I’ve been exploring the summer accessories that one should never leave home without. Sunscreen and a hat are always a good idea, but few can give the wearer a look of cool aloofness that a hip pair of sunglasses can provide. Beyond their fashion credentials, sunglasses can also be very necessary to help us see through harsh glare and protect our eyes from damaging ultraviolet rays.,But how did sunglasses become the epitome of summer cool and how do they protect us? Here are some examples of historic eyewear that show how function and fashion evolved to create your favourite pair of sunnies.,In his work
Natural History
, Pliny the Elder described how the Roman Emperor Nero would watch gladiator matches through an emerald. This has been considered by some as a rather opulent, if a bit ambiguous, account of a precursor to sunglasses. Some speculate that this was because Nero was near-sighted or that it was meant to shield the Sun’s glare. Whatever his reason, it is almost certain that the results would not have been crystal clear.,Some of the earliest known examples of ‘snow goggles’ were fashioned by Inuit peoples in the arctic regions of North America. Known as
nigaugek
or
igguag
, they were developed some 2,000 years ago. They were made from many kinds of materials, including wood, bone or straw and featured small slits that limited the amount of sunlight that reached the eye. These were meant to prevent snow blindness, a painful condition caused by overexposure to ultraviolet light. Modern research has shown them to be very effective.,Dating back about 900 hundred years, Chinese people were known to use flat pieces of smoky quartz as vision aids. Known as
Ai Tai
, meaning ‘dark clouds covering the Sun’, these types of lenses were incorporated into spectacle frames around the 15th century. They were worn for many purposes which included therapeutic and ceremonial uses. Some historical accounts describe them being worn by court judges to conceal their facial expressions during trials.,The first tinted spectacles intended specifically for sun protection were worn in Venice, Italy in the late 18th century. They were known as Goldoni Glasses, named after the famous playwright Carlo Goldoni who popularised the style. They were most often worn by gondoliers who needed protection while working in the sunny canals of Venice.,Also in the 18th century, therapeutic eye-preservers became popular in Britain for those who suffered from pre-existing conditions that made them sensitive to light. Though not technically considered sunglasses, it was thought that their blue or green lenses would correct vision impairments and alleviate discomfort caused by glare.,Some of the first examples of inexpensive mass-produced sunglasses were made by Foster Grant and sold to beach-goers in Atlantic City, United States in 1929. With the advent of injection moulding techniques, Foster Grant was able to manufacture sunglasses made from celluloid. Sales were bolstered by advertisements featuring Hollywood celebrities, making sunglasses a fashion staple.,During World War II, military organisations began designing spectacles for pilots who needed glasses that would enhance their vision and reduce glare at high altitude. The US Army Air Corps enlisted the help of eyeglasses maker Bausch & Lomb, who developed the iconic Ray-Ban Aviator in 1939. The RAF also designed anti-glare glasses for their pilots, such as these pictured.,Polaroid lenses were invented in the 1930s in Massachusetts, United States. Polaroid applied a filter to lenses that blocked glare from reflected light, greatly increasing visibility. This made activities such as driving, skiing and cycling much safer and more comfortable. Though polaroid lenses do improve vision, they do not always block ultraviolet light.,Today, it is understood that exposure to ultraviolet light can lead to cataracts and vision loss later in life. By the 1970s many countries, including Australia the United States and those in Europe, adopted standards of ultraviolet protection for sunglasses. When looking for your next pair of sunnies, be sure to go for a pair that is certified to block ultraviolet to protect your vision!,Learn more about humanity’s relationship with our nearest star in

surprised forecasters
and come as a timely reminder that we need more accurate forecasts of potentially damaging space storms.,The wind of particles from the Sun created a “crack” in Earth’s magnetic field last Saturday night, causing spectacular light shows in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, with the
aurora borealis
snaking across the sky in Northern America and the
aurora australis
seen in New Zealand.,The storm was even more surprising since it took place during the solar minimum, the period in the sunspot cycle when solar activity is lowest and sunspots least abundant.,To mark our autumn 2018 blockbuster exhibition,
The Sun: Living With Our Star
, the Science Museum and a team at Reading University ran a
citizen science project
to research patterns in solar storm activity to, ultimately, try to improve space weather predictions.,Super-heated, electrically-charged material from the Sun can cause severe disruption to power grids, satellite navigation and communication.,This Saturday marks the anniversary of the most violent ever known, the so-called Carrington Event of 1859, which would cause devastating effects if a storm of its magnitude were to take place during today’s connected, technological era.,So far 1,500 people have classified the complexity of more than 130,000 images for the Reading University/Museum citizen science experiment, so the project is around three quarters complete, said Chris Scott, Professor of Space and Atmospheric Physics, who is running the experiment with his Reading University colleague Shannon Jones.,This week’s geomagnetic storm was
rated 3 or “strong”
on the 1 to 5 scale for these events by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and it underlines the importance of the citizen science project because ‘forecasters did not see this coming,’ said Prof Scott.,This was a slow-moving wave of charged particles from the Sun, known as a coronal mass ejection, or CME. However, the magnetic fields of the CME were aligned in such a way that its energy was ‘efficiently transferred to Earth,’ causing the aurorae, said Prof Scott.,A recent survey, commissioned from YouGov by the museum shows that attitudes have changed little
– and for the worse –
since a
set of workshops in 2014/15 along with an online surve
for the Science and Technology Facilities Council revealed three quarters of people know very little or almost nothing about the threat.,The UK-wide survey reveals that over 97% of the population know little or nothing about space weather and over 80% are not worried about the impact of a potentially severe space storm.,Even though there have been
warnings that the UK should plan
now to mitigate the effects of a rare but potentially serious solar superstorm, the survey reveals that more could be done by the public to prepare for severe space weather.,According to
a report published in 2013 by the Royal Academy of Engineering
, the first in depth assessment done in the UK, a solar superstorm is inevitable at some point and will degrade the performance of the electricity grid, satellites, GPS systems, aviation and possibly mobile communications.,Through this citizen science project, everyone has the chance to find out more about this threat and help protect our planet.

How did sun protection become a multi-billion-pound market?,Like most things, sun protection products find their origin in antiquity, where a variety of plants and minerals were used on skin, to reflect UV rays, such as calcite powder and clay – like the white minerals, titanium dioxide and zinc oxide, found in modern sun creams.,It wasn’t until the late 1920s that the first synthetic chemical sun protection arrived on the (US) scene, an emulsion of benzyl salicylate and benzyl cinnamate, though a mass market for such a product had not quite arrived yet.,In the early twentieth century ‘sunning oneself’, as it was then called, was a medically-prescribed activity – UV rays promoted by physicians as therapies for tuberculous and rickets.,By the 1930s sunbathing had become a popular pastime for pleasure seekers. Some have credited
Coco Chanel
with starting a trend for tanning, after she got accidentally sunburnt in 1923 on a cruise to Cannes.,Nevertheless, the French Riviera would be the setting for the birth of the first commercial suntan lotion.,Eugene Schueller
, the founder of cosmetics giant L’Oréal, was a fair-skinned chemist with a penchant for sailing. Failing to devise himself a successful formula to combat his frequent sunburn, he tasked the chemists of L’Oréal laboratories with the job.,In April 1935 they presented him with a ‘sun oil’ that contained benzyl salicylate as the active ingredient, the same chemical used in the first chemical sunscreen of 1928.,Widely used in the cosmetics industry as a component of perfumes, benzyl salicylate works by absorbing, or filtering out, UVB light, the radiation that causes the skin to burn.,Two months later Schueller launched the product on the Riviera under the name ‘Ambre Solaire’.  Its iconic brown, indented bottle was marketed through posters depicting tanned bodies of women.,Ambre Solaire tapped into an aspirational ideal, based on the earlier medical notions, that a tanned body was a healthy one. Its associations with the French Riviera and affluent beach holidays, as well as the (gendered) use of models, presented the product as part of a luxury lifestyle.,Sun tan oils, like Ambre Solaire, Piz Buin and the US Coppertone brand, were intended to encourage tanning without a burn. It was not until the 1970s that the market shifted towards ‘sun protection’, as the link between sun exposure and skin cancer was becoming more publicly known.,In 1974 Franz Greiter, Austrian chemist and
founder of Piz Buin
, introduced the term ‘sun protection factor’ or SPF, which is a formula to determine the fraction of UVB light that will reach the skin over time. For example, if a person were to burn without sun protection after 5 minutes of sun exposure, SPF 10 would protect the same person in the same exposure for 50 minutes.,SPF does not take into account UVA rays, which although not responsible for sunburn, do also lead to skin cancer. Broad-spectrum modern suncreams contain protection against both UVA and UVB.,Among the most effective reflectors against UVA radiation are minerals like zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. The latter has been produced in huge quantities by the chemical industry since the early twentieth century as white pigment for paint.,Initially these minerals were used as a thick white paste in sunblock, but some modern sun creams now contain nano-particles, which mean they are both more effective and less paste-y.,Recently, there has been a fashionable trend towards ‘natural’, ‘clean’ and dermatological sun lotion, Gwyneth Paltrow-endorsed products are presenting titanium dioxide as novel minerals to the industry. But as this bottle of the stuff from the mid-1960s shows, it is nothing new under the sun.,Learn more about humanity’s relationship with our nearest star in

In recent years there has been a movement to demystify menstruation, and people have been speaking more openly about the topic.,,Campaigns have been launched to challenge the taxes placed on menstrual products in Britain since they were first classified as ‘non-essential items’ in 1973.

I covered an attempt in 2008
, when just three telescopes combined to gaze into the maw of the black hole that sits at the heart of our own galaxy, an enigmatic source of radio waves called Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*).,Today, in simultaneous global press conferences, Dr Sheperd Doeleman, Harvard University Senior Research Fellow, described how the
Event Horizon Telescope
, named after a black hole’s point of no return, combined signals from eight telescopes to create an Earth-sized virtual telescope capable of resolving a structure as small as an orange on the moon.,‘Black holes are the most mysterious objects in the universe,’ said Dr Doeleman, EHT Director, adding that in the case of M87, as a result of today’s ‘extraordinary scientific feat…we have seen the unseeable.’,The results are published in the
Astrophysical Journal Letters
.,M87 is at the centre of the Virgo galaxy, a behemoth with a mass 6.5 billion times that of the Sun, located 54 million light-years away from Earth, which also spews out a jet of energy thousands of light-years across space.,Dr Doeleman, Dr Jonathan Weintroub and colleagues used a technique called Very Long Baseline Interferometry to combine the data from eight observatories to study radio wavelengths that can penetrate the gas and dust that shroud the heart of galaxies.,They have also gathered data on Sgr A*, which is about the size of the orbit of Mercury, of mass about four million times that of our sun, and light from its surroundings takes 25,000 years to reach Earth.,However, because SgrA* is so much less massive (1500 times) than M87 ‘the timescale of variability for Sgr A* is about 20 minutes or variable over the time scale of an observation,’ said Dr Weintroub. ‘This makes the imaging more challenging because we depend on it staying static as the Earth rotates.,‘Which isn’t to say we’ve given up on SgrA*, very much to the contrary, but that’s why we focused on M87 first, which wasn’t easy either, but the better one on which to start.’,The existence of the Sgr A* black hole was predicted in 1971 by Lord Rees, Astronomer Royal, with Donald Lynden Bell. Today, the cores of largest galaxies are thought to harbour supermassive black holes and, though impressed by today’s M87 results, Lord Rees said he was disappointed not to see more details of the jet.,Nearby stars
have been seen to orbit around black holes
, an indirect clue to the existence of these gravitational monsters, while at the event horizon of the black hole space-time itself bends to the point where even light can’t escape.,The boggling gravity of a black hole gobbles up dust, gas and light from its surroundings into a disc around itself, eventually pulling this material over its event horizon and into oblivion.,The black holes are rendered visible as a shadow backlit by the accretion disk of material, where heat and light are generated, spiralling into the black hole.,The way a black hole wraps light around the event horizon in accordance with one of Einstein’s most famous predictions – the bending of starlight by a massive body in space – was first confirmed by Sir Arthur Eddington’s measurements
during the 1919 solar eclipse
, the results of which
turned Einstein into a global superstar
. In theory, space-time is warped so strongly that one can see behind the black hole.,At the most basic level, the 200 or more scientists of the Event Horizon Telescope want to answer two questions. The first is to take an image of a black hole, since ‘seeing is believing’. The second is whether Einstein’s predictions of the size and the shape of the black hole’s shadow hold up.,They might be circular, oval or some other shape, depending on circumstances which, if confirmed, is dull for theoreticians. However, if the Einsteinian equations describing them are askew, the research could open the door to new physics.,In the case of M87, the results were consistent but ‘this is just the beginning,’ said Dr Doeleman.,‘Once we were sure we had imaged the shadow, we could compare our observations to extensive computer models that include the physics of warped space, superheated matter and strong magnetic fields. Many of the features of the observed image match our theoretical understanding surprisingly well,’ remarked Paul T.P. Ho, EHT Board member and Director of the East Asian Observatory. ‘This makes us confident about the interpretation of our observations, including our estimation of the black hole’s mass.’,This ‘herculean task’ has resulted in a ‘historic moment,’ said National Science Foundation Director,
France Córdova
, explaining that it would ‘transform and enhance our understanding of black holes.’,One of the best simulations of what to expect can be found in the Hollywood movie
Interstellar
, which Kip Thorne, Feynman Professor of Theoretical Physics Emeritus at Caltech, worked with Paul Franklin of the British company Double Negative to show, as Thorne put it, ‘image distortion akin to a fun-house warped mirror.’,Thorne shared the Nobel Prize in 2017 for the observation of another prediction of Einstein’s general relativity, that gravitational waves – ripples in space-time – are generated by violent cosmic events, such as when two black holes collide.
A prototype component of the Advanced LIGO
(Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory) gravitational wave detector made by the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Chilton, can be seen in the Science Museum.,Anticipated as ‘dark stars’ (stars so big that light cannot escape) in the 1700s by the English clergyman
John Michell
, black holes are among the more extraordinary predictions of Einstein’s
theory of general relativity
, one that links space, time and gravity, one of the greatest accomplishments of the human mind.,Originally, black holes were just one mathematical solution to Einstein’s field equations. But in the 1930s, the Nobel Prize winning astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar showed that black holes were an inevitable consequence of a star’s death, and scientists started considering them real objects.,The late
Stephen Hawking
is another key figure in the story of black holes. He first caught the attention of his peers in the late 1960s, working with Roger Penrose on how general relativity sometimes breaks down, resulting in what is called a singularity. They showed that such singularities must occur inside black holes – and, most probably, at the start of the universe.,One of Hawking’s overarching goals was to take general relativity, which can be used to predict the large scale structure of the universe, and blend it with quantum theory, which rules the world of atoms and the very small, to produce a grand theory of everything, known as quantum gravity.,In his most famous work, Hawking raised the intriguing possibility that black holes are not as black as once thought. The reason is down to one strange consequence of quantum theory: empty space isn’t empty: pairs of particles are constantly popping into and out of existence. If they appear on the border of event horizon, they may find themselves on different sides, with one sucked in, and the other becoming ‘Hawking radiation’.,If the paradoxical glow of Hawking radiation had been detected from a black hole during his lifetime, Hawking could well have won the Nobel Prize. But, as Lord Rees remarked, this could not have been detected in the images released today because the effect is inversely related to mass and it ‘would only be seen from black holes smaller than an atom, which nobody really expects to exist.’,On his 70
th
birthday, the Science Museum gave Hawking a special present, a
‘black hole light’
, and at his
memorial service
at
Westminster Abbey
on 15th June 2018, his gravestone was unveiled which bears the Hawking’s equation that expresses Hawking radiation."

But using science to help solve crimes is not as easy as it looks on TV. While advancements in forensic science have made the justice system fairer, they have also created ethical issues about what can be used as evidence in court.,Forensic scientists use genetic profiling to analyse the DNA they find at crime scenes. This technique was developed in 1984 at the University of Leicester by
Dr Alec Jeffreys
. We all share more than 99% of our DNA but we each have small variations that make us unique.,Dr Jeffreys discovered that many of these differences occur in certain parts of our DNA, called microsatellites. When forensic scientists look at several of these microsatellites at once, they can create a genetic profile, or fingerprint. They can use this to tell how likely it is that the DNA found at a crime scene came from a certain person.,When forensic DNA analysis was first used in the 1980s, scientists needed a sample of bodily fluid, like blood, the size of a 20p coin to create a genetic fingerprint. Since then, the sample size needed has gotten smaller and smaller.,Forensic scientists can now create a genetic profile using the tiny amounts of DNA that we sometimes leave behind when we touch things. This is called touch, or trace, DNA.,This technique has meant that DNA evidence can be used in more investigations and has already helped to solve decades-old cold cases in the United States. But it has also made interpreting forensic science more complicated.,When genetic profiling was first used for forensics, Dr Alec Jeffreys warned that his technique could not prove whether or not someone was guilty. It could only show that a DNA sample likely came from a certain person. He advised that it was up to the courts to determine how or why a suspect’s DNA came to be at a crime scene.,Advancements in touch DNA techniques mean that our DNA can be found in places we’ve never been, including crime scenes. Our DNA can be passed to other people when we shake their hand or pass them money. It can also become mixed with other people’s DNA, making it difficult for scientists to pull them apart.,A study done by UCL suggested that forensic evidence was misinterpreted in more than 20% of criminal cases that were overturned in the UK over the last seven years. Forensic scientists have warned that it is important for the courts to understand how DNA analysis works and what it can tell them. It has also been suggested that some jurors may be influenced by the “CSI effect” and have unrealistic expectations about what forensic science can show.,While forensic science has made the justice system more objective, it is important that it be used fairly. As forensic techniques become more advanced, they can be used to help solve more crimes. But they could also become more difficult to interpret.,Discover the forensic investigation into the murder of the Romanovs in

In doing so, it complicated anatomical models by the second-century Greek physician Galen, which had been accepted – and revered – for centuries.,The eighteenth-century part of the collection also includes several visual show-stoppers.

: some have suggested that the corpses of pregnant women may have been acquired illegitimately or violently, whilst others have argued that the figures may not all have been copied from corpses, but from anatomical models. Another theory is that the artists responsible for the images – who also illustrated other obstetrical texts – may have used their previous artistic experience to produce some drawings.,When including books like this in a collection or exhibition, it is important to recognise the multitude of human stories they tell: the stories of those involved in their production, dissemination and reception deserve acknowledgement.,A handwritten memorandum describing which books the Museum Library wished to add to its collection recognised this human element. Probably dating from the 1990s, this informal note lists several kinds of scientific book that the Library was – or had been – interested in collecting. The first category, called ‘landmarks’, describes books that had a momentous impact on the development of science. But the note says that the Library was no longer so concerned with acquiring these, because it already possessed a large number.,Instead, it was turning its attention to books that were ‘less well-known […] but significant in their field’ and books of ‘“professional” quality not enormously innovative or original’. Here the Library recognised that works that helped scientific practitioners, technicians and tradespeople do their jobs in day-to-day life were just as important to our understanding of how scientific knowledge was transmitted as ‘landmarks’ like Vesalius’s work.,In my own research, I have encountered books worthy of attention for different reasons. Some were printed and revised a surprisingly large number of times, suggesting popularity in their own era. For example, a seemingly unremarkable pamphlet on scrofula written by John Morley, a gentleman from Essex, is not visually stunning; it contains only one illustrated plate. But it was revised or reprinted at least 42 times between 1760 and 1824.,Others display evidence of being highlights in individual lives. For instance, a copy of John Hill’s eighteenth-century
British Herbal
is prefaced with a note revealing that, in 1898, a father gave the herbal as a Christmas present to his daughter Molly.,Similarly, an eighteenth-century botanical text by William Woodville is signed by the nineteenth-century missionary John Barton in the same year that he graduated from Cambridge with honours in mathematics and natural sciences.,So, what we can learn by looking closer at such collections is that all of these books – whatever their shape or size – can have interesting human stories to tell.,Find out more about Hannah’s pop-up display

",Science in the news,"dna,history,the last tsar","Over 70 years after the night Tsar Nicholas II and his family were killed, the investigation into their murders was still open. No-one had found their bodies. But in 1991 some remains were excavated close to where they died, and a new part of the investigation began.,At this time I was working at the UK’s
Forensic Science Service
, the premier laboratory working on forensic identification with DNA technology. In 1984 Alec Jeffreys provided the first demonstration of DNA profiling, which showed people have DNA characteristics unique to them, just like fingerprints. A year later, in 1985, I worked with Alec at Leicester University on the first demonstration of DNA profiling applied to forensic-type materials like old blood stains. We also demonstrated that we could analyse very small or degraded samples of DNA to find someone’s DNA fingerprint.,I first met Russian scientist Pavel Ivanov at a scientific conference in 1992, and he asked me if I was interested in working with him to study the remains using DNA profiling techniques. I was interested, but this kind of study had never been done before and we didn’t know if it was possible to achieve any results from such old samples. Bones that had been buried for over 70 years would be very difficult to extract DNA from, as it degrades over time. But I knew this was an opportunity I didn’t want to turn down, and the UK Home Office supported our work.,I still remember meeting Pavel at Heathrow Airport arrivals – there was intense media interest and swarms of journalists were present. Pavel carried the bones from Russia and we transferred them to the Forensic Science Service, where the work began.,A small team of scientists worked with me and Pavel on the remains – Kevin Sullivan, Gillian Tully, Colin Kimpton, Nicola Benson and Romelle Piercy. We thought that the main problem we would face was ‘contamination’. Since the bones were discovered they had been handled by lots of different people. DNA is present in sweat, skin cells and saliva, so their DNA could be present on the bones as well.,We developed strict quality protocols to deal with this. We all wore clean lab coats and facemasks to prevent saliva spray while talking. To remove any modern DNA from the surface of the bones we filed them with sandpaper and took a small section of bone for analysis. As expected, we could only find very small amounts of DNA present in the bones. Each sample contained DNA originating from just half a dozen cells.,To determine if the remains belonged to the Romanovs, we needed to compare them to samples from verified relatives. We were fortunate to obtain blood samples from HRH Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, who is a direct descendant of the Tsarina Alexandra. Samples were also obtained from the Duke of Fife and Princess Xenia Cheremeteff Sfiri, who are related to the Tsar. The remains matched their living royal relatives and we therefore knew we had found the bones of the Romanovs.,But this wasn’t the end of the story. Other scientists were surprised we’d been able to obtain any DNA from such old remains, and a very small section of the Tsar’s DNA sequence didn’t match his living relatives. We worked for another year to verify our results, but some still considered our findings controversial. A number of different groups of scientists in the USA and Russia worked to confirm or discount our results. One group even exhumed the body of the Tsar’s brother, George, from the St Petersburg cathedral. But each new test confirmed our original findings.,Our work identifying the Tsar’s remains helped to create the
UK national DNA database
and accelerated the development of new methods for forensic testing with small samples of DNA. Today these are used around the world in forensic investigations by the police and have been used to solve thousands of criminal cases.,This blog was written alongside our free exhibition The Last Tsar: Blood and Revolution, exploring the life and death of Tsar Nicholas II and his family and the forensic investigation into their murder.

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/tuberculosis-a-fashionable-disease/,Imogen Clarke,Tuberculosis: A Fashionable Disease?,"Tuberculosis has existed for thousands of years, and throughout its long history has been shrouded in myth and mystery.","At the Museum,Collections and Objects,Exhibitions and Galleries","fashion,history,medicine,medicine galleries","More than any other disease, it shaped and infused the social history of the 19th century. Its complexity, accompanied by a lack of scientific knowledge at the time, led to a paradoxical state of beauty and death.,Tuberculosis is contagious and spreads most frequently through the air when an individual with active TB coughs or spits. The disease most commonly affects the lungs, but can affect other parts of the body, often progressing slowly with symptoms potentially not manifesting until months or even years after initial infection.,Classic symptoms of tuberculosis of the lungs include fevers, night sweats, weight loss, and infamously – chronic coughing and the spitting of sputum containing blood. Weight loss and the so-called ‘wasting away’ associated with TB led to the popular 19th century name of consumption, as the disease was seen to be consuming the individual.,Although the earliest evidence of tuberculosis can be found in human remains over 9000 years old, it wasn’t until the 19th and early 20th centuries that the disease reached its peak.,Commonplace overcrowding and poor sanitation in industrialised countries meant the disease thrived, and tuberculosis became the primary cause of death among the urban working classes.,But consumption was by no means an exclusive illness of the poor. Its easy method of transmission meant it crossed class boundaries and affected people at all levels of society.,The drastic and damaging effects of this disease are undeniable, with nearly 4 million people said to have died as a result in England and Wales between 1851 and 1910. Three-quarters of those from tuberculosis of the lungs.,And yet despite this, throughout the romantic era and into the late 19th century, tuberculosis forged a unique place in society and became entwined with ideas of beauty and creativity.,Numerous artistic figures contracted TB, shaping public perception of the disease. Famously the poet John Keats, who had trained as a medical man, declared on seeing his blood-stained handkerchief after a coughing fit, that it was his death sentence: “I cannot be deceived in that colour; – that drop of blood is my death-warrant; – I must die.”,Romantic poet Lord Byron wished to die of consumption, declaring: “How pale I look! – I should like, I think, to die of consumption … because then the women would all say, ‘see that poor Byron – how interesting he looks in dying!’”,Famed creatives such as Keats became powerful symbols of the disease. They were seen to be of heightened sensibility, and it was thought that their work was elevated because of consumption’s effect on the mind.,When TB attacked young women of the upper classes, it was treated decidedly differently than when it struck the poor. Unlike other serious illnesses of the time, pulmonary tuberculosis was associated with fragility and sexual attractiveness.,The consumptive appearance entailed dramatically pale skin, an ethereal thinness, with red cheeks and a feverish glow. This became the defining fashionable aesthetic of the time with women powdering their faces, some even using chemicals such as arsenic to achieve a paler complexion.,This obsession with the ‘consumptive aesthetic’ peaked in the mid-1800s, when corsets and voluminous skirts further emphasized women’s slender figures with damaging implications for women’s physical health and social roles. The restrictive nature of the corset made all but the smallest of physical tasks challenging, and excessive use could lead to displacement of internal organs.,This traditional consumptive look was perpetuated throughout popular culture with famous portraits, novels, plays and operas telling tales of ethereally thin and beautiful women teeteringly close to death, or inspired creatives overcome with the disease. Alexandre Dumas’ 1848 novel La Dame aux Camélias (commonly known as Camille), was later adapted into an opera with character Marguerite Gautier clutching her blood-spotted handkerchief in a prelude to her death.,This consumptive cultural trope has continued through to the modern day, meaning we’re now almost trained to recognise the coughing of blood into a handkerchief in act 1 meaning the inevitable death of that character by act 3!,Robert Koch’s discovery of the
tubercle basillus
in 1882 was a major event in the history of medicine.,After centuries of speculation, Koch proved that the slow-growing microorganism
Mycobacterium Tuberculosis
caused the disease and established its contagious nature. The cause of so much death was boiled down to this single-celled living organism.,Once the cause of TB had been identified, its severity and contagious nature became better understood. As the century progressed, the disease, once so clouded in romantic imagery and mystery, was revealed to be much more prosaic. Romantic portrayals and perceptions of consumption were gradually replaced with scientific facts, and the once-mysterious disease was transformed into a public health problem."

th
December 1980 was a big day for the Science Museum. With the opening of a new floor showcasing the history of medicine –
Glimpses of Medical History
– we changed from a museum of the physical sciences and of technology, to one that also embraced medicine and biomedical research. This gallery provided a visual feast of dioramas and room sets showing medical instruments and techniques in context – from medieval medicine preparation to battlefield surgery.,A year later, on 18
th
December 1981 another new gallery on another new floor followed.
The Science and Art of Medicine
displayed a treasure trove of historic objects relating to health and the practice of medicine – from folk remedies to the world’s first stethoscope.,What led us to that point was the 1976 transfer of the extraordinary collection of
Sir Henry Wellcome
on permanent loan from the Wellcome Trust to the Science Museum. A century earlier, in the 1870s American businessman Henry Wellcome had begun to collect things relating to all aspects of medicine and human health. He found the topic so vast and varied that he could never find its limits. By his death in 1936 he’d amassed so many things that they filled several warehouses and ‘the strangest museum in the world’ – the
Wellcome Historical Medical Museum
at 54a Wigmore Street, London.,The custodianship of Wellcome’s collection and the creation of the Science Museum’s first galleries devoted to medicine invigorated our collecting in this area. The Science Museum’s medicine collections now contain over 140,000 objects with major acquisitions since 1976 including the Roehampton Collection of prosthetic limbs (see image below), the world’s first MRI scanner and the operating table on which King George VI had lung surgery.,And now a new era beckons.,We are developing major new Medicine Galleries to showcase thousands of objects from our medicine collections for the next generation. Thanks to leadership funding from the
Wellcome Trust
, the
Heritage Lottery Fund
and the
Wolfson Foundation
, these six new galleries will open in 2019, transforming much of the first floor of the Museum and putting the history of medicine and biomedical research at the heart of the Science Museum. In preparation for this major redisplay
Glimpses of Medical History
and
The Science and Art of Medicine
will close to the public on Sunday 20
th
September.,We will be busy conserving many of our objects ready for the new galleries, but while this is happening you’ll still be able to see highlights from the collection in a new exhibition,

bad metaphors and innuendos
, as I learnt this week at Blythe House.,In a dark corner of the Science Museum’s storage facility sits a small, awkward-looking wooden box with intriguing glass pipes sprouting out of it.,However, this unassuming little object just so happens to be one of the world’s last remaining pyrophones, an instrument which, as the name suggests, combines fire and sound!,Patented by the Strasbourg-born musician and scientist Fréderic Kastner in 1873, the pyrophone was a musical instrument in which flames encased in pipes similar to those of a traditional organ were used to produce musical notes.,Kaster took advantage of Dr B Higgins’ 1777 discovery that a hydrogen flame positioned at the lower end of glass tube could produce a note and combined this with his musical knowledge (his father was the composer Georges Kastner) in order to produce a “Fire Organ”, as the instrument was also known.,This name perhaps suits the device better than pyrophone, as it did in fact function much like any other organ, with the size and shape of the pipes regulating the note’s pitch and a keyboard acting as the musical interface.,The only real difference is that the pyrophone’s notes were produced not by air pressure, but through a quirk of combustion first discovered by Higgins.,Sadly, the pyrophone and its cousins the Electrical Singing Lustre and the Electrical Singing Candelabra did not set the musical world alight (with excitement).,Both Hector Berlioz and Cesar Franck visited Kastner in order to try the pyrophone, and Charles Gounod considered using it in a production of
Jeanne d’Arc
, but in general, the public’s reaction to the instrument was somewhat underwhelming.,The only composer to actually write any music specifically for the instrument was Theodore Lack who wrote several pieces, including an arrangement of
God, Save the Queen
that was later performed publicly.,Kastner wrote a book about his instrument and The Times also paid the pyrophone some attention, but the instrument’s success was limited.,To discover more about the pyrophone, its bizarre conection with the Red Cross and how it found its way into the Science Museum you’ll have to read the second part of

Ben Russell, lead curator of the ‘Robots’ exhibition.,,The Last Supper, an art installation by artist Giles Walker © The Board of Trustees of the Science MuseumArtist and sculptor Giles Walker created the artwork in 2011 after the death of his mother and the piece draws inspiration from questions around the meaning of religion and mortality. Twelve seated figures are arranged around a table in a mirroring of Leonardo Da Vinci’s iconic painting
The Last Supper
. As the installation commences the effect is one of a sinister crew aboard a ship. The figures’ conversations vary from musings on life and death to recordings of the last meals ordered by inmates on death row –  which provide an oddly touching element to the piece, memorable in their strange banality.,Known for creating art from recycled materials Walker has combined an interest in re-purposing objects with kinetic technology for this unique installation.
The Last Supper
uses an immersive mix of animatronics and audio effects to create a world within the gallery space. By combining theological questions about the nature of good and evil with semi-human animatronic figures Walker has created an unsettling, evocative piece that will stay with you long after it ends."

UK engineering is facing serious skills shortages, and addressing diversity and inclusion will not only help bridge this gap, it will also help ensure that the people who are designing and building the world around us are more reflective of our society.’,Maja Pantic, Professor of Affective and Behavioral Computing at Imperial College London, said her native Serbia has much higher rates of female participation in science, technology, engineering and mathematics than the UK, putting this down to differences in cultural heritage and beliefs.

is the Particle Detector as you can see the remnants of exploding stars, allowing us to see things that would otherwise remain invisible. Particle detectors also reveal the physics behind many other things such as the science of cloud condensation and the nature of radiation.,,I love spending time at the Thermal Camera. It “sees” temperature which means that we can play with it in many ways: try eating an ice cream or drinking a hot tea in front of the camera and you may be amazed at how the colour of your mouth will change on screen. It also lends itself well to playing with materials: a foil first aid blanket can hide you from the camera’s view like a Cloak of Invisibility!,,I love our orbits demonstration – our model of how the Earth and the Moon move around the Sun. I think this is a great exhibit because we can show how we get day and night, and the phases of the Moon. We can use this demo to show where days, months and years come from.,I enjoy discussing the discovery of new exoplanets, which are planets orbiting other stars. I also love learning and talking about the work scientists are doing everyday aboard the International Space Station.,For more information on space exploration, come and check out the Space area of Wonderlab, or see our fantastic
Rocket Show
in the Showspace!,,My favourite exhibit in Wonderlab is Visible Vibrations. In this exhibit you can use sound to make the water in the tube jump in amazing patterns which actually let you see the shape of the sound waves in the tube. I love this exhibit because it shows how all woodwind and brass musical instruments work. The science behind it is easy to understand but it has a massive range of applications and is great fun to explain. It is part of the sound section in Wonderlab which is great fun to explore.,Whether you’re interested in chemistry, love maths or just want to experience the thrill of trying one of our gigantic friction slides, Wonderlab has something for everyone!,Wonderlab: The Equinor Gallery

Associate Curator of Chemistry Rupert Cole explores the Curies’ discovery and its legacy.,At the Museum,medicine,"Boxing day, a holiday named by the Victorians after the tradition of giving a ‘Christmas box’ – a gift or money – to the less fortunate.,Today, it might be marked by left-over-turkey sandwiches and general rest from the previous day’s festivities and feasting.,Not so for the Curies. 120 years ago, on 26 December 1898, Marie and her husband Pierre Curie announced the discovery of a new element, which they christened ‘radium’.,Their discovery was relayed to the French Academy of Sciences by Henri Becquerel, who two years earlier had discovered radioactivity, the process by which heavy, unstable atoms decay, emitting radiation.,The Curies’ Boxing-day paper noted the ‘radioactivity of radium … must be enormous’, having not yet managed to fully isolate the element.,They weren’t wrong. Radium is about a million times more radioactive than uranium. A white, luminescent substance, when radium is heated it gives off an eerie blue-green glow – over Christmas 1898 the Curies enjoyed watching this light in the evening.,‘We had an especial joy,’ Marie Curie recalled.’ These gleamings … in the darkness, stirred us with ever new emotion and enchantment’. Radium seems to have been a pretty festive Christmas present, the extent of its danger not known at the time.,The Science Museum has in its collection a flask used by Marie Curie to hold radium. The glass has been discoloured by radiation.,1898 was a big year for the Curies. Eight months earlier they discovered their first new element, ‘polonium’, named after Marie Curie’s home country Poland. These radioactive elements marked the beginning of a new epoch in chemistry and physics.,The Curies were also were raising their newly-born daughter Irène. On 17 October 1898, Marie remarked in her diary proudly she ‘can walk very well, and no longer goes on all fours’.,Following in the footsteps of her parents, Irène Joliot-Curie would win the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for discovering ‘artificial chemistry’.,The laboratory the Curies worked in were far from glamourous. Little more than a shed in a backstreet of Paris, the conditions by which they laboriously isolated a tenth of a gram of radium from one tonne of pitchblende, a uranium ore, proved detrimental to their health.,However, ‘it was in this miserable old shed’, Curie later reminisced, ‘that we passed the best and happiest years of our lives’.,After another year of hard work on radium, they took a well-earned bicycle holiday along the Channel coast of France, from Harve to St Valéry-sur-Somme.,Their discovery of radium caused immediate excitement in the scientific world, and soon also among the public, as a new industry of radium emerged anda vast range of products, from toothpaste to shoe polish, were sold advertising radium as the new wonder cure for health.,The Science Museum has some interesting examples of radium products, including this English soap made with ‘radium spa mud’.,In true Christmas spirit, the Curies never patented or sold their hugely-profitable element, sending out free samples.,After winning her second Nobel prize in 1911 (the first person to do so), Marie Curie established with her winnings the Institut du Radium (now the Curie Institute) in Paris. At the facility, she taught nurses radiology during the First World War.,It is now one the leading centres in the world for medical research and cancer treatment.,Radium has had a legacy Father Christmas himself would be proud of."

We asked what their favourite object was and why they chose it. Read on for a look at the people and the objects that make the Museum such a unique place.,Guinevere, 1994 from
Mathematics: The Winton Gallery
:,Dominique,
Masterplan Collections Assistant,,“I have a personal connection with ‘Guinevere’ as I installed it back in October 2016 for
Mathematics: The Winton Gallery
at the Science Museum. The task that ‘Guinevere’ performs is an ancient statistical task that we’ve had the technology to do for thousands of years. I love that despite the mechanical simplicity of ‘Guinevere’ when the UK’s National Lottery was first broadcast, millions of viewers were glued to their television sets with all eyes focused on those famous brightly coloured balls.”,People have been playing games of chance since before recorded history. Archaeologists have found evidence that early people used certain animal bones as rudimentary dice. But it was not until the 17th century that the mathematics of chance was understood. It is no coincidence that the world’s most talented mathematicians often used the throw of the dice to help work out the complexities of probability theory. Gambling helped them think through their mathematical ideas. We have been playing the National Lottery in the UK since 1994, when Prime Minister John Major set up the money-raising scheme and the BBC broadcast the first weekly draws using machines like ‘Guinevere’.,,The Chemistry Bar from
Wonderlab: The Equinor Gallery
:,Liz,
Explainer,,“The Chemistry Bar in
Wonderlab: The Equinor Gallery
is my favourite part of  the gallery. When I was studying Marine Biology at university I realised how fundamental chemistry is to informing our understanding of the world. Be it how organisms in the deep ocean live off the process chemosynthesis rather than photosynthesis, or even just what chemical compounds make up the world around us. At the Chemistry Bar we offer the opportunity to literally hold chemistry in your hands – it’s an unforgettable experience and inspires people to be curious and learn more. It’s also my favourite place in the Museum as I get to do what I love – presenting and interacting with the public, and even though I’m an Explainer I always learn something new from our visitors too.”,Wonderlab: The Equinor Gallery
is the UK’s biggest interactive science gallery. The permanent gallery features unique exhibits, specially-commissioned artworks, explosive demonstrations and immersive experiences led by the Museum’s talented team of science communicators, Explainers, to inspire visitors of all ages to wonder at the science and mathematics that shape our lives. With over 50 exhibits across seven zones, visitors to the gallery will explore the incredible phenomena that occur around us every day, with topics as diverse as sound, forces, light, electricity, maths, matter and space.
Wonderlab
is also home to three live demonstration areas (including the Chemistry Bar) and a 120-capacity showspace inspired by the Royal Institution’s world-renowned Faraday Theatre.,,Ford Model-T, 1916 from
Making the Modern World
:,Steve,
Security Officer,,“The ‘Ford Model T’ is a special object for me as the gallery it’s housed in
Making the Modern World
is the first one I worked in within the Museum. I’ve always had a personal connection with Ford cars, the first car I ever bought was a Ford! When my parents first moved to London from the West Indies the company everyone wanted to work for was Ford, so this object also reminds me of them and the start of their new lives in the UK.”,With the Model T car Henry Ford established the manufacturing system that made his name a byword for mass production. His vast Highland Park plant in Detroit, USA, was one of the industrial wonders of the 20th century and was visited by political leaders and industrialists from around the world. Ford declared, ‘the man who places a part does not fasten it … the man who puts on the nut does not tighten it’.,Through this ruthless subdivision of labour, and by applying mass production techniques on a vast scale, the Ford company created, with the Model T, a simple and affordable car. This brought motoring within the reach of a huge new market. Every step was taken to simplify and speed up production, including the decision in 1914 to paint cars only in black. The design was first introduced in 1908 and, by 1927, when the Model T was phased out, over 15 million had been produced. This was the largest production run of any car design in the first half of the 20th century.,,Willans triple-expansion engine, c.1887 from the
Energy Hall
:,Fergus,
Volunteer,,“I’ve loved coming to the Science Museum ever since my grandfather took me here as a child. He was an engineer and shared his passion for his work with me. I’ve also always been interested in design and the different ways you can use materials to create something new. ‘Willans triple-expansion engine’ is my favourite object as I suppose it combines these two subjects but also it shows the ingenuity people are capable of. I love the sheer complexity of the design but also the determination of engineers like Willans to create more efficient energy sources. Even today, processes like this that harness steam power are used across the energy sector from nuclear power to coal and gas.”,The Energy Hall traces the remarkable story of steam and how it shaped the world we live in today. Steam has been the driving force behind British industry for 300 years. Without it, the Industrial Revolution could never have happened. Even now, steam provides 75% of the electricity we use every day. Willans central-valve engines were mainly used in early electricity generating stations. This one was built according to Peter Willans’ patent of 1884 and he used it as an experimental engine. It is full size and cut open so you can see how it worked. Engines like these were later replaced by steam engines."

Far from the shouty, childish efforts of today, they were clever, satirical shows with cutting-edge stage technology creating sensational spectacles.,Many Victorian pantos took on science themes. One particularly spectacular effort was the L
and of Light
, or
Harlequin Gas and the Four Elements
. Opening at the Victoria Theatre (now the Old Vic) on Boxing Day 1848, it made artificial gas light its subject.,The pantomime begins in a coal mine 5000-miles below the surface of the earth where a group of banished fairies complain they are no longer liked in a society of science and modern improvement.,They are joined by the personification of Science, who challenges the fairies to a contest of traditional panto magic.,Science’s first trick is to combust a slab of coal – the stage directions here are brilliant, indicating a ‘player’ emerges from a giant lump of coal with ‘a flame upon his head’. This might be the only instance in the history of the panto where a chemical process is the subject of a scene.,For the finale, Science transports everyone to the ‘Land of Light’, cue a dazzling illumination of camphine, budelight and limelight – all very explosive gases. Theatres in Victorian London regularly burnt down. It is a marvel the Victoria didn’t that night.,The Land of Light’s playwright, E. L. Blanchard, penned many pantos with science themed. He was prolific, responsible for every Drury Lane pantomime for 35 years.,Blanchard began his career as a travelling popular science lecturer, specialising in oxyhydrogen-microscope display.,These projection microscopes utilised the powerful light from burning a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen gas. They could enlarge a flea to the size of an elephant.,Catering to a demand for a more wholesome form of ‘rational recreation’ than the rowdy theatres, two London galleries of ‘practical science’ opened in the 1830s.,The Adelaide Gallery and the
Polytechnic Institution
(now the University of Westminster) were known for spectacular demonstrations, from your standard stinks and explosions to diving bells and giant electrical coils.,They were great rivals during the Christmas season. One year, the Adelaide put on recitals of
Handel’s
Messiah
to oxyhydrogen microscope displays and laughing gas demonstrations.,A reviewer for
The Times
was not impressed:,half-a-dozen of that class of persons who are not inappropriately termed “snobs” inhaled the laughing-gas, and managed […] to make themselves greater fools than nature perhaps designed them to be,The Polytechnic, which boasted its own public laboratory, always outdid the Adelaide. Their professor of chemistry, John Henry Pepper, masterminded the festive programme.,At Christmas 1862 Pepper surpassed himself. He stumbled upon a new kind of stage trick for Christmas, which still bears his name: Pepper’s Ghost.,By shining a limelight upon an actor concealed in a gallery below the stage, an image of the actor would be projected via angled glass into the audience, appearing as if on stage.,For the first public performance of the Ghost illusion, Pepper staged a Dickens short story, The Haunted Man and the Ghost’s Bargain (1848), about a ‘learned man in chemistry’ haunted by his doppelganger.,Dickens’ protagonist was likely inspired by
Michael Faraday
, whose hugely-successful Christmas Lecture series, ‘The chemical history of a candle’, caught the attention of Dickens, the writer later publishing a version of the lecture in his own periodical.,Pepper’s Ghost became one of the most popular Christmas entertainments, attracting the likes of Prince Albert and even Faraday himself.,But in terms of high society, Faraday’s own
Christmas Lectures
were unrivalled. The papers published lists of attendees that read like a Who’s Who of upper-class London. The writer George Eliot deemed them ‘more fashionable than the opera’.,Over the 19 series he gave, Faraday drew on Christmas traditions to illustrate principles of science. In his final ‘Candle’ lecture he played Snap-dragon, a festive parlour game that hasn’t survived.,In the pitch-dark theatre, Faraday covered plums in brandy, set them alight, then tried to pick them up, declaring ‘I do not know a more beautiful illustration of the philosophy of flame’.,The Christmas Lectures are the only surviving relic of this Victorian crossover between science and Christmas.,I probably won’t be trying limelight projections or Handel with laughing gas, but I may give Snap-dragon a go this Christmas…"
https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/winston-churchill-on-alien-life/,Roger Highfield,Winston Churchill on Alien Life,Churchill and the possibility of extra-terrestrial life.,"Exhibitions and Galleries,Science in the news","astronomy,churchill's scientists,space","Director of External Affairs, Roger Highfield, reflects on the recent discovery of an article written by Winston Churchill about the possibility of extra-terrestrial life,,A remarkable glimpse of Churchill’s enduring fascination with science – expressed in a far sighted article he wrote in 1939 about the possibility of extra-terrestrial life – has been discovered.,In the article, Churchill had reasoned about alien life just ‘like a scientist’, comments Mario Livio, an astrophysicist in an
article published in the journal Nature
.,Livio had been shown the 11-page article, ‘Are We Alone in the Universe?’, by the Director of US National Churchill Museum in Fulton, Missouri, Timothy Riley, who had come across it in papers left to the museum by
Emery Reeves
, Churchill’s agent.,Science Museum Curator Emeritus Andrew Nahum, who curated the
Churchill’s Scientists
exhibition that
opened in January 2015
, decided to investigate a few days ago, when approached by the journal for comment, and found that there were two earlier versions of the typewritten essay in the Churchill Archives Centre at the University of Cambridge. “I wish we had found it ourselves in preparing for the exhibition,” he confesses.,The essay had been intended for publication in the News of the World newspaper, along with two others, and had been finished before he became Prime Minister. In the end only the latter two  were published, and in another newspaper, the Sunday Dispatch, in 1942 (though it has since emerged that a shortened version of the alien life article did appear in the Sunday Dispatch on
8 March 1942
),For Nahum, Churchill’s interest in extra-terrestrials was “completely in line with his interest in science.” Aged 22, while on military service in India, Churchill had read Darwin’s
On the Origin of Species
, along with a primer on physics. Churchill also dabbled with leading-edge technology of the day,
likely being the first politician to learn to fly
.,Frederick Lindemann, the eminent physicist who became Churchill’s ‘on tap’ expert and was the first scientific adviser to a British Prime Minister, had once described Churchill as a ‘scientist who had missed his vocation’. While Chancellor, Churchill joked with Lindemann he had wasted a day reading a new popular book on quantum physics instead of working on the Budget.,In the 11-page article found by Riley, with the title ‘Are We Alone in the Universe?’, Churchill discusses the search for extra-terrestrial life.,A cast-iron definition of life remains elusive even today but Churchill made a stab by defining the most important characteristic as the ability to ‘breed and multiply’. After noting that viruses multiply but are hard to categorize as living things, he focuses on ‘comparatively highly organised life’, presumably ranging from bacteria to multi-cellular life.,Making a point that would chime with the agenda of the European Space Agency and NASA today, Churchill writes that ‘every living unit….consists to a very considerable extent’ of water. Churchill then defines what is known today as the ‘Goldilocks’ zone around a star that is potentially habitable, being neither too cold nor too hot, so that liquid water may be present.,He explains how a planet’s temperature depends on its distance from its local star, in our case the Sun, and also points out that its size, and thus gravity, influences its ability to retain atmosphere and water.,Taking these factors together, Churchill speculates that Mars and Venus are the only other places in the Solar System that could harbour life, ruling out recently discovered Pluto for example.,He talks about how changes in the colour of Mars ‘seem to indicate that some form of vegetation – be it only lichen – enlivened the faintly sunlit landscape’. And Venus, with its ‘hothouse atmosphere’ may harbour ‘intellectual beings’ that are unaware of the cosmos unless ‘they have developed some form of aeroplane.’,Decades before the launch of Yuri Gagarin in 1961, he adds that ‘it is conceivable that one day, possibly even in the not very distant future, it may be possible to travel to the moon or even to Venus or Mars.’,He goes on to say that ‘the sun is merely one star in our galaxy, which contains several thousand millions of others’.,Inspired by the discovery of Riley and Livio, Nahum investigated and believes that Churchill must have read
The Mysterious Universe
(1930) by astrophysicist Sir James Jeans because Churchill mentions the mechanism of planet formation suggested by Jeans: a  near-miss of a ‘vagrant star’ with our Sun which tore off gas which then condensed into ‘a series of planets.’,Jeans also speculates in the book about how ‘there are millions of stars in the sky each similar to our sun, and each doubtlessly surrounded, like our sun, by a family of planets on which life may be kept in being by the light and heat received from its sun (p8)’-a speculation which Churchill also echoes.,The Jeans mechanism for planet formation may be rare, which would mean our Solar System may be ‘possibly unique’ and Churchill adds that ‘this speculation depends upon the hypothesis that planets were formed in this way.’,‘Perhaps they were not. We know there are millions of double stars, and if they could be formed, why not planetary systems?’ Thus, he says, ‘I am not sufficiently conceited to think that my sun is the only one with a family of planets.’,Given the immensity of the cosmos, a large fraction of planets that orbit alien stars ‘will be the right size to keep on their surface water and possibly an atmosphere of some sort’ and some will be ‘at the proper distance from their parent sun to maintain a suitable temperature’.This is a remarkably prescient comment given the hundreds of exo-planets -planets orbiting alien stars – that have been discovered in recent years, notably by the
Kepler Space Observatory
.,The essay finishes with Churchill declaring that ‘I, for one, am not so immensely impressed by the success we are making of our civilization here that I am prepared to think we are the only spot in this immense universe which contains living, thinking creatures, or that we are the highest type of mental and physical development which has ever appeared in the vast compass of space and time.’,It is telling that Churchill began his essay not long after the public alarm caused by the 1938 broadcast of the radio drama
The War of The Worlds
in America, an adaptation of the 1898 story by H. G. Wells, who became a friend and whom Churchill regarded as ‘a seer’.,‘Science isn’t a word most people associate with my great-grandfather’ commented Randolph Churchill,
at the launch of the Science Museum exhibition, Churchill’s Scientists
. However, he went on to explain how his great-grandfather had been fascinated with science from a young age.,,Randolph Churchill also cited a prescient 1924 essay asking readers ‘Shall We All Commit Suicide?’ by his great grandfather that speculates about ‘a bomb no bigger than an orange’ with ‘the secret power to destroy a whole block of buildings – nay to concentrate the force of a thousand tons of cordite and blast a township at a stroke’.,As Graham Farmelo, former Science Museum Executive, makes clear in his book Churchill’s Bomb, no other national leader in the second world war had as much knowledge and understanding of modern physics in general, notably quantum mechanics, and the bomb in particular."

James Clerk Maxwell
published his work on light, electricity and magnetism. Our resident physicist, Dr. Harry Cliff, reflects on how Maxwell helped transform the way we live.,Whether you were up with the lark this morning to greet the dawn of the New Year or crawled bleary-eyed from bed after an over-exuberant farewell to 2014, it’s likely that one of the first things you did was to switch on a light or throw open the curtains.,An appropriate way to start what UNESCO has proclaimed as the
International Year of Light
, a 365-day celebration of light science and technologies, inspired by
a number of major scientific anniversaries
that fall this year.,It was 150 years ago today that one of the most important scientific articles of the 19
th
century was published in the
Philosophical Transactions
of the
Royal Society
. Written by the Scottish physicist
James Clerk Maxwell
, it was titled
A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field
, and its contents were to profoundly alter the way we think about light, electricity and magnetism and transform the way we live.,Maxwell
had been grappling with the relationship between electricity and magnetism for a number of years, in particular with a very old and thorny problem: how is it that when I hold a magnet some distance away from a piece of iron, the iron is moved without actually touching the magnet?,This so called ‘action at a distance’ was troubling in a mechanical age when scientists were trying to describe all forces in terms of direct physical contact between physical entities. In Maxwell’s previous work on electromagnetism, he had made an attempt to explain action at a distance using the commonly-accepted existence of an all-pervading invisible fluid, the
luminiferous aether,
full of spinning vortices that transmitted electrical and magnetic forces.,Maxwell
’s great breakthrough in his new paper came from his decision to try to describe electricity and magnetism without worrying very much about the details of what the aether was like. Instead he introduced the concept of the electromagnetic ‘field’, which in his words:,“is that part of space which contains and surrounds bodies in electric or magnetic conditions.”,In other words, the electromagnetic field described the force that would be experienced by an electric charge or magnet when placed close to another charge or magnet. A common experiment at school is to visualise the magnetic field around a bar magnet by sprinkling it with iron filings.,However, whereas today physicists consider the electromagnetic field to have existence in its own right,
Maxwell
still thought of it as an effect of the arrangement of some underlying physical luminferous aether.,Armed with his electromagnetic field concept, Maxwell derived twenty equations that could be used to describe almost any electromagnetic system, and made plain the deep connections between electricity and magnetism. He then applied his equations to describe undulations or waves travelling through the electromagnetic field. His goal was nothing short of explaining the nature of light itself.,What
Maxwell found
was to change the course of science and technology forever. He derived an equation that described a wave of oscillating electric and magnetic fields; little ripples in the electromagnetic field that could even travel through empty space. Calculating the speed with which these ripples would travel, Maxwell found that it agreed precisely with the best measurement of the speed of light. Maxwell concluded:,“The agreement of the results seems to show that light and magnetism are affectations of the same substance, and that light is an electromagnetic disturbance propagated through the field according to electromagnetic laws.”,This was a stunning result, but it would take time for Maxwell’s theory to become widely accepted. The mathematics were so unfamiliar that most physicists were unable to understand, let alone appreciate Maxwell’s work. In 1879 a prize was offered by the Prussian Academy of Science for anyone able to provide experimental verification of Maxwell’s theory.,Experimental support for the theory would not arrive until after Maxwell’s death in 1879 at the age of just 48. In a series of experiments conducted between 1886 and 1888, Heinrich Hertz demonstrated the transmission of electromagnetic waves, proving Maxwell right and opening up a new technological age, one in which electromagnetic signals could be beamed across the planet, radically shrinking the size of the world and allowing communication at a distance never before imagined.,Although
Maxwell
never lived to see the full impact of his work, those who followed in his footsteps transformed the scientific landscape. It was Maxwell’s wave equation that inspired Einstein’s theory of special relativity, which did away with the lumineferous aether and recast the very notions of space and time. Einstein himself kept a framed photograph of Maxwell on the wall of his office, and Maxwell is now widely regarded as one of the greatest physicists to have ever lived, second perhaps only to Isaac Newton and Einstein himself.,I will leave the final word to the 20
th
century quantum physicist Richard Feynman:,“From a long view of the history of the world—seen from, say, ten thousand years from now—there can be little doubt that the most significant event of the 19th century will be judged as Maxwell’s discovery of the laws of electromagnetism. The American Civil War will pale into provincial insignificance in comparison with this important scientific event of the same decade.”,Find out more about how Maxwell’s work opened up a new age of telecommunication in the Science Museum’s new

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/redefining-the-kilogram/,Jane Desborough,Redefining the kilogram,"This week, the kilogram will be redefined. But what does this mean for scientists and engineers, and for those of us beyond the science lab? Dr Jane Desborough, Curator of Scientific Instruments, explains more.","At the Museum,Research,Science in the news","engineering,physics,Tomorrow's World","[See the UK kilogram and a Kibble Balance on display in
Tomorrow’s World
from 15 November 2018.],On Friday 16 November 2018 the kilogram will be redefined by an internal community of metrologists (scientists of measurement) at the General Conference on Weights and Measures in Versailles. Since 1889, scientists around the world have used the International Prototype kilogram (IPK), made and held in Paris, as their reference for precision measurement of mass. Now, thanks to the pioneering work of scientists at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) and the global metrology community, scientists will be able to use a special kind of balance, known as the Kibble Balance, to determine a kilogram more accurately.,The main reason for the redefinition is to move away from using a physical object as a point of reference for scientific measurement, and to make units of measurement more robust for use in the twenty-first century and beyond. The problem with a physical object is that it is liable to change over time due to environmental factors.  While change would be negligible for daily use outside the confines of the laboratory, for those scientists and engineers working at the extreme levels, even minimal increases and decreases have the potential to impact their work. Indeed, the IPK has been monitored over time and has been shown to have changed.,In everyday life, taking and using measurements with factory-calibrated, shop-bought tools and instruments is sufficient, but for scientists and engineers working at the nano or ten thousand kilogram levels, precision is key. They need to know that a kilogram in the UK is exactly the same as a kilogram in Brazil and Japan and that this has not and will not change.,This has previously been achieved by the International System of Units, known as the SI and formally administered by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) in outer Paris.  BIPM has also been the home of the International Prototype kilogram (IPK) since 1889, when it was approved as the standard from which the unit of mass was then disseminated, through authenticated copies, around the world by the first General Conference on Weights and Measures. It is a cylindrical object made from an alloy of 90% platinum and 10% iridium. The NPL holds the United Kingdom’s national prototype of the kilogram.,Scientists from national measurement institutes (such as NPL) from all over the world continue to meet at BIPM regularly to agree upon the definitions of the base units and in 2014 it was agreed that the seven base units (second, metre, kilogram, ampere, kelvin, mole, candela) would be redefined.,In daily life the way we measure and the way we talk about measurement will not change.  The seven base quantities of time, length, mass, electric current, thermodynamic temperature, amount of substance and luminous intensity will remain unchanged, but the definitions of their associated base units will be rewritten. By rewriting the definitions of the units, the accepted methods by which scientists and engineers arrive at their measurements will change.,On 16 November, an agreement will be made to define the seven units according to fundamental physical constants in nature. As far as the kilogram is concerned, this will be according to the Planck constant.,The new definitions agreed in November will go live in May 2019 and from then, scientists around the world will compare the gravitational force on an object with a magnetic force using a Kibble balance. The Kibble Balance, formerly known as a Watt Balance, was developed by Dr Bryan Kibble at NPL in 1975. It uses the force produced by a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field to balance the weight of a mass. By taking measurements of other experimentally-derived quantities, the Kibble balance can be used to accurately measure the Planck constant.,Instead of having to regularly compare versions of the kilogram with a national (and ultimately the international) standard, laboratories will be able to realise an internationally-accepted unit of mass on their own.,While the redefinition may not appear to affect the daily lives of people beyond the science lab, it will ultimately influence the manufacture of the products we buy, the trains and planes by which we travel and even our healthcare, through the calculation of pharmaceutical doses.,See the UK kilogram and a Kibble Balance on display in

was acquired by the museum in 2006 thanks to a National Lottery grant, via the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF), and Sharman wore this rescue suit during her flight on board SOYUZ-TM-12 to and from the MIR space station in 1991.,The world’s first spacesuits were developed by the NPP (Research & Development Production Enterprise) Zvezda (‘Star’), which was built in 1952 in the Moscow province of Tomilino and was led for many decades by academician Guy Severin, an expert in developing and creating life-support systems for pilots and cosmonauts.,The very first, SK-1 – orange, with a white helmet inscribed in red ‘CCCP’ – was worn in the first flight by Gagarin to the sixth by
Valentina Tereshkova
. Development of the SK-1 by Zvezda began in 1959 but Helen Sharman would wear a later design, the Sokol, which was developed more than a decade later in response to a tragedy.,The 22 lb suit consists of an inner layer of rubberised material and outer layer of white nylon. The suit includes the cosmonaut’s feet and its gloves attach by means of blue anodised aluminium wrist couplings. There is a pressure gauge on the left wrist and a mirror on the right to help the cosmonaut see things that would otherwise be outside his or her field of view.,When it came to getting dressed for space Sharman admitted: ‘Perhaps the greatest discomfort I suffered was doing tests in an off the shelf spacesuit, which was suited to fit a man.’,For the Juno mission, Helen was measured in 54 different places to ensure her Sokol (‘Falcon’) suit was a snug fit and could protect her at the riskiest stages of her mission, where there is a likelihood of cabin depressurization, during take-off, docking, undocking and landing.,The famous suit has now returned to our Exploring Space gallery as the museum begins a Lottery ticket trial to celebrate the direct link between playing the National Lottery and the good causes that benefit. Since 1995, the Science Museum Group of which the Science Museum is part, has received more than £65m in funding from HLF.,Science Museum Group Deputy Director, Jonathan Newby, said: ‘This trial is a positive way of celebrating the link between playing the National Lottery and inspiring cultural experiences such as seeing Helen Sharman’s spacesuit, which was acquired through a Heritage Lottery Fund grant.’,,The Science Museum has become the first national museum to trial selling National Lottery tickets and National Lottery operator Camelot hopes to roll it out at other institutions in due course.,Ros Kerslake, HLF’s CEO, said: ‘By buying a National Lottery ticket, players make an enormous contribution to supporting our national heritage, ensuring our museums are out of this world’ – much like Helen Sharman’s spacesuit…"

Academy
, a major initiative to tackle the skills shortage in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) – which costs UK businesses around £1.5 billion a year – igniting the curiosity of the next generation and providing them with valuable life skills.,The Science Museum Group Academy will be the UK’s first dedicated centre of excellence for practitioners in the informal STEM sector. Based on 25 years of experience in delivering professional training and with dedicated classrooms in the
Science Museum, London
and the
Science and Industry Museum
, Manchester (from spring 2019), Academy courses will be available across the UK and internationally.,To support the announcement, Sam Gyimah MP, Minister of State for Universities, Science, Research and Innovation,
recently talked
of the importance of creating ‘the Rosalind Franklins, Alan Turings and Stephen Hawkings of the future’ and said the Academy ‘will equip teachers, museum staff and STEM professionals with further expertise to continue to inspire the next generation.’,Andria Zafirakou, 2018 Global Teacher Prize winner, shared her experience as a teacher at the launch event and said she was ‘really impressed’ with the quality of the resources from the Academy and added she’s already using one of them. ‘It is called
Wreck your Tech
,’ she says, relishing using it with her daughters. ‘Obviously, they won’t be using my phone,’ she joked, congratulating the museum group on the initiative.,An art and design teacher, Zafirakou sees the distinction to science as ‘irrelevant’. ‘Teaching is teaching’, she says, ‘and as teachers we all strive to answer the same questions. How do I get my students to love my subject? To want to learn beyond the classroom…and to take up my subject in their future studies and careers?’,The Academy is supported by Founding Partner BP, represented at the launch by Peter Mather, Group Regional President, Europe and Head of Country, UK, who said the museum is one of his favourite places on the planet, one that is thriving and internationally relevant: ‘We are delighted to be working with the Science Museum Group. As we make the transition to a lower carbon future, the STEM skills essential for our future sustainability are in scarce supply.’,He then added, ‘This matters to society because STEM skills are so important for helping young people to access rewarding careers, and it matters to BP because our operations in the UK support around 1 in every 226 jobs in the UK economy.’,He highlighted the role of STEM ‘in the future of this planet’ and said BP was concerned about meeting the ‘dual challenge’ of providing secure and affordable energy to bring people out of poverty and preserving ‘our wonderful planet’.,If we can enthuse young people about getting involved in the challenge, and to understand it too, ‘we will have done an awful lot.’,At the core of the Academy’s work is the concept of
science capital
– a measure of how people’s relationship with science can be deepened through formal and informal experiences, and builds on Enterprising Science – a five-year partnership between the Group, King’s College London, University College London and BP. Mr Mather said BP was ‘incredibly excited’ to be extending its work with the Science Museum Group.,Launching during the
Year of Engineering
, the Academy will help address an urgent need across the UK. The Gatsby Charitable Foundation estimates 700,000 additional STEM technicians will be needed to meet demand within a decade.,Susan Raikes, Director of Learning for the Group, said: ‘Helping more people find meaning and relevance in science is at the heart of the Science Museum Group’s mission to inspire futures. The Academy’s vital work – which is only possible thanks to BP’s support – is a critical part of this mission. Each STEM practitioner supported by the Academy will gain the tools to create incredible science engagement opportunities for a much wider audience.’,At the launch of the Academy were many leading figures: Gail Cardew, Royal Institution Professor of Science, Culture and Society, and Director of Science and Education; Dr Julie Maxton CBE is the Executive Director of the Royal Society; Katherine Mathieson, Chief Executive of the British Science Association; Dame Mary Archer, Chair, Science Museum Group; Group Trustees Sharon Flood, Lopa Patel, David Jacob, Iain McIntosh; and Donald Brydon, Chairman of the Science Museum Group Foundation."

","At the Museum,Collections and Objects","conservation,engineering,time","David Rooney was the Science Museum’s Keeper of Technologies and Engineering. Below he explores the history behind the
Wells Cathedral clock mechanism
and an important
barograph clock
, as they are unveiled in prime new display positions at the museum. You can view both clocks in the
Making the Modern World
gallery.,The re-display of the Wells Cathedral clock mechanism and the barograph clock by Alexander Cumming will enable visitors to get up close with these amazing clocks while understanding their place in the wider history of British industrialisation.,The Wells Cathedral clock is one of the world’s oldest clock mechanisms, while the barograph clock was used in some of the world’s first urban climate studies. It includes two tubes of mercury on which a float rises and falls as atmospheric pressure changes. These measurements are recorded on a paper chart around the clock dial which rotates once a year.,Mechanical clocks were first invented in the late 13th century and the survival of the original mechanism from Wells Cathedral, believed to have been made in about 1390 when such machines were still new technology, is remarkable.,The Wells mechanism is now one of the oldest clocks in the world and a profoundly significant medieval British artefact. It is thought to have been constructed by the same makers as the clock at Salisbury Cathedral which, dating from 1386, is the oldest known surviving clock.,The Wells device has been displayed in South Kensington since the late 19th century, when it was replaced at the Cathedral by a newer clock. Visitors will now be able to observe more clearly than before, the medieval machine chiming the quarter hours and striking each hour as it has done over the last 600 years.,The barograph clock dates from 1766 and was made by Alexander Cumming, clockmaker to King George III. It is one of only four of its type known to have been constructed by the London maker.,After Cumming’s death the clock was bought by the famed meteorologist Luke Howard and used to make systematic observations that are among the world’s first urban climate studies. The clock’s exuberant carved mahogany case has been attributed to the esteemed cabinet-maker Thomas Chippendale and displays the detailed craft skill that expressed the importance of science in the 18th century.,The Wells Cathedral clock is one of our oldest and most cherished exhibits, while the barograph clock is an astonishing technical and aesthetic tour-de force and an icon of climate science. Both clocks demonstrate how the ingenuity of clockmakers through history has helped shape all our lives. Clocks today are still at the heart of modern science, technology and engineering.,The Wells Cathedral clock mechanism has been kindly lent to the Science Museum by the Chapter of Wells Cathedral where the original clock dial resides. The barograph clock was acquired with Art Fund support (with a contribution from The Wolfson Foundation)."

February 14, 2018,,The set contained safety googles, plastic beakers and a mat, but the idea was that the chemicals would be sorted from everyday products you might have in the kitchen.,This is a far cry, as many have bemoaned, from its chemistry set ancestors, where hazardous chemicals and potential explosions were all part of the joy of owning a home chemistry set. The Age of Health and Safety and Litigation is usually blamed for its demise.,How did the chemistry set enter the home as a recreational pastime?,The chemistry set partly originates from the portable laboratories owned by
natural philosophers
and physicians in the late 18
th
century. The Science Museum has a
fine example
of one of these from the early 20
th
-century, owned by the Scottish doctor and neurologist,
Alexander Bruce
.,Another root was the
Enlightenment
tradition of ‘rational amusements’ and ‘natural magic’. In the Victorian period, chemical ‘tricks’ and ‘magic’ became a sub-genre of conjuring, where handbooks aimed at children would contain experiments calling for sourcing chemicals from local suppliers.,In the early 20
th
century, Victorian cabinets of chemical amusements were recast as toys, but the tradition of ‘magic’ remained.,This set, ‘
Stathams Chemical Magic
’, contains a notice on the box lid informing its user that some chemicals have been excluded according to the Sale of Poisons Act (1933). But not all was lost for the young risk-seeking chemist, as these ‘chemicals could be purchased from any chemists upon signing the Poisons Book’.,Statham Laboratories was a long-running manufacturer of chemistry sets. The firm was founded in 1835 as ‘William Edward Statham and Son’, druggist to the Royal Household. They introduced their first set in 1839 called ‘Statham’s Students’ Chemical Laboratory’, which remained on sale until 1900.,The Science Museum has one dating from around the 1870s, complete with (now carefully managed) hazardous substances.,Chemistry sets boomed in the middle decades of the twentieth century. They were almost invariably marketed at boys, reflecting the gender politics of science at the time.,But that’s not to say girls didn’t encounter them at all.
Dorothy Hodgkin
was given one by a family friend, Sudan’s government chemist A. F. Joseph, at the age of 10, which would form the basis of her childhood laboratory in her home’s attic.,Rosalind Henley, a lesser known chemist, set-up her childhood set in the stables of her home: ‘The inhabitants [horses?] … were not only alarmed by the smells … I remember at least one explosion that came quite close to a disaster’.,Basements, attics, garages and sheds were the spaces where home chemistry took place.,Many Nobel laureates
cite chemistry sets as the catalyst for their careers. It has become such a trope of scientific biography that chemists feel the need to admit if they haven’t had such an experience, as Sally Horrocks has found working on the British Library’s
voices of science project
.,The 1970s witnessed a decline in the chemistry set, in the wake of increasing environmental concerns around the chemical industry and new legislation in health and safety.,New Scientist
published a damning review of two sets in 1976, which included one we have in the collection: Merit’s Chemistry’s Set 2.,It is ‘almost unbelievably old fashioned’, they wrote. ‘The cover picture shows a schoolboy with clothes and hair style of 1935, and without safety spectacles, laboratory coat or even apron’.,As well as lacking in safety instructions, the set’s handbook was judged to be inadequate in terms of education and also ‘a bore’.,In recent years there has been somewhat of a re-emergence of chemistry sets, with some of the more
high-end examples
including glassware and actual chemicals. For those budding Heston Blumenthal children who want to go down a molecular gastronomy route, there are even
sets
for them too, bringing a whole new meaning to ‘kitchen chemistry’."

Lates
. The theme had a Japanese twist inspired by an exhibition at the museum on Japanese cars. For the museum running a series of evening events aimed at adults was a new concept, and we had a conservative goal of just 500 visitors. But, as the Japanese drummers took their place and started to play the doors opened to a sea of visitors. That evening we welcomed almost 2,000 Lates-goers and there was no looking back.,September 2008 marked our first ever Lates with dedicated events for a young, cool and fun adult audience, and now we’ve had over 100 Lates on a wide range of themes. Here are my top five from over the years:,Zombies took over the museum at this Lates as we explored the science of consciousness. We encouraged visitors to come dressed as a member of the un-dead as well as recruiting some keen  drama students to roam around as zombies. We had events looking at hoard mentality, how to diagnose a zombie and a mock trial looking at zombie ethics. We also taught visitors to perform the iconic dance from Michael Jackson’s
Thriller
and had a competition for the best costume.,We hosted our very first space-inspired fashion show, ‘Couture in Orbit’, with the European Space Agency and five fashion schools from across Europe. The show displayed works from the brightest young fashion minds, inspired by technology and fabrics relating to space travel. Visitors also met researchers who work in the Antarctic testing suits that will be worn in outer space and discovered the different types of food astronauts eat during their missions.,This was a collaboration with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation as we investigated the deadliest diseases facing the world today. We created zones where we explored malaria, ebola, polio, zika and HIV. We were also joined by Bill Gates himself as well as will.i.am to discuss some of the biggest challenges facing the world today. A highlight was  the pop-up Ebola Treatment Centre where visitors could practice the life saving techniques used by experts.,As part of our
Illuminating India
season, we filled the museum with music and dance. There was Bhangra in Energy Hall, Bharatanatyam dancers in Making the Modern World, Rajasthani folk dancing in Information Age and Garba outside Wonderlab: The Equinor Gallery. Our Silent Disco was taken over by DJ and musician Wondergupta, there were
talks from eminent Indian Scientists and even a Bollywood Motown fusion band.,This June we teamed up with
Pride in London
for the second year in a row to curate an LGBTQ+ inspired extravaganza. We were joined by drag kings and queens and a host of performers including the Pink Singers, as well as drag make-up masterclasses and a drag contest.

’s joyfully celebrated birth in July 1978 represented the culmination of a difficult decade of overwhelming adversity, beset by numerous trials and tribulations. The triumph received worldwide acclaim, and a second baby was on the way (Alastair MacDonald, born 14 January 1979).,Dr Patrick Steptoe, aged 65, retired from the
NHS
, leaving the Oldham hospital that had generously supported their work. The team confidently looked forward to continuing their work in Cambridge, with dedicated premises, staff and equipment. However, the Cambridge authorities offered hopelessly inadequate facilities, inferior to those in Oldham: an ancient operating theatre on the third floor of Old Addenbrookes Hospital, and a shed on the ground floor for the IVF laboratory – impossible for achieving their goal of offering successful IVF treatment to patients.,Applications to other sources for funding were rejected – the only option left was to consider the possibility of establishing a private clinic: ‘…a further blow to my Socialist conscience…but even the impossible became acceptable as time passed, and nothing else was offered as our need became even more acute.’
1,The Editor of the Daily Mail had promised help and encouraged them to look for suitable premises.
Jean Purdy
trawled through Estate Agent lists, viewing properties, and returned with exciting news of a wonderful Hall 8 miles from Cambridge:,‘…a small, beautifully proportioned Jacobean manor house… exquisite period windows and detailing… its own chapel, stables and outbuildings…set in 20 acres of lovely parkland surrounded by an ancient moat. The family motto was carved in stone above the door: ‘Jour de ma Vie: My every day is a whole life.’
1,The Daily Mail purchased Bourn Hall, and appointed architects, surveyors and engineers. Temporary portacabins were built whilst the main building was being converted. But April 1979 brought a severe blow – the Daily Mail pulled out, on the grounds that the venture was ‘too risky’.,Work on the manor house was abandoned: ‘Bourn Hall returned to peaceful silence and decay’
1
. However, the investors agreed to hold the Hall whilst a financial company helped Steptoe and
Robert Edwards
to raise capital that would allow them to buy the premises.,Bourn Hall Clinic opened on 28 September 1980 ‘on a shoestring…the clinic is no spectacle of medical luxury…but our main concern is to keep standards consistent and high over the years to come…’.
1,Muriel Harris, leader of Steptoe’s nursing team in Oldham, set up operating theatres and wards in the portacabins; Jean Purdy was instrumental in creating laboratory facilities. The first group of 23 patients was admitted for IVF: two single embryo transfers were carried out on 27 October – and one of them had a successful pregnancy, delivering the first Bourn Hall Baby in July 1981. The second baby soon followed, after embryo transfer on 10 November: a spectacular success!,Having left IVF completely since July 1978, and at a time when no other IVF baby had yet been acknowledged elsewhere in the world, their immediate success under such difficult circumstances confirmed the team’s exceptionally high standards. With dedicated commitment, they immediately started to refine and improve protocols and methods: 1985 saw the birth of 500 babies

He then put it together with the help of a gun maker and fired it. The gun broke into several pieces, shattering the gun barrel.,It is illegal to own even a single component of a hand gun in the UK, including a 3D printed gun unless, like the Science Museum, you have a special licence.,Manufacturing our own wasn’t an option as we only have a licence to display hand guns. Having seen a video of the gun being fired, we decided this was the only feasible opportunity we would have of acquiring a 3D printed gun.,From an engineering point of view, the gun isn’t particularly special, but displaying it allows us to start a conversation around how the limitless possibilities free access to information, combined with new manufacturing techniques, like 3D printing, will impact on our lives.,On the face it having a printer that could sit on your desk and print any object you have the design for seems like a wonderful prospect. The gun represents the limitless, freely available objects you could print, but also the possible desire or need for regulations to limit our access to this information or the tools to produce them.,Creating physically dangerous items like the gun isn’t the only potential threat from 3D printing in the future. You could produce counterfeit designs of a copyrighted item, damaging the business that spent time and money producing the original. What incentive does a business have to produce innovative, exciting products if their designs can be so easily pirated? The music and film industries have struggled with these problems for years. How will other industries cope?,On the other hand what about our freedom to design and print whatever we want? The internet is not restricted by borders. You can download files from all over the world. If the information can’t be controlled can the means of manufacture? Should 3D printers require a licence to own?,When the initial story broke we wrote
a news story
, including a poll question ‘Should we have access to 3D-print plans for guns?’ 780 people voted, 42% said ‘no’ way 43% voted ‘yes’. The rest voted maybe or I’m not sure. Our visitors are clearly split on the issue; law makers have quite a challenge on their hands trying to maintain the maximum freedom while ensuring public safety.,The 3D printed gun was on display in 2013 as part of the 3D: Printing the Future exhibition.

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/plastic-parties/,Rupert Cole,Plastic Parties,On 28 July 1907 an American chemist and inventor whose name would become synonymous with plastic food containers was born.,Collections and Objects,"chemistry,materials,plastics","Earl Tupper grew up in a farm in New Hampshire. His father encouraged the inventive spirit, making devices to aid their farming, including a chicken-cleaning frame that he patented. He showed early entrepreneurial promise. At the age of 10, he initiated door-to-door selling for the farm’s poultry.,Tupper’s first company was in tree surgery and landscaping, though it went bankrupt in 1936 following the Great Depression.,That year would be a turning point. Tupper met Bernard Doyle, who led the plastics manufacturing division of DuPont, the chemical giants. He joined the firm for a year before setting up his own plastics firm, The Earl S. Tupper Company.,Across the pond, a new plastic, polyethylene, had been accidentally discovered by two scientists working at
ICI’s
research laboratory at Winnington, Cheshire. The plastic, known today under the trade name polythene, was secretly used to insulate radar cables in the Second World War.,Tupper sourced waste polythene from his former employer, DuPont. He purified and moulded the black and hard plastic into a flexible and durable material. In 1946, inspired by the humble can of paint, Tupper invented a polyethylene container with an airtight lid for food storage.,Two years later, Tupperware was born. But it was not an immediate commercial success. Tupper realised one of his best distributers,
Brownie Wise
, was selling Tupperware through home demonstration. Tupper and Wise joined forces and launched a new sales strategy.,No longer available in shops, Tupperware was sold through Tupperware Parties and it was a big success. Wise became Vice President of Marketing in Tupper’s business. The Party Plan model was copied around the world.,Wise became somewhat of a celebrity in 1950s America, but things turned sour when Tupper fired her (some cite jealousy, others sexism) just before selling the company to the pharma company Rexel in 1958 for 16 million dollars. Wise received a 30,000 dollars years’ salary.,The story of Brownie Wise is currently being made into a
blockbuster film
starring Sandra Bullock.,Tupperware, under new management, continued to thrive into the 1960s and 1970s. The Science Museum has in its collection an example of the machine mould that mass produced individual items of Tupperware.

Before the space age and communications satellites there was no live TV coverage of the World Cup and we could all get on with our work and jobs around the house and garden.,It was just another international sporting event covered by radio, recorded television reports and on the back pages of the newspapers. There was less tension, less hype and, to put it bluntly, less interest. Oh, how times have changed.,Telstar relayed the very
first TV pictures by satellite
in 1962. The event was a technological triumph, a harbinger of near-real time global culture and, not least, the inspiration for one of the most
distinctive pop
records ever made.,Telstar, though, occupied an orbit that made continuous broadcast impossible. After a while the satellite would dip below the horizon and the signal it was relaying would be lost.,The development of more powerful space rockets allowed satellites to be launched to the far higher
geostationary
belt around the Earth’s equator.

IVF: 6 Million Babies Later
which celebrates the ‘miraculous’ birth of the very first, Louise Brown, on 25 July 1978 –
a landmark in reproductive technology pioneered by British researchers
.,This exhibition, curated by Connie Orbach and Ling Lee of the Science Museum, explores the decade of experimentation, hundreds of failed attempts and many setbacks in the quest to treat infertility faced by Robert Edwards, Patrick Steptoe and Jean Purdy, sometimes called the
‘forgotten IVF pioneer’
.,‘IVF is just one example of the huge potential the UK has for scientific and clinical innovation, respected the world over and celebrated in the Science Museum’s wonderful exhibitions – today, of course, focused on IVF,’ said Cheshire, Chair of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), who has personal experience of IVF.,‘But it is to Professor Sir Robert Edwards, Dr Patrick Steptoe and Jean Purdy that we owe the most, for developing IVF, persisting until it succeeded and allowing millions of patients after Lesley and John Brown, Louise’s parents, to create their much longed-for families,’ she told launch event attendees in the museum’s
Who am I?
gallery.,‘I would like to acknowledge Bob and Patrick’s family members here today, to say a very public thank you,’ she said, also praising the Science Museum as a ‘world leader’ in handling complex issues.,‘It is significant today that we celebrate this medical innovation that has changed so may people’s lives, on the same day as the 70th anniversary of the NHS celebrations.’,The UK has reached the milestones of 1 million IVF treatment cycles and 300,000 IVF babies born. Worldwide estimates of the number of children born this way vary from five million to as many as 10 million.,She added that a recent article in
Reproductive BioMedicine Online
estimated that by 2100, 400 million babies or 3% of the global population could exist by virtue of IVF, including the original IVF babies and their descendants.,IVF was so controversial during the 10-year period in which it was developed by Edwards, Steptoe and Purdy that the Medical Research Council refused to fund it. Much of that money came from an American millionairess,
Lillian Lincoln Howell
, who herself suffered from fertility problems and remained an anonymous benefactor until her death in 2014. ‘It was not all plain sailing – this exhibition shows that,’ said Cheshire.,Unease about the technology led the then Government to commission an inquiry, chaired by Mary Warnock, to consider the social, ethical and legal implications of IVF and what safeguards were required, said Cheshire (an interview with Baroness Warnock can be seen
here
).,The Warnock report, published in 1984, identified the need for principles and limits to govern fertility treatment and embryo research, and ultimately paved the way for the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act in 1990 and shortly after the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (or HFEA for short) in 1991.,‘The ethical lines laid down by Baroness Warnock, such as the 14-day rule for keeping embryos for research, still stand and there has been no “slippery slope”,’ said Cheshire, though scientists have recently developed the ability to
grow embryos beyond this limit
.,Since then, ‘we have seen embryo testing developed to allow people to avoid passing on serious inherited diseases to any children they might have. The UK was the first country in the world to license ground-breaking mitochondrial donation techniques (see interview
here
) which allow women who carry the risk of serious mitochondrial disease to avoid passing it onto their children (more can be found out
here
). We also continue to lead the way in gene editing research (more
here
).’,‘The 40th anniversary of IVF is a milestone but it feels like we are only in the early days of an exciting and challenging time ahead as medicine and science move on,’ said Cheshire. ‘Only this week we have seen media coverage of the possibilities of an artificial human ovary.’ Other possibilities were discussed
recently at the Manchester Science Festival
.,Roger Highfield, the Science Museum’s Director of External Affairs, said the exhibition ‘shows how the birth of Louise fuelled the rapid acceptance of a fringe technology that went on to have a huge impact on society, paving the way for embryology, stem cell science and more.’,When it came to ethics, ‘we had to find a middle path between those who felt reproduction was sacred and pragmatists who wanted to understand human reproduction to deal with problems such as infertility.,‘This is also a very human story, of the scientists working in the field and the people undergoing the treatment, and our exhibition brings those stories to the foreground.’,Highfield thanked the many individuals and organisations who helped make this exhibition possible: Katie Dow, Martin Johnson and Kay Elder; Fertility Network UK; Reproductive Sociology Research Group and Magda Zernicka-Goetz Group at The University of Cambridge; Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority; Bourn Hall Clinic; London Women’s Clinic; and ABC IVF.,Among those present at the launch were Jane Denton, President of the British Fertility Society; Margaret Gilmore, deputy chair of the HFEA who as a cub reporter 40 years ago, had the pleasure of documenting Louise’s birth; Andrew Steptoe, UCL; Robert Edwards’ daughter Jenny Joy; Martin Johnson, Emeritus Professor of Reproductive Sciences at the University of Cambridge; Mark Downs, Chief Executive at Royal Society of Biology; Yacoub Khalaf, Professor of Reproductive Medicine at Guy’s Hospital; Geeta Nargund, Medical Director of Create Fertility, and IVF exhibition participants who shared their own stories with us.,The 40th birthday of IVF and Louise Mullinder (nee Brown) will be celebrated at a special Science Museum Lates on Wednesday 25 July 2018 at 7pm, which also celebrates the
70
th
birthday of the NHS

The public’s reaction was divided. Some were proud that the UK had developed a new way of helping people have the families they longed for, but others were uneasy about the apparently uncontrolled advance of science, which brought with it new possibilities for manipulating the early stages of human development. It was that unease that led to an inquiry, chaired by Mary Warnock, that considered the social, ethical and legal implications of IVF and what safeguards should be put in place.,In 1984, the
Warnock report
identified the need for principles and limits to govern fertility treatment and human embryo research and recommended an independent body be created to make sure clinics operated within these boundaries. And after an interim period where this responsibility was delegated to the Interim (Voluntary) Licensing Authority, legislation was passed and the
Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA)
was established.,We were set up to make sure patients could access safe treatment. And that’s still the case. We license, monitor and inspect UK fertility clinics to ensure they’re providing high quality care.,IVF has become more common, but not commonplace – it’s still an overwhelming rollercoaster of a journey with so many different things to consider. That’s why we pride ourselves on being the go-to source of clear, unbiased and reliable information on fertility treatments and clinics.
Our website
is an invaluable source of information and our
Choose a Fertility Clinic
service allows patients to compare like with like; no marketing, no sales chatter.,There have been huge advancements in scientific research and medicine over the past 40 years. We’ve seen embryo testing developed to allow people to avoid passing on serious inherited diseases to any children they might have, the development of, and advancements in, egg freezing, and laws passed and updated to reflect the changing face of fertility medicine.,And the UK continues to take the lead. We were the first country in the world to license ground-breaking mitochondrial donation techniques which allow women who carry the risk of serious mitochondrial disease to avoid passing it onto their children. We also continue to lead the way in gene editing research.,IVF now happens globally; but the way it is regulated varies from country to country. It’s fair to say that the world looks to the UK model as the blueprint, with the right mix of allowing innovation but maintaining public trust.,Success rates have doubled over the last 25-30 years to around 30% but we still have a long way to go. The reality is that most people who have fertility treatment are unsuccessful, which is just one reason why emotional support before, during and after treatment is so important.,For a fortunate minority, IVF has been the ‘miracle’ science that’s brought them the baby they’ve longed for. For the majority, it’s been a road filled with anguish, frustration and heartache. We want to see that pattern changed and we will work with clinics and researchers in pursuit of that goal, ensuring patients receive the safest, highest quality care along the way.,Visit

research highlights that not everyone will access our learning opportunities equally. Visitors come to our museums with different levels of confidence, experiences, knowledge and skills to engage with the museum galleries and for many, a museum visit experience can feel overwhelming and disorienting.,Designed in response to this problem, our
Great Object Hunt
paper-based resource was developed to open up our galleries to visitors and provide a fun, engaging experience which helps them make a personal connection with our objects and with science. The resource is framed by the museum’s learning philosophy and promotes our ethos of ‘igniting curiosity’ both in our museum and beyond.,Following on from the success of the paper-based resource, our next ambition was to create a digital component which would extend this experience within the format of a mobile app. We know that smartphone ownership is very high amongst family visitors and that families enjoy photographing objects in the collection, and each other. We also know that many children and adults find game-like or competitive scenarios to be a great motivation for engagement. We brought these insights together with the ethos of the Great Object Hunt, and the concept for our new mobile app was born.,Working in partnership with
Aardman Interactive
, we developed Treasure Hunters, a game which encourages players to explore their surroundings, builds an understanding of how science impacts our everyday lives and encourages discussions within a group about the objects they find and stories they uncover. Treasure Hunters can be played solo or in teams at any of our museums or other location, including at home.,,Players compete by responding to challenges posed by the app – questions like, “Can you find something made of wood?”; “Can you find something older than you?”, “Can you find something you might take to a party?” Players take photographs of their chosen objects and can go head to head with other family members – who will find the best, most interesting object?,The challenges are open across the museums and not fixed to one gallery or series of objects. We hope this will encourage players to look beyond the more famous objects, find new things they may not have noticed before and follow their own interests as they seek out what they think is the best answer to challenges.,﻿,The app is free to download for both
iOS
and
Android
devices. We’re excited about this launch as the game gives people a unique new way to explore their surroundings, whether they are in any of the Science Museum Group museums at home, or beyond."

blowing up national monuments
, demonstrating
unimaginable power over us
, or
eradicating us like pests
, the world of cinema makes it very clear that aliens are things to be feared.  Stephen Hawking had
famously warned us
against contact with alien life, fearful of our colonial history repeating itself on a planetary scale.  But what kinds of aliens are we most likely to find?  And what implications would those life forms have for the scientific community?,Life has been around on Earth for about 3.5 billion years – an incredible amount of time on the human scale.  For the first 2.9 billion years of that time, all life was confined to single celled organisms, the bacteria and amoebas that still cover the planet.,Imagine that for a moment: from the first cell taking shape in Earth’s oceans to you reading this sentence – for more than 80% of that time life had not become complex enough to become multicellular. That leap from being one cell to two is quite a large one, and it’s possible that there are countless planets out there with life that never made that leap.  From looking only the example of our own world, we could suppose that if we do encounter life at all in the cosmos, there is a very good chance that these life forms will be tiny.,Taking this in to account, should we still fear these alien bacteria?  We may not be facing the enemies suggested by Hollywood’s
Mars Attacks
or
Men in Black
– little men armed and ready to destroy – but with the discovery of an alien microbe, should we be fearful?,We like to think of us humans as being the dominant species on Earth, but truly, it is bacteria that are able to adapt and thrive to any environment, whether they are bombarded with radiation, faced with extreme heat, or put under
great amounts of pressure
.  If we ignore viruses – which may or may not be considered alive – bacteria are the most prolific living thing on Earth. By all accounts, we are living on their planet.,Our bodies, too, are an ecosystem dominated by bacteria. Recent studies have shown that about 43% of cells in our bodies are human, with
just over half of our cells being bacterial
. Because we have evolved alongside these creatures, our bodies are already equipped to deal with harmful infections and the presence of bacteria is thought to
support the different systems within us
.,These bacteria are incredible creatures, capable of swapping their DNA with one another, multiplying quickly to mutate and develop, and living lives in our gut that we would otherwise associate with something like a lion on the savannah: hunting, eating, forming communities, producing offspring, working as a team with others to gain access to resources.  Their ability to share genetic code and reproduce is what is driving our problem of antibiotic resistance today – bacteria can evolve much faster than we can invent new medications to get rid of the bugs that are causing us harm.,Now let’s suppose a new microbe enters the mix. Let’s say, something brought back on a mission from
Europa
– something that our bodies have never seen before.  Chances are, like with most bacteria, it would sit harmlessly in our system until it died, was attacked by our other bacteria, or noticed by our immune system and wiped out. But there is also a possibility that this new life form could interact with our bodies and with other bacteria in completely unexpected ways.,For example, if these aliens were to have extra thick cellular walls, they would be much more difficult to kill by either our immune systems or antibiotics. While these bacteria may be completely harmless to us, other bacteria can still exchange DNA with it, empowering other organisms within our bodies to also grow this thick shell.,Bacteria love to share, and the more they share their defences, the harder they are to kill. Given time, you would be full of microbes with this alien DNA that made any infection you would pick up resistant to medicines and to our natural defences. This is, of course, assuming alien bacteria would have similar biology to what we have here on Earth, being carbon based and complete with DNA.  Finding something completely foreign could be potentially disastrous, creating disease or systemic infection to which there would be no known defence.,At the same time, finding a new alien microbe could open new doors in the medical world. Many of our antibiotics are derived from nature – moulds and bacteria fighting one another – that we have in turn manipulated to fight infection on our behalf.
Streptomyces
, an example of a bacterium that lives in soil, has given us many antibiotics.  But with the rise of antibiotic resistance and the emergence of superbugs here on Earth, we need new microscopic weapons to use against diseases that are becoming increasingly difficult to treat, like gonorrhoea or tuberculosis.,A new species of bacteria – something we’ve never seen before – could give us that weapon that we wouldn’t find anywhere on Earth. A new species could mean new medicines to protect us and future generations from infections.,Despite
some false alarms
, we’ve never found evidence of alien microbes and such a discovery would change our place in the universe forever. While we’re most likely to find microscopic life on our interplanetary adventures, we could either be facing a great danger or potentially the key to incredible progress.,Much like the stories we see in the movies, we won’t know what this kind of contact will really mean until it’s here.,Visit our free exhibition

You vote to choose what Dr. Moritz will do at every twist and turn of the story, but where do you draw the line? Creator of the film, John Bradburn, tells us more.",At the Museum,frankenstein,"Pandemic
follows the story of Dr. Moritz as she negotiates the spread of a pandemic resulting in mass heart failure. Along the way she has to make some difficult moral decisions in creating a hybrid creature to provide donor organs.,Or, to be more precise,
you
will have to make some difficult decisions.,,The film is my reaction to
Frankenstein
. I have always been interested in the relationship between the audience and the creature; specifically how it changes over time. As a teenager I think most people identify with the creature – feeling uncomfortable in your body and alienated from everyone else. As you get older (and become a parent) I think you identify a lot more with the relationship Victor has with the creature. This relationship of parent and child and how it is mirrored in human/animal relationships is at the core of what I wanted to explore.
In my research for the film I came up against some very interesting and difficult ideas. For example, certain organs are sold on the black market (the average price of a kidney is $5000) and this in effect stops the need for research into creating them in a lab – this is why, in
Pandemic
, hearts are affected. Similarly, I was surprised by how much ego and interpersonal relationships can affect decision making. This was really born out in the screenings – most audience members made decisions based on how they related to other characters rather than making the more logical choice.,With
Pandemic
, I wanted to make the audience spend time with the creatures that they create. The idea that even though they will ultimately be sacrificed, you will need to care for them for a certain period of time; you will have to be physically near them to observe their lives while saving more distant and abstract lives. It is this living with your decisions that interested me in an interactive format – once you have made a decision, you will have to watch it play out. And it might not play out how you want it to. This is why I think
Pandemic
worked so well in an auditorium. While playing
Pandemic
at home, you may go backwards or take a glimpse at other possibilities, but in the auditorium the audience were locked in their decisions.
We used a simple system of red and white cards to define the yes/no answers. What originally felt like quite a lo-fi piece of technology actually proved to be one of the most interesting facets of the film. I would say 90% of audience members looked to see how others were voting and 20% or so would change their decision based on this. In the film there is an early scene (no spoilers) where the Department of Health talks about the need for public consultation. A few audience members reflected on how they were swayed by what others thought rather than what they knew was ‘right’. This raises some interesting questions about how public engagement works – is it what people really believe or what they think they should believe?,Pandemic
has been an amazing project, from being able to talk to scientists at the cutting edge of their field to directing Jenny Agutter over Skype. The whole thing has been wonderful, weird and brilliant. To be able to make something that touches an audience and makes them think is a rare privilege indeed.,For anyone interested in the workings behind the film – there are over 70 different videos in
Pandemic
, making up over an hour of distinct and different content. We shot for 7 days in Worcester and Kidderminster. At times putting this film together has felt like four-dimensional chess. I hope you enjoy it!,,Pandemic
was created by John Bradburn in collaboration with the Science Museum.,Warning: this film contains themes related to creating artificial life, moderate psychological threat and horror sequences that some people may find disturbing. It may not be suitable for children aged under 14."

National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research (NC3Rs),
and sponsored by GSK, the prizewinning research was conducted by
Dr Elisa Passini
at the University of Oxford’s Department of Computer Science, with Janssen Pharmaceutica.,The winning paper describes a ‘drug trial’, where 62 drugs and reference compounds were tested at various concentrations in more than a thousand simulations of human heart cells.,Early prediction of possible heart problems is critical for drug development: around 40% of drugs that were withdrawn from the market between 2001 and 2010 had cardiovascular safety issues.,Their computer model predicted the risk that drugs would cause abnormal heart rhythms in patients with 89% accuracy. They compared these computer predictions with data obtained from previously-conducted comparable animal studies and found the animal research was less accurate (75%) than the computer predictions of how the drugs would behave in the body.,This ‘Virtual Assay’ software developed by the Oxford team opens the way for the estimated 60,000 animals used globally each year for this purpose can be reduced. A number of companies have already adopted the technology, and this is expected to grow.,Dr Passini works in the group of Dr Alfonso Bueno-Orovio and Professor Blanca Rodriguez, who said there was a longer-term ambition to develop the virtual assay based on heart cells into virtual organs. ‘We are already conducting in silico drug trials with whole ventricles (heart chambers) during heart attacks.”,Prof Rodriguez was one of the speakers at a recent event about ‘virtual humans’ at the Science Museum, where there was a premiere in the IMAX of a film about the potential of the virtual human project by Fernando Cucchietti and Guillermo Marin of the

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/50-shades-of-beige/,Shaz Hussain,50 Shades of Beige,Assistant Curator Shaz Hussain explores the history of the personal computer to answer the ever important question: why beige?,Collections and Objects,,"They say black is the chicest colour, it goes with everything. Which is why the sleek, minimalist design of your phone, laptop or tablet fits neatly into your lifestyle. But your stylish device hasn’t always been so slick. In fact, it probably used to be somewhat of an ugly duckling.,Cast your mind back to a time when big hair was all the rage, Madonna’s ‘Like a Prayer’ was on the radio, and there was this crazy new thing called the World Wide Web. If you were working in an office in the late 80s you’ll probably also remember the beige boxes. That’s right, your humble desktop computer came in an array of alluring shades of beige, ecru, putty or even café au lait.,Why beige? It’s not considered the most fetching colour yet nearly every computer manufacturer was making beige computers in the late 70s right through to the early 90s. Even brands like Apple, who are now known for their sleek aesthetic, once fell victim to the trend for beige as shown in this
1993 Apple Mac
from our collection.,There are lots of possible reasons as to why personal computers were once beige. When these machines were still a relatively new feature in offices it was thought that an inoffensive, neutral coloured computer would appear less intimidating to the not so technologically savvy – the idea being that beige computers would blend in seamlessly with the office décor.,It has also been suggested that the putty coloured computers wouldn’t show their age as much because, charmingly, they already looked a bit dirty. Before the smoking ban came into place in 2007 perhaps an old nicotine-stained computer wouldn’t have looked so different to a new one.,So, when did beige go out of fashion? Arguably the colour was never in vogue and computer manufacturers just began hiring designers with better taste. The real answer perhaps lies with the iconic black
IBM ThinkPad
.,The ThinkPad was a revolution in personal computers, not only for its radical black colour, but also for its innovative design. Based on the aesthetic of a Japanese bento box, the minimalist design was so popular it has become standard computer design across many different brands today.,Strangely enough, although personal computers were almost always beige, many earlier models originally came in black. So why did IBM switch back from beige to black? According to the ThinkPad book published by IBM in 2000, a German workplace standard came into effect in the late 70s that required light colours for all office equipment.,This standard became adopted by other European countries and before long all office equipment that wasn’t beige or grey had been eradicated. Of course, computer manufacturers would then only make their products in light colours so they could sell the same products in Europe and in other countries. Inevitably, that meant offices around the world ended up with beige computers.,However, with the ThinkPad, IBM wanted to make a statement. Instead of blending into office backgrounds, they wanted people to actually notice their computers. IBM was still under pressure to create a line of pebble grey ThinkPads for the German market in compliance with their workplace standards, but they were adamant that the ThinkPad should be black. Eventually Germany approved the black ThinkPads but only if they came with a warning that they were not for office use.,Clearly IBM’s radical new approach to personal computer design was a risk that paid off. ThinkPad became a huge success from its first release in October 1992. The simple change in design had created a covetable product and a sense of status for the user.,ThinkPads were the only laptops certified for use on the International Space Station, they have won numerous awards and have gained cult status amongst computer enthusiasts. Fashion trends may be cyclical but thankfully when it comes to computers it doesn’t look like beige will be making a comeback anytime soon.,"

James Lovelock
, our most famous independent scientist, cradling a baby in his arms who would grow to become the world’s best known scientist,
Stephen Hawking
.,Lovelock told me about this touching encounter during one of his recent visits to the
Science Museum
, a vivid reminder of why the museum has spent £300,000 on his archive, an extraordinary collection of notebooks, manuscripts photographs and correspondence that reveals the remarkable extent of his research over a lifetime, from cryobiology and colds to Gaia and geoengineering.,Lovelock, who was born on 26 July 1919, must have encountered the great cosmologist in the year of Hawking’s birth, 1942, when he was working at the Medical Research Council’s National Institute for Medical Research, after graduating in chemistry from Manchester University the year before.,Hawking’s father was Frank Hawking (1905-1986) who spent much of his working life at the NIMR studying parasitology. Lovelock was doing research at the time of the encounter on sneezing and disinfection, publishing his first
scientific paper
, in the British Medical Journal, that same year.,As for his impact, there’s no better way to emphasise Lovelock’s stature than to read the foreword of one of his recent books,
The Vanishing Face of Gaia
, by Lord Rees, Astronomer Royal, and the Master of Trinity College, Cambridge, who describes him as among the most important independent scientists of the last century: “He is a hero to many scientists – certainly to me.”,Lovelock has made headlines for his views on the environment, and his support for nuclear power (he once
told me
he would happily store nuclear waste in his garden), but he is best known for introducing the world to the seductive idea of
Gaia
, which says the Earth behaves as though it were an organism. The concept first reached a wide audience in 1975 in an article published in
New Scientist
, but was ridiculed, attacked for being teleological, even mocked as an “evil religion”.,Lovelock’s computer simulation, Daisyworld, helped Gaia mature from a hypothesis into a theory by putting it on a mathematical foundation. Light, and dark, coloured daisies evolved within an idealised world, waxing and waning to balance the way they absorbed and reflected sunlight to regulate the temperature, so it was optimum for plant growth. Among the items acquired by the museum is a Hewlett Packard computer that Lovelock used for Daisyworld.,Bolstering Lovelock’s Gaian vision came experimental evidence, the discovery that sulphur from ocean algae circulated worldwide in a form that has since been linked with the formation of clouds that are able to cool the world by reflecting sunlight back into space. Today, Gaia’s influence stretches beyond Earth to music, fiction and even computer games.,The Science Museum’s collection includes Lovelock’s Electron Capture Detector which he invented in 1956 to detect a range of substances, he explained, ‘mostly nasty poisons and carcinogens, or else harmful to the atmosphere like nitrous oxide and halocarbons.’ In the summer of 1967 Lovelock used it measured the supposedly clean air blowing off the Atlantic onto Ireland’s west coast and found that it contained CFCs, now known to cause ozone depletion. ‘It’s sad that it would now be almost impossible for a lone scientist like me to make or use an ECD without breaking the health and safety laws,’ he told me.,I have met this green guru on and off since 1991 and, the last time we talked, he was as provocative as ever. The attempts to model the Earth’s climate system do not yet fully include the response of the ecosystem of the land or oceans, and Lovelock warned about feedback effects, some that can damp down climate change and others that accelerate it, and he predicts a threshold above which there could be a five degree increase in temperature.,He is withering about the attempt of the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
to forge a consensus, a word that he says has no place in science. That is no surprise. From 1964 Lovelock has worked as an independent scientist and he is writing a book about being a lone scientist in response to an article in the Wall Street Journal which argued that the scientific process can only happen through collaboration. Lovelock believes that lone scientists can work more like artists in that they can be reflective and do not necessarily need other people to collaborate with.,And when it comes to the fate of our home world, all is not lost. Lovelock, like many others, is receptive to another idea that, relatively recently, was laughed off as unrealistic, even a little mad: geoengineering, or “planetary medicine”, which could mean cooling the Earth by the use of space mirrors or clouds of particulates.,Lovelock, who has been visiting the Science Museum since the age of seven, teamed with a former Museum Director, Chris Rapley, to devise another way to cool our overheated world: pumping chilly waters from the ocean depths to fertilize the growth of carbon-hungry blooms."

Nobel Prize
.,Before we raise a toast to this years’
winners in physics
, Peter Higgs and Belgian François Englert, let’s take a look back at the man behind the Prize, and some of its winners.,Alfred Nobel,A Swedish explosives pioneer who made his millions from inventing dynamite, Alfred Nobel left in his will a
bequest to establish an annual prize
for those who have “conferred the greatest benefit to mankind”, across five domains: physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature and peace. To this end, he allocated the majority of his enormous wealth.,When Nobel’s will was read after his death in 1896, the prize caused an international controversy. Unsurprisingly, Nobel’s family were not best pleased, and vigorously opposed its establishment. It took five years before it was finally set up and the
first lot awarded
– the 1901 physics accolade going to Wilhelm Rontgen for his 1895 discovery of x-rays.,Paul Dirac’s maternal mortification,When the phone rang on 9 November 1933, the exceptionally gifted yet eccentric Paul Dirac was a little taken back to hear a voice from Stockholm tell him he had won the Nobel Prize.,The looming press attention, which had always surrounded the Nobels, made the reclusive Dirac consider rejecting the award, until Ernest Rutherford – JJ Thomson’s former student and successor as Cavendish professor – advised him that a “refusal will get you more publicity”.,Under different circumstances Rutherford had been similarly “startled” when he found out he was to be given a Nobel – a physicist through and through, he was awarded the
1908 Prize in Chemistry
, joking his sudden “metamorphosis into a chemist” was very unexpected.,Dirac shared the 1933 physics prize with Erwin Schrödinger – famed for his eponymous equation and dead-and-alive cat – for their contributions to quantum mechanics. Each was allowed one guest at the award ceremony held at the
Swedish Royal Academy of Science
. Schrödinger brought his wife, Dirac brought his mother.,Florence Dirac did what all good mothers do: embarrass her son in every way imaginable. The first incident came at a station café in Malmo, where in this unlikely setting an impromptu press conference took place.,Dirac, who had been described by the British papers as “shy as a gazelle and modest as a Victorian maid,” was asked “did the Nobel Prize come as a surprise?” Before he could answer, Dirac’s mother butted in: “Oh no, not particularly, I have been waiting for him to receive the prize as hard as he has been working.”,The next embarrassment came when Mrs Dirac failed to wake up when the train reached Stockholm. She was ejected by a guard, who had thrown her garments and belongings out of the carriage window. The Diracs arrived late, and meekly hid from the attention of the welcoming party – who had been wondering where they were.,The third and final maternal faux pas came at Stockholm’s Grand Hotel. The pair had been booked into the finest room – the bridal suite. Mrs Dirac, displeased, demanded a room of her own, which Dirac paid for out of his own pocket. It doesn’t matter if you’ve co-founded quantum mechanics, predicted antimatter and won the Nobel Prize; mothers will be mothers.,Peter’s Pride,Like other humble laureates before him, Peter Higgs wished to duck out of the press furore surrounding the Nobel. At the time of
the announcement
on the 8
th
October there was a nail-biting delay. The cause? The Nobel committee could not get hold of Higgs, who had turned his phone off and planned to escape to the Scottish Highlands.,As Peter Higgs revealed to me at the opening of the
Collider
exhibition at the Science Museum, if it was not for a dodgy Volkswagen beetle or public transport, Peter would have made it to the Highlands on Nobel day. Instead, he just laid low in Edinburgh.,At the
Collider launch last month
, we celebrated with Higgs in the appropriate way: over a personalised bottle of London Pride ale – the same beverage he chose in favour of champagne on the flight home from CERN’s public announcement of the
Higgs boson discovery
. So, when Englert and Higgs receive the honour today, let’s all raise two glasses: an English Ale and a Belgian Blonde!,For more on many of the Nobel prize-winning discoveries in physics history, including those of Dirac, Englert and Higgs, visit the Collider exhibition at the Science Museum."

Collider
exhibition
about the world’s greatest experiment than with a special screening of
Particle Fever
, a documentary exploring the same extraordinary story of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN?,Critics, such as the
New York Times
, have given the film rave reviews and there was a palpable buzz when Director
Mark Levinson
, was joined in the museum’s IMAX theatre by one of the stars of the film, experimental physicist Monica Dunford, for a revealing pre-screening conversation with broadcaster
Alok Jha
.,Dunford, who was a relative newcomer to CERN in Geneva when Levinson began filming for Particle Fever in 2007, is one of six scientists and engineers Levinson chose to follow out of more than 10,000 scientists from over 100 nations at CERN. She told the audience that her motivation for getting involved in the film was partly to change attitudes about scientists. As she put it, “my goal is to tell people what I do and them say awesome and not recoil in horror.”,With a beguiling mix of wit, levity and scientific gravitas, the film follows events at CERN as the LHC began circulating proton beams in 2008, the setbacks that followed, notably a ‘quench’ and explosive release of one ton of helium, and the jubilation – along with the tears of theoretician Peter Higgs – as history is made with the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012, half a century after Higgs had glimpsed its existence with the help of mathematics.,Levinson, who worked on the movie with physicist/producer David Kaplan and editor Walter Murch (Apocalypse Now, The English Patient), was granted huge access and trust by the team at CERN, something he puts down to his own past as a particle physicist before he moved into film making.,He and Monica took the time to see our
Collider
exhibition
to compare how our own
creative team
responded to the world’s greatest experiment: “It was fascinating and impressive to see the authenticity achieved in the Collider exhibition. Monica and I laughed that the detail even extended to the “telephone stations” and “
physics cartoons
” that are on bulletin boards all over CERN – and included an iconic photo from First Beam Day featuring Monica with a raised fist of celebration!”,The screening rounded off a series of events, staged in partnership with
the Guardian
, our media partner for Collider, which began with an extraordinary launch day with
Professor Peter Higgs
answering questions from a group of students from across the UK in
our IMAX theatre
. He was followed by novelist
Ian McEwan
and theoretical physicist, and Particle Fever star,
Nima Arkani-Hamed
sharing their thoughts
on similarities and differences between the cultures of science and culture. The final IMAX event was a lecture by Stephen Hawking, who
talked about the impact of the discovery of the Higgs
and his life-long love of the Science Museum.,The grand finale of that day was a party launched by the Philharmonia Orchestra and attended by the speakers, along with Chancellor, George Osborne, the Director General of CERN, Rolf-Dieter Heuer, and director of the Science Museum Group, Ian Blatchford.,"

Nobel Prize
for Physics
“for the theoretical discovery of a mechanism that contributes to our understanding of the origin of mass of subatomic particles, and which recently was confirmed through the discovery of the predicted fundamental particle, by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at CERN’s Large Hadron Collider.”,A few minutes ago, after an unusual delay, the
Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences
announced the winners of the physics prize in Stockholm, ending this chapter of the quest for new elementary particles, the greatest intellectual adventure to date.,Ian Blatchford, Director of the Science Museum, comments: “That it has taken decades to validate the existence of the Higgs Boson illustrates the remarkable vision of the theoretical work that Higgs, Francois Englert and others did with pen and paper half a century ago, one that launched an effort by  thousands of scientists and inspired a staggering feat of engineering in the guise of the Large Hadron Collider.,What is the Higgs? Here’s all you need to know, in just 90 seconds, from
Harry Cliff
, a Cambridge University physicist working on the LHCb experiment and the first Science Museum Fellow of Modern Science,Although the identity of the winners has been a closely-guarded secret, many have speculated that those who played a central role in discovery of the long-sought Higgs, notably the emeritus Edinburgh professor himself, were leading contenders for a place in history.,The
Science Museum
has been so confident that the Large Hadron Collider would change our view of nature that we have invested more than £1 million, and worked closely with the European Organization for Nuclear Research,
CERN
, to celebrate this epic undertaking with its new exhibition,
Collider
: step inside the world’s greatest experiment
, which opens to the public on 13 November.,Here Higgs explains how the Large Hadron Collider works during a visit to what is now Cotham School, Bristol, where he was once a pupil.,In July 2012, two separate research teams at CERN’s £5 billion Large Hadron Collider
reported evidence of a new particle
thought to be the Higgs boson, technically a ripple in an invisible energy field that gives most particles their mass.,This discovery represented the final piece of the
Standard Model
, a framework of theory developed in the late 20th century that describes the interactions of all known subatomic particles and forces, with the exception of gravity.,Nima Arkani-Hamed, a leading theoretical physicist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton who will attend the launch of
Collider
, bet a year’s salary the Higgs will be found at the LHC.,Another speaker at the
Collider
launch, the world’s most famous scientist, Prof Stephen Hawking, lost a $100 bet he made against the discovery (
though he is adamant that Higgs deserves the Nobel Prize
).,Higgs, who refuses to gamble, told me just before the LHC powered up that he would have been puzzled and surprised if the LHC had failed in its particle quest. “If I’m wrong, I’ll be rather sad. If it is not found, I no longer understand what I think I understand.”,When Higgs was in the CERN auditorium last year to hear scientists tell the world about the discovery, he was caught reaching for a handkerchief and dabbing his eyes.  On the flight home, he celebrated this extraordinary achievement with a can of London Pride beer.,The Science Museum hoped to have the can, now deemed a piece of history Alas,
Higgs had dumped it in the rubbish
before we could collect it. However, the museum does possess the champagne bottle that Higgs emptied with his friends the night before the big announcement.,The modest 84-year-old  is now synonymous with the quest: the proposed particle was named the Higgs boson in 1972.,But there have been demands that the
particle be renamed to acknowledge the work of others
. Deciding who should share this Nobel has been further complicated because a maximum of three people only can be honoured (prompting many to question
the criteria used by the Nobel committee
).,The LHC, the world’s most powerful particle accelerator, is the cumulative endeavour of around ten thousand men and women from across the globe. In recognition of this the Collider exhibition will tell the behind-the-scenes story of the Higgs discovery from the viewpoint of a young PhD student given the awesome task of announcing the discovery to her colleagues (though fictional, the character is based on Mingming Yang of
MIT
who is attending the launch).,However, although
one suggestion
is to allow the two research teams who discovered the Higgs boson to share the accolade, the Nobel committee traditionally awards science prizes to individuals and not organizations (unlike the Nobel Peace Prize).,Instead, the Nobel committee honoured the theoreticians who first anticipated the existence of the Higgs.,Six scientists published the relevant papers in 1964 though, as Belgium’s
Robert Brout died in 2011
, there were five contenders (
the Nobel Prize cannot be given posthumously
).,In August 1964, François Englert from the Free University of Brussels with Brout, published their theory of particle masses. A month later, while working at Edinburgh University, Higgs published a separate paper on the topic, followed by another in October that was – crucially – the first to explicitly state the Standard Model required the existence of a new particle. In November 1964, American physicists Dick Hagen and Gerry Guralnik and British physicist Tom Kibble added to the discussion by publishing their own research on the topic.,Last week, Prof Brian Cox of Manchester University, who works at CERN, said it would be ‘odd and perverse’ not to give the Nobel to Peter Higgs, and also singled out Lyn ‘the atom’ Evans, the Welshman in charge of building the collider, as a candidate.,And the two likeliest winners were named as Peter Higgs – after whom the particle was named – and François Englert,
according to a citation analysis by Thomson Reuters
.,Today’s announcement marks the formal recognition of a profound advance in human understanding, the discovery of one of the keystones of what we now understand as the fundamental building blocks of nature.,Discover more about the Higgs boson and the world’s largest science experiment in our new exhibition,

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-quantum/,Dr Sebastian Weidt,Could quantum computers change the world?,Dr. Sebastian Weidt explores a new TW live event at the Science Museum.,At the Museum,"computing,Events,live science,Science Museum,technology,Tomorrow's World","Teleportation is real, Schrödinger’s cat can really be dead and alive, and something can be in two places at the same time. Now, before you get too excited, unfortunately scientists have not found a way to make these things happen on the human scale yet. But, and this is a big but, it turns out that in the ‘quantum world’ – where the counterintuitive or, as Albert Einstein put it, ’spooky’ rules of quantum mechanics take over and for example govern the behaviour of the very small such as individual atoms – this is all possible. In short, quantum is strange, to say the least, and no one can yet claim to fully understand every aspect of it.,Nevertheless – and unknown to many – quantum effects, in a rather uncontrolled way, are at the heart of many of our most widespread used technologies. For example, the transistors in our computers and mobile phones work because of quantum effects, as do lasers such as the ones used in DVD drives. What is exciting now is that we have gained the ability to control these quantum effects to an exquisite level and engineer them in such a way that we can develop completely new technologies termed ‘quantum technologies’, which may completely change our lives. Examples of such new technologies include: ultra-sensitive sensors; imaging devices which can ‘see’ around the corner; and communication devices that can secure our data from being stolen, to name but a few.,The quantum computer is another new quantum technology that is seen by many as the Holy Grail, in part due to the difficulty of building one, but also due to its potentially unimaginable computational power which we are only beginning to unravel. The quantum computer uses quantum bits or ‘qubits’ instead of bits as the carrier for information.,While a classical bit in a standard computer can be either 0 or 1, the qubit in a quantum computer can be 0, 1 or both at the same time. This together with another strange quantum effect called ‘entanglement’ gives the quantum computer its power and makes for a device that has the potential to solve some of humanities most difficult computational problems – problems that would take even the most powerful supercomputer currently available millions of years to solve.,This could provide the ability to develop new medicines and materials, break some of the most widely used encryption protocols – for example, those used to protect our bank details – and unravel some of nature’s deepest secrets.,Have we found the most exhilarating applications yet? I don’t think so. We are only at the beginning of understanding the impact of this completely new technology. Consider that when the first computers were built one of the only applications that could be thought of was code breaking and Thomas Watson, then CEO of IBM, allegedly made his famous 1943 statement, ‘I think there is a world market for maybe five computers’. Look how far this technology has come, with computers now being part of our everyday life.,So where are we now? Small-scale quantum computers already exist! They are being developed around the world by leading academic institutions and exciting new start-ups as well as major corporations such as Google and IBM. You can even remotely program one. The most promising of these currently use small superconducting circuits or trapped ions (charged atoms) as their qubits. These machines are beginning to do some really useful things and one can be hopeful that they will outperform even the fastest supercomputer at a particular task within the next couple of years.,This however is only the beginning. To unravel the true potential of this technology we need to scale it up, which basically means having a lot more qubits – going from tens to millions. This is no mean feat but indeed possible. Working with scientists from around the world, including Google US, my colleagues and I from the
Sussex Ion Quantum Technology Group
recently unveiled the first industrial blueprint for constructing such a large-scale quantum computer.,We are now ramping up efforts to construct such a device at the University of Sussex, a device capable of providing potentially life-changing solutions to some of the great computational challenges. This will of course take time, but I encourage everyone to let their imaginations run wild and imagine what this completely new type of technology based on those strange quantum effects could do for you as we are only at the beginning of discovering its true potential. With a global race to make a large-scale quantum computer a reality, it might be sooner than you think.,Curious as to what this technology that could change the shape of our future experiences looks like? Then why not take a trip to the Science Museum where, as part of the four-month long ‘Could quantum computers change our lives?’ exhibition in the
Tomorrow’s World
gallery, you can become immersed in the exciting world of quantum and get up close to some of the core components of a trapped ion quantum computer.,Dr Sebastian Weidt and scientists from his team at the University of Sussex will be presenting the mysteries and technological advances of quantum computing through a series of
Tomorrow’s World Live
events from 13th – 15th of February."

The Theory of Everything
.,He depicts how Hawking changed from a lazy student into the world’s best known scientist who, as a result of motor neurone disease, has only the use of a few muscles.,Hawking caught pneumonia in 1985 and underwent a tracheotomy but regained the ability to ‘speak’ using a computer operated by a hand switch to painstakingly build up words, sentences and phrases so they could be read out by the voice synthesiser that is now in the museum.,Redmayne’s remarkable dedication to his craft can be seen in this biopic, which is based on the book
Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen
by Hawking’s first wife Jane.,Redmayne describes it as “an incredibly delicate and intricate and quite complicated love story.” One of the most extraordinary dimensions of that story is Jane’s determination to stick with Hawking despite his diagnosis with motor neurone disease, an apparent death sentence, at the age of 21.,The film’s production design department took great pains to accurately recreate the progression of wheelchairs that Hawking used throughout his life, from regular to electric and then one adapted to include a computer and his voice synthesiser.,Redmayne had spent months studying archival material, from books to video; worked with the Motor Neurone Disease Association and a neurology clinic in University College London, meeting some 30 patients; rehearsed the change in his movements as the disease took hold with a dance teacher; and wore prosthetics to show how Hawking had aged and deformed with the disease, such as oversized ears that could, with oversized clothes, make his face look gaunt.,One of the pivotal scenes with Hawking’s first wife Jane (played by Felicity Jones) took 15 minutes during an intense day of filming using a hand switch to operate a replica of Hawking’s synthesiser system, he explained. Though only an edited version of his laborious original effort remains in the film, it speaks volumes about Redmayne’s attention to detail that he was prepared to go so far.,Hawking was so impressed with the film, said Redmayne, that he responded with a generous gift — allowing the filmmakers to swap the synthetic voice they had to create and replace it with his own, trademarked computerized version.,Trying to balance his science with his personal story presented some of the same challenges for the James Marsh, director of The Theory of Everything, as it did for curators three years ago, when the Science Museum put on
an exhibition
to celebrate Hawking’s
70th birthday
.,While
Stephen Hawking
might be a celebrity, he is first and foremost a scientist and not only that but a theoretical physicist, one who deals with ideas rather than something tangible like technology. Redmayne admits that it was daunting getting the right balance between science and entertainment.,Still, the film shows how Hawking first captured the attention of his peers in the late 1960s, working with Roger Penrose (played by Christian McKay) on how the laws of physics – notably Einstein’s law of gravity – sometimes break down, resulting in something called a spacetime
singularity
. If general relativity was correct, they showed, then such singularities must occur inside black holes – and, most probably, at the start of the universe,This idea implies that singularities mark the beginning and end of space and time, which was created during the Big Bang and breaks down within black holes, where it is necessary to incorporate quantum theory – the theory of the very small – in order to understand what is really going on.,The film makes much of how Hawking was determined to find “a simple eloquent explanation” for the universe. One of Hawking’s long-standing goals has been to blend the theory of the very big (general relativity) with the very small (quantum theory) to produce an overarching theory known as quantum gravity.,As the film points out – with the help of its consultant, Jerome Gauntlett, former PhD student in Stephen’s group, who is now Head of the Theoretical Physics Group at Imperial College London –  Hawking moved on to a more radical formulation which incorporates some aspects of quantum theory, the no boundary idea, which says that the entire history of the universe, all of space and time, forms a kind of four-dimensional sphere. Thus speculation about the beginning or end of the universe is as meaningless as talking about the beginning or end of a sphere.,One strange consequence of quantum theory is that empty space isn’t empty at all: pairs of particles are constantly popping into and out of existence. If they appear on the event horizon – the point of no return from the gravity well of a black hole – they may find themselves on different sides, with one sucked in, and the other zooming free as “Hawking radiation.”,There’s a scene in the film showing when Hawking gets a sweater trapped halfway over his head and has an insight that leads to this discovery. “Hawking radiation is widely considered to be the single most important insight into quantum gravity that has been discovered so far,” says Gauntlett, who also helped to bring Redmayne up to speed with Hawking’s science.,The director James Marsh told me that he sees the movie as a human story first and foremost but he does hope, as does Gauntlett, that it will encourage those who are intrigued by the science to find out more. “To be honest, dramatic film is not the best place to explore theoretical physics” Marsh explained. “The idea was to make the science universally available and that meant simple. Better that than address a snobbish or elitist audience. Better that a 14 year old boy or girl watches the film and is intrigued to find out more.”,One way he used to lay out scientific thinking in lay terms was to allow the character of Jane to do some explaining, rather that Stephen himself. But, of course, Hawking himself has provided the most stellar example of how to bridge the gulf between the public and cosmologists with A Brief History of Time, which has sold more than 10 million copies worldwide. To celebrate this remarkable achievement, a copy can be found in the Cosmos and Culture gallery."

While it might seem more conventional to head down to the local discotheque and hope the love of your life spots you pulling some sweet dance moves on a Friday night, this hasn’t always been the chosen method for everyone.,This
‘Orris root’ amulet
was recommended to be worn around the neck to ‘find and hold love’.,Although it could be argued that adorning oneself with a chunk of root is not the best way to win someone’s heart, Orris root was used by those who regard the plant as having magical properties that could be used for attracting a date.,But Orris root (or more specifically the dried rhizome of the Iris plant), has many other uses, including as an ingredient in Moroccan spice mixture Ras el Hanout and in many gin recipes.,Essential oil made from the plant is widely used as a fixative in the manufacture of perfumes and Orris root powder is used to the same effect in potpourri. Fixatives work by reducing the evaporation rate of perfumes, increasing odour strength and making the scents last longer.,Scent is widely known to be a
factor in attraction
. A good scent, let’s say a delicious smelling tagine, might help a potential date form positive opinions of you. A great smelling perfume can give a wearer more confidence or even enhance your natural scent.,Orris root is widely grown and is itself aromatic by nature (it is said to have a very pleasant violet scent) which could account for why it has so many applications, particularly those linked to courtship.,For the Greeks and Romans, swans were closely associated with feelings of love. This stems from the myth of Zeus seducing Spartan queen Leda (leading to the birth of the beautiful Helen of Troy) as a swan and the animal’s close association with goddess of love, Aphrodite or Venus.,This
feeding bottle
(part of the Wellcome Collection, which is cared for by the Science Museum) is an example of a swan motif being used to express love.,But if you are not ready for kids and you’ve managed to woo the love of your life with the Orris root, then you’ll be grateful you are prepared – with this

th
Century animal gut condom
, handily packaged in a wax envelope for easy transportation.,The demand for contraception is not a recent phenomenon. One means of contraception, condoms, have been made from a
variety of materials
over the centuries. Linen, tortoiseshell and animal horn has all been employed and since the Renaissance, condoms like
this one
(usually made with the treated intestine or bladder of animals) have been used.,The issue with condoms historically, was that they were only somewhat effective in providing protection against pregnancy and even less effective at providing protection against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).,In 1717 Daniel Turner, a physician often regarded as England’s first dermatologist, recognised this in a treatise he published calling for a ban on condoms. He noted that condoms sometimes prevented pregnancy, encouraged people to have sex and that they provided little protection against STDs such as syphilis.,Despite this, people like to do what they like to do and the market for and use of condoms stayed alive. In 1839 Charles Goodyear learnt how to make natural rubber more malleable and by 1855 the first rubber condom was created.,Animal gut condoms initially remained more popular, particularly as they provided more sensitivity for the wearer. However, the obvious benefits of rubber condoms (they were cheaper and less likely to tear) won out eventually.,With the discovery of Latex in 1920, a new wave of condom technology was ushered in. Leading to today’s condom, which offers protection from both pregnancy and some STDs if used correctly. You can see more condoms in our collection
here
.,Throughout history, those who did catch syphilis or other STDs have turned to various materials and sources of medical knowledge to ‘treat’ their sexual ailments. Though often these treatments may have just assisted with alleviating symptoms for a while.,Calomel was a popular drug from the 1800s. It was used as an antiseptic and laxative during the First World War, but also taken by those suffering from syphilis. Calomel is otherwise known as mercurous chloride, and as it contained mercury, the tablets would more likely poison you slowly than treat a venereal disease.,These tablets

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/finding-pluto/,Alison Boyle,Finding Pluto,,Collections and Objects,"astronomy,space","Eighty years ago today, a young American astronomer discovered tiny Pluto. Clyde Tombaugh was searching for a predicted ‘Planet X’ that might explain oddities in the orbits of Neptune and Uranus.,Tombaugh spent months painstakingly photographing the same sections of sky and studying the images with a
blink comparator
. On 18 Feburary 1930, he noticed that on photographs taken a few nights apart that January, one ‘star’ had moved, indicating that it was actually a nearby object moving against the fixed background of distant stars. Further observations confirmed the discovery, which was announced to the world that March.,Despite the fanfare, Pluto turned out not to be Planet X – Tombaugh had just been looking in the right place at the right time. Subsequent observations revealed that Pluto was too small to match the predictions. Eventually, revised calculations of Netpune and Uranus’s orbits removed the need for Planet X altogether.,Things got worse for Pluto by the 2000s, with astronomers discovering a slew of similarly-sized bodies beyond Neptune. Either our Solar System had a lot more planets than anyone had realised, or it was time to rethink what counts as a planet. On 24 August 2006 the International Astronomical Union voted on
a new definition
, demoting Pluto to ‘dwarf planet’.,‘Save Pluto’ campaigns were quick to follow. This bumper sticker was one of the first products to go on sale.,However, it didn’t take very long for someone to come up with a response:,The IAU’s definition of ‘planet’ remains controversial, so there may be hope for Pluto yet. Because it’s so faraway and faint we still know very little about it, but a spacecraft called
New Horizons
is due to fly by in 2015. It’s carrying some of Tombaugh’s ashes.,You can see the bumper stickers and the photograph in Cosmos & Culture, while a detector for New Horizons is on display in

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/sending-a-car-to-mars/,Doug Millard,Sending a car to Mars,Curator Doug Millard explores why the launch of SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket was so significant for space exploration. ,"Collections and Objects,Science in the news","engineering,space,technology,transport","The
SpaceX Falcon Heavy
is the most powerful rocket launched into space since the retired Space Shuttle in 2011.,It is twice as powerful as the Shuttle and is capable of lifting 64 tonnes into a low orbit of the Earth. The
Soviet Energia rocket
was more powerful – capable of putting 100 tonnes into orbit – but flew successfully just the once in 1988 with the 30 tonne unmanned
Buran shuttle
.,The increased lifting capacity of Falcon means it can launch far bigger payloads including powerful
communications satellites
that will bring broad band capabilities to remote communities around the Earth.,There is a simple rule of thumb in the space business that the maximum size of your spacecraft is limited to what you can fit in the rocket – bigger rocket, bigger spacecraft.,Back in May 1969, NASA’s mighty
Saturn V rocket
launched the
Apollo 10 spacecraft
; the combined weight of its command, service and lunar modules plus the upper stage of the rocket that blasted that spacecraft complex out of Earth orbit and on towards the Moon was 120 tonnes, so Falcon Heavy is still only half as powerful as that space age behemoth.,However, the next
SpaceX
rocket – the BFR (the
Big Falcon Rocket
) will be larger still and able to lift 150 tonnes into Earth orbit. This will open the door to human-rated missions to the Moon and one day to Mars.,Back in the 1960s and early 1970s while the United States was launching its Apollo rockets to the Moon the Soviet Union was attempting the same with its N1 booster.,One of the problems the Soviets faced was ensuring all 31 engines on the N1’s first stage fired successfully together. This was never achieved so Falcon Heavy’s 27 engines working simultaneously and perfectly at launch is another big deal in space exploration.,And then there was the beautiful choreography of the Falcon Heavy’s two boosters touching back down on Earth after they had done their work.,SpaceX has returned rockets before but never a pair and although the rocket’s central rocket missed its floating target in the Atlantic the reusability of the SpaceX system is being very clearly demonstrated. This means the cost of SpaceX launches will undercut its rivals making it a preferred vehicle for many satellite customers.,Then there is the car: SpaceX’s founder Elon Musk’s own Tesla Roadster.,New rocket systems are usually tested before carrying expensive satellite payloads. The remarkably successful Ariane 5’s debut was a disaster in 2003 when its European Space Agency Cluster mission was blown to smithereens at launch.,New rockets ideally launch dummy payloads, often called boilerplate spacecraft, on their inaugural missions. They are non-functional and used to test the load handling capabilities of the rocket.,﻿
﻿,Musk’s Tesla was performing this role but has achieved far more. It has provided a foreground to the
astonishing live pictures
(watch the video above) of Earth as its rocket looped around in orbit. It is a familiar form – what could be more recognisable than a car – juxtaposed with the serene sight of our own planet.,Fifty years ago astronaut Bill Anders badgered his
Apollo 8 crew
mates Frank Borman and
Jim Lovell
to give him a new film cassette so he could capture the appearance of Earth from behind the Moon.,Earthrise has become one of the defining images of space and while the view of the blue planet is breath-taking it is the stark foreground of the lunar surface that adds to the picture’s power; our planet seemingly small and insignificant against a looming alien presence.,Musk’s Tesla and its space suited mannequin at the wheel is a message of confidence and the everyday.,Yes, spaceflight is hard but he wants to make it less so – opening up the final frontier to new players, new companies and new passengers.,Elon Musk wants humans to reach Mars.,While his Falcon rockets and Dragon spacecraft are already servicing the International Space Station and launching the satellites of paying customers into orbit it is Mars that drives him. His company’s BFR rocket will be capable of making the journey to the red planet and one day perhaps with humans.,We shall then be treated to a new order of views and vistas from space. Will they too continue the familiarisation of the cosmos?"

ISS
) and orbiting the Earth, for six months.,By my reckoning that means it’s clocked about 74,000,000 miles. That’s about 400,000 miles each day. To get into orbit its rocket had to accelerate it to 17,200 mph, the same speed it was travelling at when it started its eventual return to Earth. As it plunged through the atmosphere its surface heated to 1500 degrees C.,You can see the scorching and charring on its surface.,But it also carries a human story; this is the actual spacecraft that took astronauts Yuri Malenchenko, Tim Kopra and Britain’s Tim Peake up to the ISS in 2015 and then returned them safely to the Earth the following year. It was Peake’s first spaceflight, Kopra’s 2nd and Yuri Malenchenko’s 5th. It was the first time two ‘Tims’ had shared a space mission!,My ride home:

June 17, 2016,,Malenchenko, spacecraft commander, brought all of his experience to bear when the craft’s automatic docking system failed on approach to the Station; he took manual control and docked the Soyuz safely. During its return to Earth the spacecraft bucked and tumbled and spun – pretty much like every Soyuz descent; the very best of training couldn’t forewarn Tim Peake of some of the bumps and he glanced for reassurance to his veteran crew mates.,Spaceflight is extremely dangerous; the first manned Soyuz mission ended in tragedy when it crashed to Earth killing cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov. But Soyuz is now a stalwart of human spaceflight.,It was designed in the early 1960s as a three-person replacement to the single seater
Vostok
. Soyuz (‘union’ in Russian), unlike its predecessor, would be capable of subtle manoeuvring, rendezvousing and docking with other spacecraft. It would have been capable of
lunar missions
– an unmanned version called Zond did just that in 1968, the first spacecraft to travel around the Moon and back to Earth.,Now, Soyuz is the only means of ferrying humans to and from the ISS.,This particular spacecraft deployed its parachute, fired its retrorockets and hit the Kazakhstan steppe on 18 June 2016. The film shows the billows of dust thrown up by the rockets’ exhausts.,In early 2017, this Soyuz will touch down at the Science Museum after a 1700 mile journey from Moscow where it has been readied for display by the company that made it, RSC Energia. The journey from Russia will take several days, considerably longer than the ten minutes it would have taken to cover the same distance were it still in space.,ESA Astronaut
Tim Peake
said:,“You do become very attached to your spacecraft because it definitely does save your life, and I’m absolutely delighted that my Soyuz spacecraft, the TMA-19M, is going to be returning here to the UK and may serve, hopefully, as inspiration for our next generation of scientists and engineers.”,I am thrilled that Soyuz TMA-19M will join our world-class collections, and be the first flown, human-rated spacecraft to be acquired by the United Kingdom."

robots
and AI.,The smartphone, the web and their ancillaries would have seemed magic even 20 years ago. So, looking several decades ahead, we must keep our minds open, or at least ajar, to innovations that might now seem science fiction.,There’s been exciting advances in what’s called generalised machine learning. The London-based company
DeepMind
last year achieved a remarkable feat, its computer beat the world champion in the game of Go, and Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh has developed a machine that can bluff and calculate as well as the best human players of poker.,Of course, it’s 20 years since IBM’s ‘Deep Blue’ beat Garry Kasparov, the world chess champion. But Deep Blue was programmed in detail by expert players. In contrast, the machines that play Go and Poker gained expertise by absorbing huge numbers of games and playing against themselves. Their designers don’t themselves know how the machines make seemingly insightful decisions.,The speed of computers allows them to succeed by ‘brute force’ methods. They learn to identify dogs, cats and human faces by ‘crunching’ through millions of images, not the way babies learn. They learn to translate by reading millions of pages of, for example, multilingual European Union documents (they never get bored!).,But advances are patchy. Robots are still clumsier than a child in moving pieces on a real chessboard. They can’t tie your shoelaces. But sensor technology, speech recognition, information searches and so forth are advancing apace.,They won’t just take over manual work, indeed plumbing and gardening will be among the hardest jobs to automate, but routine legal work (conveyancing and suchlike), medical diagnostics and even surgery.,Can robots cope with emergencies? For instance, if an obstruction suddenly appears on a crowded highway, can Google’s driverless car discriminate whether it’s a paper bag, a dog or a child? The likely answer is that its judgement will never be perfect, but will be better than the average driver. Machine errors will occur, but not as often as human error, but when accidents occur, they will create a legal minefield. Who should be held responsible – the ‘driver’, the owner, or the designer?,The big social and economic question is this: Will this ‘second machine age’ be like earlier disruptive technologies, the car for instance, and create as many jobs as it destroys? Or is it really different this time?,The money ‘earned’ by robots could generate huge wealth for an elite. But to preserve a healthy society will require massive redistribution to ensure that everyone had at least a ‘living wage’, and to create and upgrade public-service jobs where the human element is crucial and is now undervalued and demand is huge, especially carers for young and old, but also custodians, gardeners in public parks and so on.,But let’s look further ahead.,If robots could observe and interpret their environment as adeptly as we do they would truly be perceived as intelligent beings, to which (or to whom) we can relate. Such machines pervade popular culture; in movies like Her, Transcendence and
Ex Machina
.,Do we have obligations towards them? We worry if our fellow-humans, and even animals, can’t fulfil their natural potential. Should we feel guilty if our robots are under-employed or bored?,What if a machine
developed a mind of its own
? Would it stay docile, or ‘go rogue’? If it could infiltrate the internet, and the internet of things, it could manipulate the rest of the world. It may have goals utterly orthogonal to human wishes, or even treat humans as an encumbrance.,Some AI pundits take this seriously, and think the field already needs guidelines, just as biotech does. But others regard these concerns as premature and worry less about artificial intelligence than about real stupidity.,Be that as it may, it’s likely that society will be transformed by autonomous robots, even though the jury’s out on whether they’ll be ‘idiot savants’ or display superhuman capabilities.,There’s disagreement about the route towards human-level intelligence. Some think we should emulate nature, and reverse-engineer the human brain. Others say that’s as misguided as designing flying machine by copying how birds flap their wings. And philosophers debate whether ‘consciousness’ is special to the wet, organic brains of humans, apes and dogs, so that robots, even if their intellects seem superhuman, will still lack self-awareness or inner life.,And now a digression into my special interest, and Hans Rausing’s: the cosmos and space. This is where robots will surely be transformative.,During this century, the whole solar system will be explored by flotillas of miniaturized probes, far more advanced than the robot that ESA’s Rosetta landed on a comet, or NASA’s
New Horizons
probe that transmitted amazing pictures from Pluto, 10,000 times further away than the moon.,These two instruments took ten years on their journeys, and the amazing Cassini probe of Saturn is even more of an antique – it was launched 20 years ago. Think how much better we could do today.,And better, too than the ‘Curiosity’ rover on Mars.,Later this century giant robotic fabricators may assemble vast lightweight structures in space, gossamer-thin radio reflectors or solar energy collectors, for instance, using raw materials mined from the Moon or asteroids. But what about human spaceflight? Robotic and AI advances are eroding the practical case.,Nonetheless, I hope people will follow the robots, though it will be as risk-seeking adventurers rather than for practical goals. The most promising developments are spearheaded by private companies. Elon Musk’s Space X, has launched unmanned payloads and docked with the Space Station, and has successfully recovered and reused the launch-rocket’s first stage presaging real cost-saving. He hopes soon to offer orbital flights to paying customers.,Wealthy adventurers are already signing up for a week-long trip round the far side of the Moon, voyaging further from Earth than anyone has been before. I’m told they’ve sold a ticket for the second flight but not for the first flight.,We should surely acclaim these private enterprise efforts in space, they can tolerate higher risks than a western government could impose on publicly-funded civilian astronauts, and thereby cut costs compared to NASA or ESA. But should they be promoted as adventures or extreme sports, the phrase ‘space tourism’ should be avoided. It lulls people into unrealistic confidence.,By 2100 courageous pioneers in the mould of say
Felix Baumgartner
, who broke the sound barrier in free fall from a high-altitude balloon, or Sir Ranulph Fiennes, may have established ‘bases’ independent from the Earth, on Mars, or maybe on asteroids. Musk himself (aged 45) says he wants to die on Mars, but not on impact.,But don’t ever expect mass emigration from Earth. Nowhere in our Solar System offers an environment even as clement as the Antarctic or the top of Everest. It’s a dangerous delusion to think that space offers an escape from Earth’s problems. There’s no ‘Planet B’.,Indeed, space is an inherently hostile environment for humans. For that reason, even though we may wish to regulate genetic and cyborg technology on Earth, we should surely wish the space pioneers good luck in using all such techniques to adapt to alien conditions. They’ll be free from terrestrial regulation and have maximal incentive to do so. Indeed, these spacefarers may spearhead the post-human era, evolving within a few centuries into a new species.,The stupendous timespans of the evolutionary past are now part of common culture, outside ‘fundamentalist’ circles, at any rate, but most people still tend to regard humans as the culmination of the evolutionary tree. No astronomer can believe that. Our Sun formed 4.5 billion years ago, but it’s got 6 billion more before the fuel runs out, and the expanding universe will continue, perhaps forever. To quote Woody Allen, “eternity is very long, especially towards the end.”,So, we may not even be at the half-way stage of evolution.,It may take just decades to develop human-level AI, or it may take centuries. Be that as it may, it’s but an instant compared to the cosmic future stretching ahead.,Moreover, the Earth’s environment may suit us ‘organics’, but interplanetary and interstellar space may be the preferred arena where robotic fabricators will have the grandest scope for construction, and where non-biological ‘brains’ may develop powers than humans can’t even imagine."

Best known as the laminate associated with the 1950s and 60s colour explosion in surface coverings, what’s probably less well known is that it was originally an insulation material for the electrical industry.
Formica
literally stands for ‘for mica’, as it was developed as a synthetic plastic substitute for expensive mineral mica. It was made by binding layers of cloth or paper together with a phenolic resin (originally Bakelite). Engineer Dan O’Conor filed for a patent for it in February 1913 and by May the Formica Products Company (set up by O’Conor and Harold Faber) was already taking orders.,Dark brown Formica was a success, buoyed up by its use for radio casings in the 1920s and 30s, giving the colour, feel and finish familiar to any collector of vintage radio sets. Soon it was furnishing interiors with the glossy, smooth, jet, brown and black style associated with the Deco 1930s.,,Used wherever a tough, easy to clean surface was required, Formica was increasingly popular: found in public buildings, paneling the state rooms aboard the Cunard
Queen Mary
and the walls of Second World War prefab military barracks, used to toughen wooden airplane propellers and, with the growth of youth and café culture after the Second World War, on café tables and kitchen counters everywhere.,Formica’s popularity was challenged in the 1970s, in part by a growing preference for ‘honest’ real-wood finishes and historic designs. By the 1980s however, new ColorCore – Formica with solid colour all the way through – became popular with influential architects, designers and jewellery makers including
Wendy Ramshaw
.,Formica is currently in vogue. One reason for this is its ability to constantly reinvent itself, mimicking wood, stone and just about any colour and pattern. Finishes in the 2013 catalogue reflect current cultural preoccupations and colour trends. Retro-style designs include
‘Citrus halftone’
(released for Formica’s 100
th
anniversary ) and the enduringly popular Charcoal Boomerang, designed by
Brooks Stevens
as ‘Skylark’ for the optimistic 1950s and updated by industrial designer
Raymond Loewy
a few years later. Both indicate Formica’s ability to move with the times and, in its 100
th
year, celebrate its origins and heritage."
https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/alexander-parkes-living-in-a-material-world/,Rachel Boon,Alexander Parkes: Living In A Material World,Rachel Boon blogs on creating a new display to explore the life and legacy of Alexander Parkes.,"Collections and Objects,Exhibitions and Galleries","chemistry,materials,plastics,wroughton","As an Assistant Curator, I get the opportunity to work with thousands of objects – from early supercomputers to model steam engines – to bring their stories to life. About eight months ago I started working on a small display celebrating an anniversary in science, technology, engineering or medicine.,Representing the scale of discovery, invention or the life of an important figure in science in a 2 x 3 meter showcase was going to be a challenge. Not deterred I thought this case was the perfect size to celebrate the life and work of the often forgotten 19
th
century inventor
Alexander Parkes
.,Parkes was born 200 years ago last month (read more about him
here
) and contributed to a vast range of metallurgical and material developments. Awarded a whopping 80 patents, Parkes’ work ranged from electroplating works of art to developing the first semi-synthetic plastic, Parkesine.,We wanted to show both sides of Parkes, one as Parkes experimenting in his laboratory, and the other as Parkes the talented craftsman. All the objects in the display show the interplay between these skills. The most eye catching and shiny object on display is an electroplated vase that Parkes made early in his career while working at Elkington and Co. in Birmingham. Next to that are bars of copper produced during the Parkes’ process, a method of extracting valuable metal from lead.,While working on the project I found Parkes’ legacy hiding around every corner, or at least painted on the walls.,Bread Collective and the community of Hackney Wick worked together on
The Walls Have Ears
project to paint a mural celebrating the industrial history of the area. Why, you may ask is Parkesine, a Birmingham inventor’s miracle material, immortalised on a wall between wasteland and an Overground station? The answer is the Parkesine Company Ltd, opened in Hackney Wick in 1866 to commercialise Parkesine.,During the 19
th
century, desirable materials such as ivory, ebony and tortoiseshell became increasingly rare and expensive. A sustainable replica was required to meet the demand. Not only could Parkesine imitate expensive materials it also changed the face of consumerism and mass-produced goods.,Cheap to produce but moulded into the finery of the day – imitation ivory mirrors or tortoiseshell jewellery – Parkesine opened the door to people from all walks of life to be the proud owners of fancy-looking goods.  Analogous to today’s high street stores imitating designer clothes and accessories. We may proudly walk around in Pri-marni now, but Parkes was changing social aspirations over 150 years ago.,Despite Parkes’ enthusiasm and his ability to raise £100,000 (worth £10 million today) from the great industrialists of the time, the factory filed for bankruptcy after two years. Parkes’ desire to compete against natural rubbers and keep his investors happy affected the quality of the goods produced. There are records of combs deforming after a few weeks and other items exploding!,The final group of 14 objects on display reflect the range of objects Parkes made, from jewellery to cutlery, along with the enchanting variety of coloured pigments used.,One of my favourite objects is a toothed wheel made out of black Parkesine. If used, this small item was more likely to set your factory alight than run machinery! Parkesine is a combination of organic matter – cotton fibre – mixed with chemical nitrates, vegetable oils, camphor and alcohol.  When nitrates get hot they have a tendency to explode, so using Parkesine for anything that creates friction is asking for trouble.,Lucky, the Science Museum also looks after the notebooks of Alexander Parkes in our Archives at Wroughton. Parkes’ scribbles in these notebooks shows more than just his dedication to rigorous experimentation. Imbedded between the pages listing chemical combinations are delicate sketches of British landscapes. This material, along with the objects in store was integral for the 3D and 2D designers without whom this case would not look so captivating.,Producing a display like this is a team effort, with many departments helping to turn hours spent researching and rummaging through stores into a display for visitors. The workshops team were up at the crack of dawn to build and install the display and the conservation team were involved from the start to ensure the objects would be safely displayed. Finally, after months of writing and rewriting text, the ribbon was cut and my first showcase was opened."

Because his career trajectory has been a little random, he feels that he has learned something new at every step.,This is a far cry from the traditional blinkered way of doing science, which he encountered first-hand when he conducted the equivalent of a doctorate at the Institute of Solid State Physics at the Russian Academy of Sciences in Chernogolovka.,A slide from his Nobel lecture shows his 1987 thesis citation was entitled: “Investigation of mechanisms of transport relaxation in metals by a helicon resonance method” (He told the Hay audience: ‘I really have forgotten what is was all about.’),Geim said that many of the six or seven million people worldwide who do professional research are trapped in a style of science that he likens to ‘a railway from your scientific cradle to scientific coffin’, one which is ‘absolutely straight’ and where diversions are not allowed.,In the eighties, ‘I did two or three papers which were cited once or twice by my supervisor, no one else,’ he said. ‘That was the experience of my PhD.’ Bottom line, never torture students with what he calls ‘zombie projects.’,Wind forward to
Radboud University Nijmegen High Field Magnet Laboratory
in the Netherlands where he had ended up, attracted by the greater opportunities and freedom in the West: the
Royal Society
had sponsored a visit to the University of Nottingham during which he achieved more in his first six months than in the previous ‘six years of boredom.’,,One Friday in Nijmegen, two decades of curiosity about the phenomenon of diamagnetism got the better of him. He poured a bottle of water into one of the lab’s powerful electromagnets, some 50 times stronger than a fridge magnet. It was in the evening, when the electricity was cheaper. Lo and behold droplets of water started floating in the powerful magnetic field. ‘It is a ridiculous experiment,’ he conceded. ‘But nobody had come with the same stupid idea.’,His colleagues suggested he now try beer. Instead, his wife and fellow physicist Irina Grigorieva, who accompanied him and their daughter to Hay, ’came up with a brilliant idea.’ He should
try a frog too
, just to underline to scientific sceptics as much as the layperson how everything is diamagnetic.,The Geim family pet hamster Tisha was quickly levitated. Not only did he live to squeak the tale for another three years, he even co-authored a paper with Geim in the journal
Physical B
to, as Geim puts it, ‘acknowledge his personal contribution.’ Geim wanted to ensure his work had real impact rather than swell the ranks of uncited papers.,The rest is history and he won the
‘Ig Nobel prize’
for innovations that make people ‘laugh, then think.’ But ‘behind every joke there is something very serious.’ He shared the Ig Nobel Prize with Sir Michael Berry of the University of Bristol, who had worked with Geim on the
theory of levitation
. Even today, scientists come up to Geim at conferences and say. ‘I have no idea about graphene’ and then talk in delight about his levitating frog.,Geim has since enshrined the idea of the Friday Night Experiment in his way of working. His playfulness and commitment to scientific adventure (‘search, not re-search’) was what attracted Kostya Novoselov to Geim’s laboratory in Holland.,And it was what would take them both on a random walk to the Nobel prize, after a wrong first step by Geim’s first PhD student when he moved to the
University of Manchester
. Da Jiang had arrived from China with poor English and in 2002 Geim gave him a simple project: take a piece of graphite, the stuff of pencils, albeit a chunk worth around £300, and isolate the thinnest sliver he could.,Geim wanted to study a two-dimensional sheet of carbon atoms that had long been posited by theorists, and was predicted to have fascinating electronic properties, but had never been seen. This Friday Night Experiment  was a step in the wrong direction: Da Jiang used a specialised machine to grind the piece of graphene down to a little piece. ‘It was not thin enough’ and Geim asked him to try again. Da Jiang requested another piece of graphite and, given he had reduced the last to dust, ‘You can imagine how excited I was’.,Then Geim’s Ukrainian postdoc Oleg Shklyarevskii took an interest and had an idea: physicists used Scotch tape to clean graphite, which is commonly studied in laboratories. ‘What those guys did not realise,’ explained Geim, ‘was that throwing away the Scotch tape they were throwing away the Nobel Prize as well.’,After rummaging in the bin, pieces of tape emerged coated with ultrathin graphite: not atomic thickness but transparent, which raised the hopes of Geim that graphene could be made. ‘I knew that if it is transparent it must be very, very thin. From the very first moment I knew that we could get with this technique something that has never been studied before.’,Here Novoselov re-enters the story and lo and behold after a year to 18 months, they isolated a hexagonal lattice of carbon atoms. The flat, parallel sheets of carbon atoms in the graphite of pencil lead could indeed be peeled apart to yield a single atomic layer.  (Geim hates calling this the ‘Scotch tape technique,’ which is ‘plebeian.’),Geim’s random, playful leaps across physics are not as effortless as they sound: it takes careful background research to make sense of what many others have done before, do something different, and to describe a novel leap in familiar terms that peers can understand. This exercise in due diligence is not helped by the vast amounts of chaff in the scientific literature: he points out that of the 100,000 or so research papers each year (excluding those from China), half are never cited.,Their first paper about the isolation of graphene was rejected when it was sent to
Nature
. Although one referee remarked ‘this paper does not represent a scientific advance,’ Geim is sanguine about the conservatism of science. Eventually it was accepted and published in the journal
Science
in 2004.,It was astounding that heat energy (‘Brownian motion’) did not shake graphene’s gossamer atomic lattice apart, a hint of its extraordinary properties – miraculous strength, lightness, flexibility – and conductivity too. This material was 100 times stronger than steel and 100 times more conductive than copper, promising a wealth of applications, from supercapacitors and composites to lighting and superfast electronics.,By 2010, the first paper by Novoselov and Geim was cited more than 3,000 times. That same year, they shared the
Nobel Prize
, though Geim says that, in reality, ‘six or seven people’ were behind the breakthrough.,And how did he feel when the call from the Nobel committee came? ‘People were expecting me to win the prize for two or three years before,’ he said. ‘In a sense I was mentally prepared that there would be a call.’ But he messed up the actual timing and did not realise that it would be that particular Monday when the prize was announced. Still, when a female voice with a Swedish accent materialised on his phone to say she had something very important to tell him,’ he immediately replied: “Are you going to tell me that I won the Nobel prize?”,‘Nothing changed that day. I went to work. I had a few drinks. Otherwise, nothing special. ’There were plenty of calls from journalists but ‘it was not very interesting. Journalism is not my favourite profession. Sorry, Roger…they write quicker than they think.’,Today Geim maintains a small, close-knit team of two postdocs and two or three students. He believes in the power of ‘self-organisation’, quickly losing interest in students who do not pass muster. He wants to do science, not admin: ‘I am in the lab several times a day.’ He has resisted the temptation to build an empire.,Even though his work has spawned a £61 million
National Graphene Institute
in Manchester, ‘a good facility’ he is ambivalent about the relatively small scale of the effort compared with rival nations, the sluggishness of the UK response to the race to commercialise graphene, and how the money was spent on the building rather than research (architects, along with politicians, journalists and students attract his ire). ‘It is money put into the British building industry rather than science.’,He has met Chancellor George Osborne a couple of times but quickly lost interest. ‘I am not an industrialist or property developer…my strength is probably being a little bit unconventional…I am not interested in political games.’,Graphene is now ‘more or less done’, he said. His latest research is backed mostly by European Union funding, which he says is more focused on blue sky than immediate returns. Geim has now moved on to creating novel designer materials by assembling the emerging family of two dimensional ‘brothers and sisters of graphene’, including hexagonal boron nitride, fluorographene and so on, in a Lego-like fashion. His hope is that these metamaterials will have extraordinary new properties for instance for quantum computers and much more. The world is entering the era of what he calls ‘Graphene 3.0’.,At a Hay Festival event sponsored by the Royal Society, Director of External Affairs Roger Highfield interviewed Andre Geim, the Nobel prize winner best known for his work on graphene, the subject of an exhibition that will open next year at the
Museum of Science & Industry
, Manchester.

The health messages we receive about being skin and sun aware are well established, and for good reason we should all display caution when out in the sun in order to reduce the risks of developing
skin cancer
.,It may then surprise you to know that in early 20
th
century Europe sunlight was in fact being heralded as a new, progressive medical therapy that had numerous
positive
health benefits. Whether it was via natural means-
Heliotherapy
– or via artificial methods-
Phototherapy
– the medical profession held up light as a powerful and triumphant form of treatment.,The curative potential of light and its discovery as a revolutionary “new” treatment had its foundations in the pioneering work of 19
th
century bacteriologists such as Arthur Downes, Thomas Blunt and
Robert Koch
. Their published works demonstrated the antibacterial properties of light, and as such opened up the field of light therapeutics as a scientifically justified and potentially ground-breaking area of medical treatment.,The ability of light to destroy tuberculosis bacillus, and potentially aid in the treatment of illnesses such as lupus and pulmonary tuberculosis was a particularly exciting medical discovery, especially considering the prevalence of the disease within contemporary industrialised society, and its resistance to most forms of treatment.,However, the increased medicalisation of light and its transfer from a handful of specifically located, sun drenched, natural sanatoriums (
heliotherapy
), to the automated and controlled arena of a hospital, relied heavily on the ability to artificially harness UV rays (
phototherapy
). This was achieved thanks to the pioneering work of Danish physician Neils Ryberg Finsen, who in 1894 developed his eponymous lamp for the treatment of tuberculosis of the skin (
lupus vulgaris
).,Alongside the physical development of the apparatus, Finsen opened a Medical Light Institute in Copenhagen, which researched the impact of the therapy and the efficacy of light as a treatment in general. The institute was part funded by the Danish state; a symbol of the importance placed upon this new therapy and how readily it was accepted as a progressive new treatment with significant medical potential.,Finsen’s lamp used telescopic arms to mimic the beneficial effects of the sun and focus the remedial properties of UV light onto an infected area of skin. His process achieved remarkable results and earned him worldwide notoriety, including the support and patronage of fellow Dane, Queen Alexandra, wife of Edward VII, whilst she was Princess of Wales. Alexandra presented a lamp to the London Hospital in 1900, and thus helped establish a light therapy department within the UK. This lamp is now part of the
Science Museum’s
collection. Finsen’s work was further recognised in 1903, when he was awarded the
Nobel Prize for Medicine
.,Finsen’s ground-breaking work, and the positive results it achieved in treating tuberculosis of the skin, did much to sow the seeds for light therapies acceptance within both medical and popular society, and solidify its reception as a regenerative medical cure. The zenith of light therapies popularity came in the 1920’s/30’s, when numerous tanning apparatus’ were sold to the domestic market in a heavily glamorized manner.,Upon being awarded his Nobel Prize, it was commented that Finsen deserved the “eternal gratitude of suffering humanity”, yet his lamp was gradually phased out upon the discovery of antibiotics. Although light therapy is still used today, notably for the treatment of Seasonal Affective Disorder, the negative impact of excess UV light on skin creates a challenging tension with its notion as a universally healing force. A very ambiguous impression of light within a medical sphere therefore emerges; to one which simultaneously emphasises its benefits, whilst also warning us of the deleterious effects of over exposure.,Jack Mitchell, the Science Museum’s Assistant Curator of Medicine, takes his cue from the summertime and explored the Sun’s great influence in the history of medicine."

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/alexandergrahambell/,Charlotte Connelly,Bell’s Heart On The Line,,Collections and Objects,"communication,music and sound","The 14 February 1876 is a very significant date in the history of the telephone. On that day both Alexander Graham Bell and Elisha Gray filed papers with the US Patent Office for a working telephone. Following a dispute Bell’s patent was granted and published on the 7th of March 1876. Recently some
historians
have suggested that the dispute may have been resolved so quickly because Bell found a way to incorporate some of Gray’s ideas into his patent applications – but what could have driven Bell to such deception?,Only three months earlier Bell had been forced to make a difficult decision; should he choose to marry the love of his life, or continue work on his telephone? Bell’s day job was teaching deaf people to speak, and his interest in the production of sounds had stimulated an interest in electrical science. He had been researching a ‘harmonic telegraph’ and, since June 1875, investigating the telephone after an accidental discovery that enabled him to transmit and receive sounds. The father of Mabel Hubbard, one of Bell’s students, became interested in Bell’s harmonic telegraph and offered financial support which Bell accepted while also remaining committed to his teaching. Meanwhile, Bell was becoming aware that his feelings for Mabel were turning from a teacher and pupil relationship towards those of love for her.,Bell’s decision came in November 1875 when Mabel’s father, Gardiner Hubbard, asked Bell to give up teaching and other researches and devote all his time to the telegraph. If he did so, Hubbard would provide his living expenses enabling Bell to marry. Bell was too proud to accept a handout and rejected the offer, writing:,You are Mabel’s father and I will not urge you to give – nor will I accept it if offered – any pecuniary assistance other than that we agreed upon before my affection for Mabel was known … I shall certainly not relinquish my profession until I find something more profitable (which shall be difficult) nor until I have qualified others to work in the same field.,Fortunately for Bell the Hubbard family accepted the situation and allowed Mabel to make up her own mind. Two days later she and Bell became engaged.,Although Bell had not been prepared to accept Gardiner Hubbard’s money, he took the hint and looked again at the harmonic telegraph. Alongside this work he also continued research into the telephone against Gardiner Hubbard’s wishes, for he was convinced he could make it work. His work on the telephone gained some urgency when he became aware that he had a competitor in Elisha Gray, and furthermore because he still did not have enough money to marry Mabel. Bell’s submission of his patent papers on the 14 February, the same day as Gray submitted his, shows how close the race was. If Bell did indeed make illicit additions to his papers, perhaps it is because he was driven by his desire to marry Mabel Hubbard, which he finally did in July 1877."

Being classically trained in music and music theory I have had to write a score and use musical notations on many occasions, but I never knew that a typewriter could be used to write sheet music.,The Musicgraph or Musikriter, was invented by Lily Pavey,
patented
in 1961 and completed in 1963. Pavey was the first inventor to receive National Assistance to enable her to continue working on this project.,It is a typewriter that when you strike the key, as on any normal typewriter, it sounds a note of music and prints the note in the proper place on music paper. The machine could write vertically as well as horizontally, meaning that anyone could fundamentally teach themselves the basics of music theory.,Lily Pavey knew that other people had tried to perfect a musical typewriter but failed, however she was not a trained engineer. She studied music and mathematics and the mechanisms of the typewriter and electronics. She figured out how to give vertical elevation with moving the paper and how to create 8000 combinations with 46 keys.,She hoped that more and more composers would be more encouraged to set down their new inspirations and ideas instead of following what had already been written.,It then was put in to production and called the Imperial Pavey Musigraph.,She developed the Musicgraph in to a device called the Spherigraph. Not only was it able to add words to music but it could be used for complicated maths, chemistry symbols and even ballet choreography notation."

In the days before synthesisers, open source software and pirated soft-synths, electronic music pioneers such as
Daphne Oram
had very few resources with which to forge new and exciting sounds. The
use and abuse of reel to reel tape players
, and the splicing of magnetic tape were soon adopted by some of music’s most adventurous minds and became a vital weapon in their war against the sonically mundane. Composers such as
Karlheinz Stockhausen
and
Terry Riley
, and also the
BBC Radiophonic Workshop
were all keen tape splicers, stretchers and loopers.,Nowadays reel to reel tape players are hard to find and incredibly impractical to use. However, their dinky portable cousins, Walkmans, are easier to find, and cassettes are readily and cheaply available in most charity shops. Cassette tapes are fairly easy to modify too, and doing so provides a fun insight into the early development of electronic music and a chance to get in touch with its roots.,Making a tape loop is one of the easiest and most satisfying tape experiments that you can do, and it takes little more than a few bits of a stationery, a steady hand and half an hour of your time. The process is relatively fiddly and the results will be largely dictated by chance (exciting in itself!), but it’s all worth it for the thrill of feeling the spirit of early electronic music experimenters flowing through you. The results are somewhat unpredictable, but sometimes you stumble upon a perfect three or four second-long loop that you can listen to over and over without ever getting bored, its sound appearing change and alter over time…,Step One
:,Fish out an old Walkman from you or your parent’s attic shed or cupboard-under-the-stairs. Everyone has one lurking around somewhere.,Step Two:
Buy a cassette from your local charity shop. Do judge a book (cassette) by its cover, but make sure that you also check that it is held together with screws, as sealed plastic ones are much harder to open. I chose an Ottawan Best Of, partly because it had a great cover, and partly because there wasn’t much else to choose from. However, the cassette turned out to be sealed with plastic, so I had to resort to my backup choice, a home-recorded copy of the soundtrack to the (terrible) 1977 film Black Joy, one of the few examples of British Blaxploitation cinema.,Step Three:
Have a quick browse while you’re there.,Step Four:
Find a tidy place to work (this gets messy) and gather up all of the necessary equipment: a ruler, some sellotape, a pair of scissors and a screwdriver small enough for the cassette’s tiny screws. I have chosen the Science Museum curator’s library.,Step Five:
Take out the cassette’s screws, putting them carefully to one side.,Step Six:
Take off the top half of the cassette, being careful not to disturb any of its mechanisms (the funny metal bit at the front).,Step Seven:
Take out the tape and detach the ends from the white spools.,Step Eight:
Cut a 23.5cm chunk out of the tape.,Step Nine:
Carefully join the two ends of this strip of tape together with sellotape. It is worth taking your time over this bit as the smoother the join is the smoother the sound of the loop will be. Although conversely, sometimes a rhythmic clunk at the end of each repetition can be just what a loop needs to give it shape. I recommend using a tiny piece of sellotape on the underside of the tape and trimming off any excess.,Step Ten:
Carefully place the loop back inside the tape, hooking it around the four white spools: both the larger central pair and the smaller two on each side.,Step Eleven:
Position the tape so that it hooks around all of the spools but is also in front of the cassette’s metal mechanism. It must be held taut, or else it won’t play smoothly.,Step Twelve:
Close up the tape and re-screw the screws. Make sure that the tape is held behind these plastic teeth at the front and not trapped in them.,Step Thirteen:
Listen and enjoy!*,* As many great experimental musicians from
Philip Glass
to
Mark E. Smith
will tell you, repetition can be fascinating. As I have said, this process produces random results which vary in quality so you may have to fiddle around until you find something that works for you. But when you do stumble upon that perfect loop the results are extremely rewarding. And of course, this is only the beginning; there are many more modifications you can make, and who knows where you will end up once the spirits of Oram and Co. have gotten hold of you!,Robert Sommerlad is a

Alva Edison And His Amazing Phonograph!,,"Education,Families","explainers,interactive galleries,music and sound","Jared Keller, a researcher and former Science Museum Explainer, discusses some of our hidden objects and the science behind them.,Today we’re looking at the Sound Section of
Launchpad
and one of my favourite exhibits, “Sound Bite”. If you’re a bit rusty on your Sound Bite science, there is an old BBC refresher course on the principles of sound travelling through a medium/solid.,The important thing to remember is that sound waves can travel through a solid material like a metal rod the same as they can through the air. Proof of this lies in the fact that you can feel the rod vibrating if you pinch it with your fingers. When you bite down, those vibrations are passed up through your teeth, through your jaw, and up into your ear where they vibrate the same bones in the inner-ear that normally vibrate from sound waves in the air.,In 1877 a very ‘bright’ man named Thomas Alva Edison put this principle to use in what he called a
phonograph
. Whereas the more familiar gramaphone
‘records’
are flat two-sided discs of vinyl, Edison’s original phonographs used 10 cm
cylinders
made of soft tin-foil (and later wax).,Whatever you call them, the science is simple: he knew, just like you, that sound travelling through a metal causes it to vibrate. His great insight, was in realising that vibrations in a metal could then be turned back into vibrations in the air – what we normally hear as sounds!,In the drawing above you can see Edison speaking into one of his phonographs. As he spoke into the cone and tube, it captured his voice and funneled it down until it was intense enough to vibrate a small, incredibly sharp piece of metal. As the metal vibrated with the sound of his voice, the soft tin cylinder was rotated underneath the vibrating tip which caused the tip to cut into the tin. If you want to see a real phonograph player and its cylindrical record, simply head to the ‘Secret Life of the Home’ gallery in the basement.,Edison knew that once the vibration of his voice had been carved into the soft tin, passing another tip through those grooves in the now hardened tin would make the needle vibrate in exactly the same way! All he had to do then was take those vibrations and amplify them so they were loud enough to be heard by the human ear. But being the veteran Sound Biters that we are, we know that if Edison had simply attached small metal rods to that vibrating tip we could bite down on them and let the vibrations pass up our teeth, through our jaws, and up to our ears, just like with Sound Bite!,Though maybe Edison was right: listening to a song through the air is much more satisfying than biting down on a metal rod!"

Shelter
to document the poor conditions suffered by many around 1970. He travelled around the UK for four years and photographed people in slum properties in London, Birmingham, Liverpool, Sheffield, Glasgow and other major cities. A selection of these images – 100 out of the 1000 vintage prints held by the
National Media Museum
– can now be seen in the Virgin Media Studio at Media Space.,Detached from the original Shelter context and combined with many images which have never been seen before, Make Life Worth Living does not just show the misery in housing around 1970, but is, in fact, a cinematic narrative of Hedges crisscrossing the UK from 1968 to 1972. The selection is reminiscent of
Robert Frank
‘s groundbreaking book The Americans. Like Frank, Hedges at the time was a true ‘noir’ photographer.,It has been said that Nick Hedges’ work for Shelter is strongly related to the American tradition of social documentary established by photographers like Lewis Hine and
Paul Strand
. Moreover, an analogy can be found in the work of Walker Evans, when he was hired by the Farm Security Administration to document the poor conditions of the farmers in pre-Second World War America.,Hedges also continued the rich tradition of socially committed photography in Britain. In fact, few photographers have captured better than Hedges what is both so upsetting and captivating in the look of Britain around 1970. Yet this is more than the aesthetics of poverty. Hedges’ Britain is at times a gritty place full of shadows, where you get the feeling things may not end well, but you still can’t stop looking.,The images taken outside the derelict houses – street scenes, city and rural landscapes – have a casual, almost drive-by feel. But you quickly see how carefully Hedges chose the images he shot over four years. Signs, interiors, children, and animals keep cropping up, echoing from image to image. These images possess an energy and a visual harshness that contradict what may at first glance be mistaken for objective photojournalism.,It’s not only permissible, but also rewarding to take pleasure in Hedges’ images; the way light falls on a kitchen floor, the terraced houses running down to a factory, the pile of shoes in the window of a second-hand shoe shop, or the vacant stare of a mother holding her baby. When life is hard, which it often is in these photographs, we have to look hard, but when we do, Hedges shows us beauty in many places.,Apart from showing beauty, disconnection and decay, Hedges’ poignant work offer us an important part of Europe’s past and culture. 40 years later, his Shelter archive is an incredibly strong body of work with which Hedges created history with his camera, history that happened in the form of scenes that can now become symbolic archetypes embedded in a national consciousness. Nick Hedges shows us a life worth seeing – the words ‘worth seeing’ in fact being a gross understatement.,Make Life Worth Living: Nick Hedges’ Photographs for Shelter, 1968-72

travel destinations
, Instagram provides a brilliant platform for creating and discovering the images and lives of people from all over the world. It is also a great way for people to meet offline, as the popularity of ‘Instameets’ (events specifically for those who use Instagram to meet and take pictures), prove.,Over the past year or so, museums and galleries from around the world have been
opening their doors outside of opening hours to Instgrammers
, and the results have been stunning. Known as #emptymuseum, these events were pioneered by Instagrammers themselves.,We too have opened our doors early.,The Instragrammers we invited to the Museum saw our current Media Space exhibition,
Revelations: Experiments in Photography
and were given a tour of some of the art in our collection, from Anthony Gormley’s
Iron Baby
, to Thomas Heatherwick’s
Material’s House

Revelations: Experiments in Photography
, tells the story of artists’ changing engagement with early scientific photography, tracking a path through modern, postmodern and contemporary photographic art.,The first room of the exhibition, entitled ‘Once Invisible’, draws on the rich holdings of the
National Photography Collection
and the
Science Museum collections
to explore how early scientific photographs expanded the field of vision during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.,These photographs show the astronomically distant and microscopically small, reveal the nuances of rapid motion, and record the presence of invisible energy sources such as radiation and electricity.
After installing this part of the exhibition, it struck us once again
how truly strange these images still seem
, and quite how alien the world can appear within them.,Highlights include William Henry Fox Talbot’s exquisite photomicrographs, Arthur Worthington’s innovative use of flash to study the forms produced by splashes, Henri Becquerel’s photographs demonstrating the radioactivity of uranium salts, which border on abstraction and photographs by
Étienne Jules Marey
.,“Unlike Eadweard Muybridge, who had no interest in science, Étienne Jules Marey was a qualified doctor and there would have been no Italian Futurist movement without his extraordinary influence. Marey’s representation of locomotion and the movement of animals and human beings is wonderfully exhibited here – perhaps for the first time publicly. There are very few exhibitions where you can see his genius.” –
Sir Jonathan Miller
, speaking at the opening event for Revelations: Experiments in Photography,The pictures can be understood as both product and emblem of an extraordinary moment when new technologies changed experiences of the world in fundamental ways. They are best understood in relation to a wider technological landscape, which included the development of telegraphy, telephony and inter-continental rail travel.,The second room is entitled ‘The New Vision’. Here, visitors are presented with art photography made during a period spanning from the early twentieth century to 1979. It provides a rare opportunity to see iconic and lesser known works informed and inspired by the types of scientific imagery presented in Room 1.,Drawing on numerous loans from museums in the USA and Europe, ‘The New Vision’ includes work by László Moholy-Nagy, Man Ray, Laure Albin-Guillot, Carl Strüwe, Alfred Erhardt,
György Kepes
, Harold Edgerton,
Berenice Abbott
and Hollis Frampton. Seeing these important works come out of shipping crates and onto the walls was a memorable experience.,Many of these artists were drawn to scientific photographs based on the formal principles they suggested, particularly the radically abstract language they made available. For some, the photographs were also symbols of broader changes to culture and society: in the scientific photographs, technology helped to reveal and record things that could not be seen by the naked eye. The abilities of man were surpassed by those of machines.,‘The New Vision’ maps a course through twentieth century art, revealing a gradual shift in the meaning of science and technology. Painted in crude terms, it signals those ways in which an initial enthusiasm gave way to pessimism and uncertainty during the period after the Second World War.,Entitled ‘After the Future’, the final room focuses on the resurgence of interest in the revelations of early scientific photography within areas of art photography today. It includes works by
Walead Beshty
,
Ori Gersht
, Sharon Harper, Joris Jansen, Idris Khan, Trevor Paglen,
Sarah Pickering
,
Clare Strand
and Hiroshi Sugimoto.,By setting the contemporary work apart from that of the modernist artists in Room 2, we highlight the gap that separates our own moment from theirs and the fact that the earlier photographic experiments no longer represent the vanguard of visual culture.,The exhibition thus concludes by posing a series of questions: If the early scientific photographs no longer symbolise the new, what do they mean for artists working today? And what should we make of the widespread interest in the earlier forms and techniques evident in the work of so many contemporary practitioners?,In reply, we point to the wider contexts that may have informed this ‘scientific turn’, particularly the rapid expansion of networked digital technologies, and the profound changes to photography and culture this has involved.,By reflecting on artists’ glance back to photography’s past, we hope to gauge something important about photography’s present.,Dr Ben Burbridge is the co-curator of

Cohen, served up a sell-out event at the Science Museum that danced effortlessly like a Simpsons episode between scintillating story-telling, one-liners and hard-core mathematics.,QI creator John Lloyd, CEO of Innovate UK Iain Gray, and mathematics populariser
Alex Bellos
were among those lured to the museum for an evening of maths and mirth, but it was 12-year-old Toby Hawkins whose question precipitated the eveningís global premiere.,Toby wondered whether we could hope for a Simpsons and Futurama crossover episode if anyone should prove that P does not equal NP and thus solve a major
unresolved problem in computer science
. In response we were treated to the first ever airing of part of a ‘Simpsorama’ crossover show that will see Bender travelling back in time in an attempt to kill Bart so worldwide disaster can be averted.,The evening was expertly compered by
Simon Singh
, author of The Simpsons and their Mathematical Secrets. He invited Al Jean and David X. Cohen to explain how and why they have regularly embellished episodes of both series with references to degree-level maths such as
Fermatís Last Theorem
or the
Taxicab number
.,Al Jean, who worked on the first series and is now executive producer of The Simpsons, and studied maths at Harvard, credited serendipity; many of the writers had scientific backgrounds. He went on to suggest that mathematics and comedy writing demand the same kind of thinking and a similar, sometimes obsessive, quest for the perfect solution.,We heard how, in the early 90s, the writers faxed a mathematician working at NASA to ensure the accuracy of a line by store owner Apu Nahasapeemapetilon when he boasts ‘I can recite pi to forty thousand places. The last digit is 1.’,David X Cohen
, creator of Futurama who happens to have a computer science degree from UC Berkeley, hinted at a more serious purpose. Lamenting the way entertainment goes out of its way to make maths seem boring, he said ‘part of what I think about when we do Futurama is let’s make it fun, let’s not make it scary’.,Earlier, Science Museum Deputy Director Jean Franczyk had provided the context for the evening with a reminder of the Science Museum’s ambitious plans for a new
mathematics gallery
, made possible by the generosity of the David and Claudia Harding Foundation. By combining the curation of David Rooney, the
creativity of Zaha Hadid Architects
and the museum’s beautiful maths collection, Jean predicted a gallery that would delight all, including the ‘intrepid and maths-loving Lisa Simpson’.,The event has inspired a wide range of media interest, on the
importance of Lisa as a mathematical role model

links between mathematics and comedy

Skin is removed from a healthy part of the patient’s body, then punctured with minuscule holes to help new skin growth and placed over the burn wound.,It is a tried and tested procedure, but it can be slow and prone to scarring and infection.,SkinGun, uses a gentler, less invasive approach.,Stem cells are first removed from a postage stamp-sized sample of the patient’s skin. They are then added to a liquid suspension, which is sprayed as a fine mist onto the wound, using the SkinGun.,Spraying allows skin to regrow uniformly across the wound, rather than just from the outside in. It leads to faster, less painful skin growth, and it can take as little as 90 minutes to complete the whole procedure.,Although for the moment it has only been used on second-degree burns, there is evidence it could be effective on other skin wounds and ailments.,Sound like Star Trek to you?,The SkinGun has been in development for about a decade, and it has been tested successfully on 60 patients.
RenovaCare
, the company behind it, are currently in the process of applying for permission to use it in routine clinical practice, both in the US and Europe – meaning it could come to a hospital near you sooner than you think.,By lightly spraying the patient’s own stem cells onto the scarred tissue, and prompting fast and organic skin regrowth, it could be a life-changing piece of tech for the over 140 million people worldwide who currently suffer from severe burns, scarring and other skin defects or disorders.,SkinGun will be on display in our interactive

, Vantablack (named from Vertically Aligned NanoTube Arrays) could help telescopes see further, although BBC One’s The One Show had

Instead of being reflected, light striking Vantablack becomes trapped within the forest of carbon nanotubes, eventually emerging as infra-red light (heat). Because so little light (just 0.04%) is reflected, the human eye struggles to see shadows or contours on its surface, which is why it even makes 3D objects appears flat.,#Vantablack

World Antibiotic Awareness Week
that begins today (13 November),
Superbugs: The Fight For Our Lives
has opened in the Science Museum to highlight humanity’s response to the unprecedented global threat of antibiotic resistance.,The exhibition examines antibiotic resistance at the microscopic, human and global scale, featuring remarkable scientific research from across the globe and revealing the personal stories of those waging war on superbugs – those disease-causing
bacteria
that have evolved to be resistant to common antibiotics.,At the official opening we were joined by 150 guests, from journalists and medical professionals to the Department of Health and members of academia, research councils, and the pharmaceutical industry.,Presenter Angela Rippon spoke passionately about the power of antibiotics to save lives, including her own, and economist Lord O’Neill gave an update on the recommendations of his landmark 2016
Review on Antimicrobial Resistance
.,Ian Blatchford, Director of the Science Museum, welcomed guests to the museum. He said: ‘As the home of the greatest medical collection in the world, it is fitting that the Science Museum is opening an exhibition on antibiotic resistance. With the resurgence of diseases once thought banished to history books, this exhibition shines a light on the remarkable scientific research that could stop the spread of the superbugs.’,Antibiotics, which were first turned into drugs
thanks to pioneering work at the University of Oxford
, are an unusual class of drugs in that the more that they are used, the faster resistance develops, which limits their utility.,Superbugs: The Fight For Our Lives
features nine bacteria
classified by the World Health Organisation
as posing the greatest threat to human health:
Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis
and
Enterobacter cloacae.,‘You will be pleased to know that these bacteria
were
harmed in the process of making this exhibition,’ said Blatchford.,Erik Nordkamp, Managing Director of Pfizer UK, which is the exhibition’s Major Sponsor and continues research in the field that saw the company first mass produce penicillin in the UK in the 1950s, said: ‘We can’t take antibiotics for granted. We’re proud to support this important exhibition, which helps to raise awareness of the scale of this global health challenge.,As the exhibition highlights, no one person or organisation has all the answers, nor is there one solution. Industry, governments, and health providers must work together to create the policies, educational programmes and medical interventions needed to win the fight against the superbugs.’,Angela Rippon, who championed antibiotics in the BBC2 programme
Britain’s Greatest Invention
, winning the popular vote, said: ‘I owe my life to antibiotics  because as a child I contracted TB.’ She argued that antibiotics was the greatest invention because we would not be able to enjoy the rival innovations ‘if we are dead. Antibiotics have saved millions of lives. They are a modern medical miracle.’,She added that the exhibition is a ‘wake-up call’ and shows that a quarter of the world’s population are infected with tuberculosis (TB, in a latent form), with drug-resistant TB now an issue for many countries. On display in
Superbugs
are 14,000 pills, illustrating the two-year treatment needed to combat superbug TB.,,Lord O’Neill summed up the progress made since he reported on the extend of the problem last year, warning that if no action is taken the death toll caused by superbugs could rise from 700,000 to 10 million annually by 2050, and lose ‘a staggering 100 trillion dollars of GDP.’ When it comes to new vaccines and drugs, there is ‘a lot of talk’ but ‘as of yet I don’t really see any real initiatives,’ said Lord O’Neill. ‘We have to ‘stop treating antibiotics like sweets.’,He added we need fast, cheap and reliable diagnostics, a challenge that is being met by the
UK’s Longitude prize
. He also called for greater public awareness. ‘What better than this’, said Lord O’Neill, motioning to the
Superbugs
exhibition, which he thinks should now tour the world. The museum is exploring plans to tour the exhibition abroad.,Thirty years since the last new class of antibiotics were approved for human use, scientists are hunting for new antibiotics in unusual places. Visitors can see Komodo dragon blood and watch as University of Illinois researchers
dive into Icelandic fjords
, both potential sources of new antibiotics.,,Brazilian leafcutter ants are also on show in the exhibition, curated by Sheldon Paquin. University of East Anglia scientists believe superbug-killing antibiotics produced by bacteria which live on the ants may be another source of antibiotics.,One of the figures who helped inspire the exhibition was Dame Sally Davies,
Chief Medical Officer for England
, who could not attend the launch but was taken around the exhibition earlier by Roger Highfield, Director of External Affairs, before he introduced her at a special session on superbugs he curated at a
Wired Live event
in Tobacco Dock.,Dame Sally
emphasised the need to act
:  we inappropriately use antibiotics worldwide (in the case of at least 1 in 4 prescriptions for people the UK) and much of the use in agriculture is for growth promotion as a substitute for good hygiene practices: in the United States, antimicrobial use in food animals is estimated to account for ∼80% of the nation’s annual use of antimicrobials.,She added that resistant bugs don’t respect borders; and why challenging science and market failures have led the pipeline of new antibiotics to dry up.,If we lose the battle against superbugs, it will change life as we know it:  antibiotics are needed to not only treat infection, but to preserve modern medicine.  Operations such as transplants, chemotherapy and caesareans rely on antibiotics to prevent infections from emerging in these patients while their immune system is compromised.,Dame Sally concluded: “This exhibition clearly highlights some of the key issues we are trying to address, and crucially, tells stories about real people. People cannot connect with this threat without seeing how it affects them or those around them. I strongly encourage people to visit and find out more about superbugs and how they can help tackle the issue.’,Superbugs: The Fight For Our Lives
is free and open daily until February 2019, with late opening (18.45 to 22.00) on the last Wednesday of each month for
Lates
. The exhibition is supported by Pfizer (Major Sponsor) and Shionogi (Associate Sponsor) with additional support from UK Research and Innovation and the University of East Anglia."

, is a culmination of a five day celebration that represents the triumph of good over evil and marks the beginning of a new year in the Hindu calendar. Gifts of delicious sweet meats, serenades of devotional songs, fantastic firework displays and dazzling diyas (lighted lamps) are in abundance and all play a role in making Diwali such a unique celebration.,In many households the celebration of Diwali is not complete without a retelling of the

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/space-for-all-of-us/,Simonetta Di Pippo,Space for all of us: celebrating 50 years of the Outer Space Treaty,"Simonetta Di Pippo, Director of UNOOSA, explains the history and importance of the Outer Space Treaty ","Exhibitions and Galleries,Science in the news","communication,engineering,exploration,physics,space","Fifty years ago, on 10 October 1967, the Treaty of Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies – more commonly known as the
Outer Space Treaty
– entered into force. 24 countries ratified this treaty in 1967, and since then, the number of parties to the treaty has increased to 105.,So, why is the Outer Space Treaty important?,The treaty, which serves as the basis of international space law, covers several topics, such as ensuring that nations are held responsible for their activities in space and are liable for damage caused by objects launched into space. It also prohibits nations from placing weapons of mass destruction in outer space. Furthermore, it states that the exploration and use of outer space is the province for all humankind, and no country can lay claim to the Moon or any other celestial body.,These concepts, that space is for everyone and should be used and explored peacefully, came at a pivotal time in the 1960s, when there was geopolitical tension and conflict, alongside calls for disarmament and peace. The treaty was progressive because it helped maintain peaceful and orderly exploration and use of outer space at that time, and now.,With the treaty in place, the exploration of space began to serve another purpose; space facilitated international cooperation. Nations that had political differences worked together for scientific progress and to better understand the universe around us. While we may disagree on Earth, what we can achieve together in space is inspiring. Space unites us towards common goals. This is what we call ‘space diplomacy’.,Half a century later, we at the
United Nations Office of Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA)
– the main UN entity dealing with outer space – continue to uphold the principles of the treaty. We facilitate ongoing international cooperation on space matters, including by supporting the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space.,We also work to ensure that all humankind benefits from space activities, particularly developing countries and non-space-faring nations. This includes helping countries to access and use space technology for sustainable development, such as monitoring and adapting to climate change, mapping the spread of diseases, or monitoring crops to ensure food security.,With so much of our lives now reliant on space technology, and the huge benefits that it brings to our societies now, and in the future, it is imperative that space continues to be the common domain of all humanity and is maintained for peaceful purposes. The Outer Space Treaty of 1967 is the foundation of these principles.,The Treaty’s 50th anniversary is an opportunity to remember the historical origins of the treaty, celebrate the international cooperation and achievements it has facilitated, and look ahead to an exciting future of space activities for the benefit of all humankind, for another 50 years and beyond. The Treaty is a commitment from the international community to preserve space peacefully, for all of us, and the generations to come."

Producing stuff is arguably faster and cheaper – in terms of materials and labour at least – than it has ever been before.,Most things become gradually cheaper to produce, as manufacturing processes speed up and become mechanised. It goes without saying that consuming things has followed the same line.,This leaves to one side the huge issue of the often ‘hidden’ environmental costs of producing goods in terms of environmental and human impact: from toxic by-products of much of the dying and cotton industries to increasing quantities of plastic waste and growing evidence that plastic particles are impregnating our wildlife, our food and ourselves.,The seamy, dark and dirty side aside however, what cannot be ignored, is the enormous impact the democratisation of access to consumer goods, has had on society.,Our lives are more comfortable, our homes warmer, our
fridges
more well stocked than ever before. We can access cheap medicine, cheap food, cheap clothing.,Via our transport networks (admittedly increasingly clagged up), smart phones and a whole raft of wired up technologies, we travel both physically and by eye, ear and mouth more rapidly and more easily than would have been though possible even 20 years ago: sharing thoughts, feelings, ideas.,The palpable excitement of the possibilities and opportunities brought by such an explosion of ‘stuff’ – both real and virtual –  is countered by the sense in which it is also overwhelming. There are some truly jaw-dropping stats out there.,The average American home contains an estimated
300,000 items
; whilst the average British ten-year old owns
238 toys
but hardly plays with any of them.,Given the immediacy of consumption, it’s all too easy to forget just how ingenious many of the products, gadgets and home appliances are; how much scientific exploration and technological innovation, trial and error has gone into them; and how they have impacted on our lives.,If you have time over your
cup of tea
(made courtesy of a mass-produced automatic
kettle
with safe integral heating element), spend a moment to reflect (reading on your
smart phone
,
tablet
or
computer screen
) on how many of the following inventions you use and how your day-to-day life would be different without them.,The light bulb,You wake up on time – thanks to your battery-powered
alarm clock
and fumble around for the light switch. Luckily, thanks to the marvellous invention of the lamp bulb in the 1870s you can do this almost instantaneously, rather than having to find a friction match (another amazing invention by chemist John Walker in the early 19
th
century) and a candle.,The development of a whole raft of technologies – glass blowing, how to create a vacuum in which the bulb filament could burn, how to choose the right material to make the filament burn constantly and brightly – came together in the 19
th
century: making possible the invention of a practical lamp bulb by both Brit
Joseph Swan
and American Thomas Edison in the late 1870s.,Although technology has moved on today with long-lasting, low energy LED’s rightly taking over the market, we owe a debt of gratitude to the early adopters of lighting technologies who showed just how much demand there was for safe, efficient lighting around the home.,The bicycle,Fumbling around for some change you realise that you need to head to the bank for cash. Luckily you can get there fast on your speedy two-wheeler. Early
bicycles
such as the ‘velocipede’ or ‘
boneshaker
’, although admittedly uncomfortable, were ground-breaking: giving new freedom to the average late 19
th
century person – at least if you happened to live near suitable road.,It was one factor in the contemporary emergent emancipation of women. If you want to revisit some of the enthusiasm surrounding early bicycle riding you could do worse than to read the 1900 classic: J K Jerome’s Three Men on the Bummel (his follow up to the hit Three Men in a Boat). Jerome’s three heroes engage with the new biking craze and cycle eventfully around Germany’s Black Forest.,Today we are taking to our bikes in increasing numbers, viewing it variously as a green mode of transport and an increasingly viable alternative to a fume-clogged car journey.,Bank card,Luckily the
ATM cash machine
has money so you push in your card and withdrawn a tenner. Since the first ATM (automated teller machine) was opened in Enfield, North London in June 1967 they have become an indispensable part of modern life, freeing us from the inevitable queue at the bank.,Printed newspaper,Holding your tenner you head to the shop to purchase a can of soup for lunch and a printed newspaper. Now broadly overtaken by online news sites it is hard to appreciate just how technologically-advanced the printing of a newspaper used to seem. When the first high-speed steam-driven printing press by Koenig and Bauer was secretly tested out in London in 1814 for
The Times
newspaper everything changed and the printed media never looked back. The new
printing press
could mass produce newspapers – printing on both sides at speed.,Tin can,Heading home you heat the soup for lunch. The tin can, first mass-produced by Southwark inventor and manufacturer Bryan Donkin, is one of the unsung heroes of food technology, enabling food to be sterilised and kept safely preserved within the tin-lined can.,Soon after ‘tested’ by the British royal family, it became the store-cupboard stalwart of most householders; whilst enabling armies to march and explorers to venture further than ever before for longer than ever before. Today, billions of cans of produce are sold around the world every year.,Fridge,After lunch you put the rest of the can of soup in the fridge. The refrigerator was voted
the
most important innovation in the history of food technology by the Royal Society a few years ago. It is easy to see why.,The fridge has changed our diets and the kitchen landscape forever. It provides a nexus in the home for storing food (transported from all over the world, often in refrigerated transport) more safely than ever before and potentially longer than before: democratising access to food more than any other invention.,Painstakingly and expensively manufactured by hand in the early 20
th
century, once the fridge’s potential was recognised it soon became mass produced. Refrigerator production followed along very similar lines to car production – with the working ‘innards’ inserted into a (usually) steel box, bent into shape from sheet form.,Looking to the future, a present-day production and consumption (r)evolution is already in progress in the form of 3D printing, which looks certain to alter beyond all recognition how things are designed and manufactured and bring individual ‘pimping’ of products to the home.,Wind-up radio,Exhausted, you head for the sofa, but not before grabbing your wind-up radio, this one an early example of a new generation of mass-produced consumer goods developed with sustainability in mind.,Shunning the disposability of many mass-produced goods, they utilise recycled materials and rely on other methods of powering such as solar, clockwork or rechargeable battery.,Or maybe I’ll just use the battery-powered remote and WiFi to watch to Netflix…"

by Tom Clarke of Channel 4 news.,After thanking his agent, editor and wife, the New York born journalist remarked on how, unlike researchers who write popular science books, he felt like he was an outsider with his ‘face pressed against the glass.’,The veteran American writer made a huge debut with his first book, Chaos (1987), an international bestseller which provided insights into the apparent disorder in complex systems and made everyone aware of the extraordinary influence of the ‘butterfly effect.’ Since then he has written Pulitzer-Prize shortlisted biographies of two heroes of science, Richard Feynman and Isaac Newton.,Gleick’s latest work tells the story of information, from the theory of information proposed by American Claude Shannon to the current revolution in biological information, replicated and transmitted in the form of DNA since the origin of life, and the tsumani of data that now engulf us to become the very quintessence of 21st century society.,Along the way the reader encounters many figures that are also celebrated in the
Science Museum
, such as Charles Babbage, inventor of the first great mechanical computer; Ada Lovelace, the dazzling daughter of the poet Byron, who became the first true programmer, and
Alan Turing
, who lay the foundations of modern computing and cracked both the codes of nature and the Nazi war machine.,The stories behind the revolutions that created today’s information age will also form the core of a forthcoming multi-million pound gallery,
Making Modern Communications
, scheduled to open in the museum in 2014.,The judges on this year’s judging panel included the authors Jasper Fforde and Tania Hershman, BBC Commissioning Editor for Science Kim Shillinglaw and Royal Society University Research Fellow Samuel Turvey. The panel was chaired by Professor Jocelyn Bell Burnell, who said the decision was difficult, though unanimous. “The Information “an ambitious and insightful book that takes us, with verve and fizz, on a journey from African drums to computers. It is one of those very rare books that provide a completely new framework for understanding the world around us.”,The prize, award by Society president Sir Paul Nurse, saw off strong competition from a
heavyweight shortlist
:,• Moonwalking with Einstein by Joshua Foer, published by Allen Lane (Penguin Books), on his quest to understand human memory.,• My Beautiful Genome by Lone Frank, published by Oneworld, a personal perspective on personal genetics,• The Hidden Reality by Brian Greene, published by Allen Lane (Penguin Books), which explores parallel universes and the laws of the cosmos.,• The Better Angels of Our Nature by Steven Pinker, published by Allen Lane (Penguin Books), which reveals how, contrary to popular belief, humankind has become progressively less violent over the millennia.,• The Viral Storm by Nathan Wolfe, published by Allen Lane (Penguin Books), which examines the world of viruses and why modern life has made our species vulnerable to the threat of a global pandemic and how to remain ahead of the threat.,Sir Paul remarked that there had been a renaissance of science writing and admitted it was a ‘pity that someone had to win.’ Despite the lack of British writers on the shortlist, many were present in the audience, including Armand Leroi, Tim Radford, Jo Marchant, Martin Rees, Stuart Clark, Helena Cronin, Philip Ball, Graham Farmelo, Alex Bellos and Jim Al-Khalili.,Set up in 1988 as the “Science Book Prizes”, it became the Rhône-Poulenc Prizes for Science Books from 1990 – 2000, then became the Aventis Prizes for Science Books from 2001 – 2006 and the Royal Society Prize for Science Books from 2007 – 2010. Now in its 25th year, the book prize is now sponsored by the global investment management company Winton Capital Management. David Harding, Founder and Chairman , congratulated James Gleick as ‘ a worthy winner in a strong field’ and thanked the shortlisted authors for helping to turn the sea of scientific information into knowledge.,Roger Highfield is an author, editor of book

Marta Leskard, our very own Conervation and Collections Care Manager, had a starting role as an extra! The episode told the story of mass miniature radiography coming to the East End.,These are the first words you read on climbing aboard one of the most magnificent large items in our medical collections – an
x-ray bus
.,During the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, mobile mass miniature radiography units were a common sight on the road, x-raying people for signs of tuberculosis. The disease could present itself with no symptoms at all – making it all the more dangerous for the people around you.,The first words that I uttered on climbing aboard were ‘pens on strings!’ – which surprised both me and my colleagues.,For me, the pens on strings gave a real sense of a human experience. You would fill out your details on the bench and hand them to the clerk in the booth behind you (it’s a bit of a tight squeeze). This card would later hold your miniature x-ray, just 10 cm in height.,It was easy to imagine what the process was like for people. Anyone could have an x-ray free of charge, possibly after seeing a poster, like this one, or just after having spotted a bus on the street.,It turns out I didn’t have to imagine too much as an x-ray bus was featured on Steptoe and Son episode called
‘TB or not TB’
. I think there was some artistic license though – the bus is not quite the tardis it seems on the programme!,Geekily, those pens on strings became the desktop image on my PC for a while –  definitely an indication that I’m in the job!

Call the Midwife
by Jennifer Worth.
Call the Midwife
chronicles the work of the author as a midwife in the East End of London in the 1950s.,As you would expect we have a large collection of objects relating to midwifery and obstetrics. The piece of kit that caught my eye during the TV serialisation of the book is the foetal stethoscope.,Used to listen for a foetal heartbeat, this piece of equipment is a far cry from the electronic heartbeat monitoring that is sometimes used in hospitals today. Thank you to Charlotte Walker for pointing out that the Pinard stethoscope is still in use today.,But how could midwives prepare themselves for the different birthing scenarios might arise? Obstetrical phantoms were one way and hands-on experience the other.,When presented with a difficult birth, midwives dealing with home births in the 1950s often called in for the local doctor, but everything was done either through sound, touch or sight.
With the introduction of the ultrasound scanner, foetuses could be seen before birth. Originally ultrasound had been used for detecting submarines and checking for metal fatigue, before being adapted for medical use by
Professor Ian Donald
in the late 1950s.,For women today, there is a wide variety of choices when it comes to childbirth – home delivery, water births or hospitals. There is also a choice for women as to what equipment is used. What would you collect now, to show the experience of childbirth today in 50 years time?"

Learning department
is the variety of things I get to work on. When we were approached to help with the development of a new app aimed at our pre-school audience, I was really excited. I’m not particularly techy and I don’t know my RAM from my ROM but that didn’t matter – my role in the project was to make sure the app fitted in with the educational ethos of our children’s interactive galleries in the Museum.,The app was made in partnership with a digital agency called
GR/DD
. We knew we wanted the app to appeal to our pre-school audience so we looked to our most popular exhibits for this age group for inspiration. The water area in our
Garden gallery
is a firm favourite of our younger visitors and so it made sense to start there.,GR/DD came up with an idea for an app in which children could experiment with floating, sinking and mixing colours within a bath tub environment. We all loved the idea. For me, bath time as a child holds some really happy memories so I really hoped we could recreate that playful atmosphere with the app.,Choosing which objects to use in the app was a tricky process! They had to be instantly recognisable to children so that they could make the link between the object and how it behaves when it is put into water. During the development process I’d often show my team of
Explainers
the draft plans to see if they had any ideas or feedback based on their experience of working within the
Garden gallery
and it was really useful to get their input.,Early on in the process we all agreed that it was important to include a Parents’ Zone within the app. We wanted to provide some information for parents about how they could use the app to encourage the development of key scientific skills. In our interactive galleries we encourage learning through play and open questioning. For that reason, the Parents’ Zone includes hints and tips about open questions that parents can ask their children whilst they play the app or later on during real bath time.,After months of development we are all so pleased with the final
Splash! app
. I love how the water on screen moves and flows as the device is tilted and turned, and the sounds that the objects make when they drop into the water. I think the app perfectly captures the fun atmosphere I remember as a child.,It’s aimed at pre-school children but in my experience the adults enjoy playing just as much as the children. In fact, we should probably add a footnote onto the app description which says “for big kids too!”,If this post has whet your appetite to play on Splash! make sure you run the hot tap to the top of the bath to see what happens – it’s my favourite bit!,Discover more about Splash!

For me the release of
Mars Explorer Barbie
confirmed ‘Mars Mania’ is upon us. There are big questions surrounding the ethics and feasibility of sending humans to Mars, however proposals keep emerging which hope to do so, many of which are private enterprises.,One interesting example is the
Inspiration Mars Foundation
, which in 2018 plans to perform a Mars flyby, over a period of 501 days, with a married couple as its crew. Another,
Mars One
, seems to have really captured the public’s imagination.,It may sound like science fiction, but Mars One hopes to establish a colony on Mars by 2023. The plan is to use existing technologies, such as solar power and water recycling, to create a permanent habitat for the astronauts. Over the next ten years they will send rovers, satellites, living units, life support systems and supply units to Mars ready for the arrival of the first settlers in 2023.,Applications for the first round of astronauts closed recently; over 200,000 people, from more than 140 countries applied. Six teams of four will be selected for training, with further opportunities opening every year. The crew will learn medical procedures, how to grow food on Mars, and how to maintain the habitat and rovers. In 2024 a second crew will depart Earth, with four new settlers arriving every two years until 2033, when 20 people should be living on Mars.,This incredibly challenging mission is estimated to cost $6 billion. Interestingly part of the funding will come from a reality TV show which will follow the teams from their recruitment through to their first few years living on Mars. In addition to high costs the team will face Mars’ fiercely hostile environment; high levels of radiation, low gravity, little atmosphere, high impact from the solar winds, and water sources frozen underground. If successful the astronauts will make history, but it won’t be easy and they will never breathe fresh air again.,The mission throws up many interesting questions from both a personal and technological perspective.

However, one of the most seasoned figures in modern politics argued this week that science is not just a cultural activity but plays a central role in driving the nation’s economy.
Lord Heseltine
, the former deputy Prime Minister, delivered this message to a 300-strong audience attending the
Campaign for Science and Engineering
(CaSE)
Annual Lecture
.,Speaking in the Science Museum’s
IMAX theatre
, Lord Heseltine, who described the Museum as “very impressive”, called for science to help drive economic growth in the UK (the full speech can be read
here
) as well as discussing research, industrial strategy and the ability of technology to inspiring young people.,Drawing on the development of
IMAX technology
, which has seen decades of advances in technology to improve the public’s cinematic experience, Lord Heseltine noted that if just one student went “to school tomorrow with a renewed enthusiasm for their science lessons, then the pioneers of IMAX technology would surely have done a worthwhile job.”,Lord Heseltine last delivered the CaSE Annual Lecture in
1989
, when the organisation was called Save British Science, just a fortnight after the fall of the
Berlin Wall
. That event, and the political harmony that followed, drove economic collaboration across Europe, helping create today’s global economy.,How to keep up with other nations in the global economy is central to Lord Heseltine’s recently published report:
No stone unturned in pursuit of growth
. Lord Heseltine called for the government to “place educational improvement, the raising of basic standards and the complete intolerance of sink schools” at the heart of the growth agenda – a key theme of his report.,In his speech, Lord Heseltine was optimistic about the future of science education, noting that “science has never been so accessible or exciting,” and encouraging members of the audience to visit schools and meet students, “Every child remembers the brilliant adult who sparked a flame of ambition in their head, who changed the course of their life forever.”,Inspiring the next generation of scientists and engineer’s is a vital part of the Museum’s mission. Engaging with 400,000 school children a year, the Museum’s
Learning
team work with thousands of science teachers across the country to help them develop innovative tools and techniques to deliver outstanding science lessons.,The speech concluded with a look at industrial strategy, “It is about government working hand-in-hand with business to help our industrial base get ahead,” before a Q&A discussion with audience members. The Q&A touched on the benefits of blue skies research; with Lord Heseltine commenting that research must not only be done for its own sake, but also for the pursuit of growth.,Lord Heseltine’s comments here at the Museum come in the wake of a recent speech at the
Royal Society
by the Chancellor, who emphasised the central role of science in driving a modern, dynamic economy."

Laying a telegraph cable some 1,000 miles long from the UK to the US coast in the 1850s was certainly no easy feat, but it’s safe to say
this incredible act changed our world
and deserves its prime place in our ‘
Information Age
‘ gallery. Messages that would have taken 10 days to be delivered by ship, now took a matter of minutes and opened up a faster way of living, working and trading.,These days, cable systems rely on fibre optic rather than telegraphic technology and largely won the fight for communication over satellites due to their lower cost and high transfer speeds. But where satellites have the risk of flying space debris, the seabed comes with its own dangers… underwater avalanches. Thought to be caused largely by earthquakes, recent research reveals that underwater avalanches can transport ten times more sediment than all of the world’s rivers combined, and if our precious cables were to be in an avalanche’s path that’d likely be the end of our digital lifeline, along with important economic and defence information too.,“The biggest underwater avalanche on record is the Grand Banks earthquake (1929), off the coast of Canada. The avalanche broke every cable from the UK to the USA. What’s the risk now? It’s hard to predict. We have far more cables carrying more data than ever.,The global economy relies on uninterrupted usage of a network of telecoms cables on the seafloor. Losing cables would mean we’d lose bandwidth, lose access to financial markets, planes could be grounded for days because airlines can’t do security clearances. The risk is credible and real.”,Dr Mike Clare, National Oceanography Centre,With so much at stake and an ever more unstable climate surrounding us, research into this field is critical. That’s why we’re so excited to have the ‘smart boulder’ from MBARI currently on display in our ‘
Antenna
‘ gallery. It’s the first device created that’s able to withstand the violent forces exerted by underwater avalanches long enough to return useful data to scientists.,The ‘smart boulder’ is the result of an ongoing collaboration between US, Chinese and UK researchers. The boulder spends many months at the bottom of the sea recording data and sending information about where it is and how it’s moving when it gets caught in avalanches.,“The smart boulder is a game changer. For the first time we can understand both the density and the speed of the avalanche. No other equipment can survive at the bottom of the flow – where the most damage will be done to cables. We learn every time there’s an underwater avalanche, and we tell companies how to protect themselves.”,Dr Mike Clare, National Oceanography Centre,The Smart Boulder will be on display in our interactive

Beagle 2
European Space Agency (ESA) lander which, we now know, did make it successfully to the planet’s surface in 2003 but failed to call home; alongside, ironically, is the type of detector (also built in Britain) flown on the
Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter
of NASA that discovered the intact
Beagle 2
, very near to its landing target, a decade after contact had been lost.,The unluckiest Mars nation was the Soviet Union. Just two partial successes from over 20 launches. The first of the Russian Federation’s attempts also ended in failure when
Mars 96
failed to leave Earth, splashing and crashing its way across the Pacific and South America. One of the instruments it was carrying, also on show in the Science Museum, is Britain’s FONEMA, designed to probe the mysteries of Mars’ magnetic field.,Twenty years later and Russia is trying again, this time with today’s
Exomars Trace Gas Orbiter
mission launch – a collaboration between ESA and the Russian Federation’s national space agency Roscosmos. This spacecraft will orbit the planet, studying for traces of gases like methane (with instruments including Britain’s ozone-mapping ultraviolet spectrometer) that
might
be associated with biological activity, and release an experimental lander called
Schiaparelli
. Russia has provided the launching rocket (
Proton
) and three more of the scientific instruments.
Schiaparelli
will test landing techniques for the second part of the
Exomars
programme to be launched in 2018, also a Europe/Russia collaboration, when a roving vehicle – built in Britain – will be released to drive around the red planet’s surface.,Despite all the years of setbacks these latest missions will join a flotilla of spacecraft now orbiting above or trundling over the dusty plains and craters of Mars, scanning, probing, drilling and sampling. Slowly and surely we are learning so much more about our solar system neighbour, the planet that over centuries has pulled on our imaginations like no other.,There is, of course, an ultimate goal to strive for: landing a human on Mars and returning her of him safely to the Earth. And as President Kennedy said of such challenges back in 1962, we choose to do them, ‘not because they are easy but because they are hard.’ Getting humans to Mars and back will be for spaceflight what
Concorde
was to aviation – an equivalent expansion of effort and expense between the Wright Brothers’ pioneering flight in 1903 and the first supersonic passenger service over seventy years later. The ramping up of cost and capability in order to reach Mars will be orders of magnitude more than that required to get Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on to the Moon’s surface in Apollo 11 and safely back home.,So will it
ever
happen? Visitors to the Science Museum’s recent
Cosmonauts
exhibition departed the display through a room bathed in blue with a red breach in the ceiling. Gazing up from its crystalline pod an android-like form, with the image of Yuri Gagarin – first human in space, offered no clear answer. It had been flown around the Moon in the
Zond 7
spacecraft by the Soviet Union in 1969 – too hazardous a mission for a human to undertake, it had been decided at the time. Going to Mars will be very dangerous. We look to it in the night sky and think what it is like to be there, but send only robotic emissaries. Will
Exomars
encourage us to visit Mars in person or will it demonstrate once again how much easier it is to rely on robots. Well, we got to the Moon because it was hard to do."

Financial Times
explores the objects in the Science Museum that have shaped our economy.,The world economy can be bewildering. All too often it’s a system that we discuss using abstract terms such as “fiscal” or “gross domestic product”. But of course this apparently-abstract thing we call “the economy” has profound consequences for the way we live. With seven billion people making countless choices every day, buying and selling around ten billion distinct types of product or service, the economy defies our understanding. Ripples in the system can make fortunes, cause environmental devastation, lift people out of grinding poverty, or throw them into joblessness.,One of the joys of writing the book and
BBC radio
series
Fifty Things That Made the Modern Economy
has been getting specific – picking an idea or an everyday object and telling the story of how it shaped our economy. Did you know that the first writing was developed by accountants? Or that the Romans were big fans of concrete? Or that the Houses of Parliament burned to the ground when some hapless civil servants decided to dispose of obsolete financial records by setting fire to them?,But a visit to the Science Museum takes the story still further, because some of the leading actors in this story are on display. Here are five of my favourites.,Google search:
There’s a
server
– a computer that responds to online requests – from the early days of Google. It’s amazing that this company, barely two decades old, has become a gatekeeper to vast swathes of the online economy. Many businesses succeed or fail based on whether the
Google search algorithm
thinks they’re the best answer to a question typed into the search bar.,iPhone:
Staying with the world of computing, you can admire an
iPhone
– assuming you don’t already have one in your pocket – and compare it to other phones and computers. The history of the iPhone is a fascinating one: it’s a triumph for the entrepreneur Steve Jobs at Apple. But it’s also a wonderful advertisement for the
power of government research
, since many of the key features of the phone – from web access to a touch-screen to the location-detecting GPS system – were originally developed by governments, often the US military.,The Pill:
There’s more to technology than computing, of course. Wander over to the
Who Am I?
Gallery
and look at the
contraceptive pill
; the pill is often identified as a socially revolutionary invention, but economists believed it unleashed an
economic revolution
, too. By giving women more reliable and discrete control over their fertility, the pill encouraged young women in the 1970s to postpone marriage and children, and move into long professional training courses, becoming doctors, dentists, and lawyers.,Paper:
I have a soft spot for the under- rated inventions. Everybody likes to talk about the significance of the Gutenberg printing press – but the printing press would have been pointless without a cheap writing material. That material was
paper.
When Europe belatedly embraced paper – long after China and the Arab world – it became arguably the continent’s first heavy industry, in the 13th century. Only then did the printing press make sense. And our hunger for paper continued, with the Fourdrinier Machine of the late 19th century a major step forward in paper production.,Robots
: Finally, the technology everyone is talking about at the moment:
robots
. Will they take all our jobs? Perhaps: but the employment rate in the UK has never been higher than it is today, in mid – 2017. There are 100 robots to admire in the museum’s special
robot exhibition
: go and meet them, and see if you can make sense of the mystery of a robot economy in which so many humans are still working so hard."

While the offensive would ultimately fail some of the medical developments used to save the lives of those involved continue to be used in war zones today.,A simple blue crayon line on a map marks the road from the medical HQ of the 76

Field Ambulance all the way to Messines Ridge. The high ground of the ridge was the target of a major Allied operation as a preliminary to the Passchendaele offensive. You can see the map on display in
Wounded
, currently in the Mezzanine gallery at the Science Museum, and as you follow the blue line, you can see how it is intersected more densely as the front approaches. There is the trench network itself, a small gauge railway line leading to a casualty clearing station, and newly dug straighter tracks (marked in green) so that stretchers laden with their casualties could be carried easily and quickly away from the battlefield without having to turn too many corners.,The attack on Messines Ridge marked a new phase in the Great War. In addition to the weeks of bombardment before 7 June, nine divisions of men were ready to be hurled at the enemy, nineteen deep gallery tunnels had been dug under the ridge leading to mine chambers packed with a million pounds of explosives. They were detonated just before dawn, in the largest man-made explosion to that date on our planet, its sound carrying from Ypres to London on the wind.,When the dust settled, the ridge had almost disappeared. Allied forces moved forward to occupy the once-dominant German positions and scored one of the few unequivocal victories of the war. But from then on, through the summer and into the late autumn, the offensives slowed, bogged down in dreadful weather and appalling mud. Eventually there would be utter failure and no meaningful gains, in the end 70,000 British soldiers were killed and another 170,000 wounded.,The map in the Wounded exhibition was drawn by a Regimental Medical Officer (RMO) in preparation for the attack on Messines Ridge, and would have been one of a number distributed to his stretcher bearer team leaders. This one is in perfect condition, the colours from the crayons used to mark the routes from the front to the rear are clearly distinguishable a century after its creation, so it must have been kept as a copy, in a personal or Field Ambulance record. At first glance, the map appears to be a tangle of lines but look more closely and we see careful preparation by a medical service well-used to attritional warfare: many medical relay posts set up and stocked with their supplies of dressings and morphia, multiple options for bearers running back with their patient on their stretcher, then going out again, picking up what they needed, or finding another relay post if where one had been destroyed or the pathways to it wrecked. It’s a very precise document because men’s lives literally depended on the RMO’s cartographical skills and his bearers’ ability to interpret them.,Opposite the map in its case is an entirely different object but one every bit as important to the medical effort for the Passchendaele casualties: Oswald Hope Robertson’s blood transfusion kit in its portable wooden case. The techniques of blood transfusions were still in development during the war and Robertson had been one of the very first to perform them in 1915. He had worked all over the Western Front installing transfusion and blood storage facilities, and training medics in their use.,His work at Passchendaele in its dying days was recorded in his diary the horror that he understood only too well:,“Haemorrhage, haemorrhage, haemorrhage – blood everywhere – clothes soaked in blood, pools of blood in the stretchers, streams of blood dropping from the stretchers to the floor. I was in blood up to my elbows and my rubber apron was one solid red smear.  All we could do was to stop the bleeding and get the patients as comfortable as possible.”,Robertson and his colleagues picked up their patients where the stretcher bearers delivered them as instructed by their medical maps. In one 24 hour period, the field hospital where he worked admitted 1800 patients, there were simply too many for him to do transfusions for all of them, but he did his best to control their bleeding however he could.,At Passchendaele, both medics and bearers must have felt as if no matter what they did, the deluge of the wounded and dying wound never stop.  But they all worked on, and in doing so, transformed the prospects of military casualties then and ever since.,,There is a final detail on the map – almost unnoticeable unless you are looking for it – the name of the headquarters of the field ambulance: Kandahar Farm. The post was named for a previous posting by a battalion reassigned to Passchendaele: Kandahar in Afghanistan.  There are still British troops in Kandahar, part of the much smaller force left behind after the end of Operation HERRICK in 2014. During that conflict, medics learned again about blood, and its horrors. You can see the equipment they used in a case at the very end of the exhibition – the end of a road begun on a small map, drawn in coloured crayon, by medics determined to save lives, and keep them saved, no matter what the journey.,Dr Emily Mayhew is a military medical historian. She has written two books:  “Wounded: the Long Journey Home from the Great War” and “A Heavy Reckoning: War, Medicine and Survival in Afghanistan and Beyond.” Both are available from the Science Museum shop.,Our sister museum, the National Railway Museum in York, has also been exploring medical care in the First World War in their exhibition

In October last year we opened our new interactive gallery, Wonderlab: The Statoil Gallery, followed in December by
Mathematics: The Winton Gallery
. We’re also currently reinventing our
Medicine galleries
which are due to open in 2019. With all these changes taking place, what happens to the objects once old galleries close in order to make way for new? David Rooney, Keeper of Technologies and Engineering, looks at the new lease of life some of our shipping models got following the closure of the Shipping Gallery in 2012 to make way for
Information Age
.,,On 10 July 1963, journalists crowded into the third floor of the Science Museum’s newest building to see the opening of the Aeronautics Gallery, hot on the heels of the Sailing Ships Gallery on the floor below revealed five months previously.,After an earlier preview of the galleries, the
Sunday Times
exclaimed that ‘a war against boredom is being waged at the Science Museum … instead of row upon row of glass cases, planes are suspended in mock flight from the roof of a hangar … and ships and boats are displayed in the form of real ocean-going liners.’,The Aeronautics Gallery still exists today as
Flight
, having been updated in the 1990s. But our Sailing Ships Gallery closed in 2012 to make way for our critically acclaimed permanent display,
Information Age
.,The model ships and boats that captivated our 1960s visitors (and journalists) were moved to our off-site stores in specially constructed protective crates. These buffered the delicate artefacts from rapid changes in temperature and humidity which might have caused damage during the move. They’re now stable again but we leave the plastic covers in place until somebody asks to see any particular object.,When photographers Anderson & Low came to see the models last year, though, they had a different idea, and the results of their visits are now displayed in our exhibition,
Voyages
. Photographed through the protective covers, and with only the ambient light of the store rooms, the models have taken on remarkable and magical new forms.,These photographs are not just beautiful, they are revelatory. They show us very clearly that by looking differently, we see new things. We explore; we go on voyages of discovery. And these new viewpoints on the maritime world keep our collections alive, even after they have moved off display.,See the stunning images for yourself at

Sir Isaac Newton
. Although he lived around 300 years ago, the influence of his brilliant ideas still pervade many of our interactive exhibits and, if asked to name a famous scientist, his name is never far from people’s lips. A true giant of maths and physics, it wasn’t until
Einstein
that scientists found a different set of shoulders to stand on in order to see further.,Much could be said about his work in optics (he named the spectrum, for example) or his work in aiding the entry of pets into the home (supposedly, he invented the cat flap), but it is his work into classical mechanics that we constantly refer to in Launchpad, i.e. how stuff moves.,The Water Rocket is a perfect example of his laws of motion. In this hourly demonstration, a mixture of air and water is pumped into a plastic bottle, leading to an increase in pressure inside the bottle, so that, when the launch button is pressed, the “rocket” speeds down a track at up to forty miles an hour.,https://vine.co/v/OJVTYzj5QPg,It is Newton’s third law of motion that is most obviously in evidence here: Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. When the air and water fly out of the end of the bottle with a certain force, this pushes the rocket in the opposite direction with an equal force.,Newton’s second law (The force moving an object is equal to its mass multiplied by its acceleration, or F=ma) sneaks in too, as the fact that the bottle is lighter than the ejected air and water means that it undergoes a greater acceleration from the same force, and so it flies further and faster down the track.,All of these laws, as well as many other scientific ideas, were written down by Newton in his impressively named book,
Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica
. This book (understandably often shortened to simply Principia) was written entirely in Latin, as was the style at the time, and was published in 1687. And there is a copy in the Science Museum, in the
Cosmos & Culture
gallery.,It is difficult to appreciate how important this book was to the world of science. As well as being ground breaking to physics, it also introduced the world to mathematics involving calculus. Rarely has a book been packed with so much!,Although there are controversies surrounding Newton and his work, particularly regarding his treatment of contemporary scientists Hooke and Leibniz, there can be little doubt that the impact he had on physics deserves recognition. So go and see the book in which the principles were all written down and then go to Launchpad and see this exciting physics in action.,Ben is an Explainer at the Science Museum.,If you are a teacher planning a visit to Launchpad with your students, you can find out more information

Learning team
looks at some mischievous mirrors in the Science Museum.,Mirror, mirror on the wall, who’s the fairest of them all? We all know this famous saying from Snow White, but mirrors are incredibly useful in our day to day lives. We use them in the morning to check our hair, in cars to avoid crashes and some buildings have them in corridors for safety. But there are some other, more mischievous, ways to use them. For example, our Grab the Bling exhibit in Launchpad uses a huge spherical concave mirror (one that bulges inwards) to trick people into thinking they can touch a desirable watch.,In fact, the concave mirror produces something called an inverted real image of the watch. This means that the image of the watch is upside down compared to the real watch and is made by beams of light meeting at a single point in front of the mirror. People would then think that the image is the actual watch and try to snatch it, when in fact our watch is perfectly safe underneath.,Mirrors are also used in our Seeing Through Walls exhibit which I like to use to pretend that I’m Superman.,Looking at the shape of the tubes, it’s clear that light can’t go up or through the wall and so it must go down. The two tubes are connected by a pipe in the raised area of the floor,Four mirrors are carefully placed where the tubes change direction so that the light can be directed around the tube and you and your buddy can see each other!,The
Science in the 18
th
Century
gallery next door to Launchpad has many interesting devices that use mirrors to work. This gallery is pretty awesome because it’s filled with equipment used by King George III and his science tutor, Stephen Demainbray, to learn about science. Basically, it’s a 250 year old version of Launchpad! One of the equipments in this gallery that uses mirrors to trick people is a polemoscope, or “jealousy glass”.,They were used by opera goers to look at other people in the audience in private. They look very similar to opera glasses which were used to see the actors on stage more clearly, but instead a mirror inside is slanted at 45° so that the user can see what’s going on to one side of them. This makes the polemoscope ideal to secretly spy on people!,So there you have it, it seems that mirrors aren’t only used to see who’s fairest of them all, but also who’s the cheekiest!"

).,Launched by the European Patent Office in Munich just over a decade ago, the awards honour innovators, both individuals and teams, whose creativity and pioneering inventions have helped to provide the answers to some of the biggest challenges today.,As one of the
international jury
it was far from easy to weigh up the impact on innovation, society, economic prosperity and job creation of the initial crop of around 400 proposals put forward by the public, patent examiners and patent offices – such as the UK’s
Intellectual Property Office
. After a day of discussions in Munich we came up with the following shortlist of 15 entries from a dozen countries – Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Morocco, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK and the United States.,Industry
Lars Liljeryd (Sweden), for digital audio compression, a technology that has helped drive the market for streaming, storing and playing audio files by making it possible to shrink the file size by up to half without sacrificing audio quality.,Giuseppe Remuzzi, Ariela Benigni, Carlamaria Zoja (Italy), for devising drug regimes that provide an alternative to dialysis for chronic kidney disease.,Jan van den Boogaart and Oliver Hayden (Netherlands/Austria), who developed the world’s first automated, computer-based blood test for malaria, using a combination of 30 blood parameters to create a tell-tale “data fingerprint”.,,Small and medium-sized enterprises,Gert-Jan Gruter (Netherlands), for inventing a new manufacturing method using plant starches to produce recyclable plastic bottles – for the first time making such bioplastics economically viable on a commercial scale.,Günter Hufschmid (Germany) created a super-sponge for oil spills, consisting of a novel wax able to adsorb close to seven times its own weight in hydrophobic liquids.,Steve Lindsey (UK), came up with an energy-saving rotary air compressor, marking an advance in the field of air compression that has seen relatively little innovation since the development of the piston compressor in the 1930s.,,Research
Hans Clevers (Netherlands), for growing lab grown human organs, or ‘organoids’ to test the specific effects of drugs safely.,Laurent Lestarquit, José Ángel Ávila Rodríguez and team (France, Spain, Germany and Belgium), who developed signalling technologies to ensure that Europe’s Galileo global navigation satellite system provides high positioning accuracy, within a few centimetres.,Sylviane Muller (France), who has devised a way to treat lupus by targeting immune cells known as T-cells, which she identified as the main trigger for the disease.,,Non-EPO countries
James G. Fujimoto, Eric A. Swanson and Robert Huber (USA/Germany), for advances in optical coherence tomography which can study body tissue and blood vessels without invasive probing or surgical biopsies.,Waleed Hassanein (USA), for a means to sustain transplant organs known as the Organ Care System, which extends the duration in which donated organs can be transported and transplanted by replicating human body-like conditions.,Adnane Remmal (Morocco), who has increased the efficacy of antibiotics used to treat bacterial infections by using the medicinal properties of local plants.,,Lifetime achievement
Elmar Mock (Switzerland), co-inventor of the world’s best-selling timepiece, the Swatch, for which he developed an ultrasonic plastic welding technique that not only helped streamline its production but also formed the basis of offshoot applications including “welding” wood, concrete and even human bone.,Rino Rappuoli (Italy), who pioneered so-called “conjugate vaccines” and “reverse vaccinology” to help launch a new generation of immunisations that have been administered to hundreds of millions worldwide.,Axel Ullrich (Germany), for developing a new generation of drugs, including breast-cancer drug Herceptin and “tumour starving” Sunitinib, that stop cancer by disrupting cellular communication processes.,,The winners, including the results of the public vote, will be unveiled at the 2017 award ceremony, which will take place at the Arsenale in Venice on 15 June.,Benoît Battistelli, President of the European Patent Office, said the aim of the awards is to “honour the men and women who contribute to improving our daily lives. They are among the leading minds of science and research.”,“These innovations, that have improved and even saved the lives of millions, rely upon robust intellectual property protection and for the last forty years the EPO has been supporting inventors with the highest quality patents.”"

Agriculture Gallery
was once a radical new visitor experience. Unveiled back in 1951, its detailed dioramas and hugely important prototypes of the latest machinery would have caused the same excitement as our new galleries do today.,Sixty five years ago William O’Dea, the gallery’s original curator, wanted to showcase the ‘immense strides… made in mechanization during and just after the war’.  With rationing still in place, it’s not hard to see why people would be keen to see how new technologies were helping to dramatically increase food production in the UK  – and putting an end to the back-breaking labour of the old ways.,This month (January 2017), the Museum’s pioneering Agriculture Gallery closed to make way for a stunning new suite of
Medicine Galleries
(opening in 2019). Meanwhile, behind the scenes, a new team of Science Museum curators are carrying out research for a contemporary agriculture gallery that will examine the challenges facing global food production today.,BBC presenter Tom Heap came to the Museum to celebrate the original gallery, which was one of the first to use dioramas on a major scale, vividly presenting the latest agricultural machinery at work in traditional farm settings.,David Matless, Professor of Cultural Geography at the University of Nottingham, is interested in what the old gallery tells us about how we used to live:,“These dioramas represent time capsules of mid-20
th
century environmental attitudes… The old gallery was a celebration of farming and its productivity… although now to us it looks very much like something from the past”.,Horses were still common on farms in 1951, so the tractors and combine harvesters on display represented the radically ambitious future.,Today’s farmers still rely on science and technology for new ways to farm the land and they are producing more food per person than ever before. But now we also want to preserve biodiversity, ecosystems and natural resources, reduce our impact on the environment, and ensure that future generations can produce food too.,The new agriculture gallery will show how farmers are working with scientists and engineers in the 21
st
century to achieve this balance – feeding over 7 billion people every day, and managing our growing social and environmental concerns.,With the
Science Museum Group’s collection
of more than seven million objects, new acquisitions from modern farms, as wells as prototypes and models from cutting-edge researchers, the new gallery will look to the past, present and future to tell the story of agriculture.,We are working hard to make sure it will delight our visitors every bit as much as its predecessor.,Written by Mary Cavanagh, Senior Content Developer for the Contemporary Agriculture gallery and Julia Murray, PR Manager."

RoboThespian
, developed by Engineered Arts, who implored the throng of 500 VIPs to ‘strike the palms of one’s hands together, and repeatedly, for that neuron-activating performance.’,,Among those present at the reception were Deborah Bull, King’s College London; Claire Moriarty, Defra; Jack Kreindler of Sentrian; David Rossington of DCMS; Stuart Hobley and David Heathcoat-Amory of the Heritage Lottery Fund; John Owen of Fidelity UK; Stephen Deuchar, Art Fund; actor Toby Jones; TV presenter Dallas Campbell; Mike Muller, ARM Holdings; Alex Papadakis, Papadakis publisher; Dea Birkett,  Kids in Museums; Gillian Reynolds of the Telegraph; John Elkington of Volans Ventures; Oliver Morton, Economist; Will Jackson, Engineered Arts; Profs Jon Agar and Arthur Miller of UCL; Rob McCargow of PwC; Paul Hardaker, Institute of Physics; Stephen Breslin, Glasgow Science Centre; Claire Mackintosh of The Orr Mackintosh Foundation; Martin Roth, Director, V&A; Andrew Cohen,  BBC; Lucy Rogers, RobotWars; Becky Parker, Simon Langton Grammar School for Boys; Anthony Geffen of Atlantic Productions; Katherine Courtney of the UK Space Agency; Alan Brown, Wellcome Trust; Judy Wajcman of LSE; Ulrich Kernbach, Deutches Museum;  Sir Mark Walport, Government Chief Scientist; and Trustees Fiona Woolf, Anton Valk, Sharon Flood, Simon Linnett and Lopa Patel .,The exhibition tells how the story of robots dates back to the emergence of a mechanical view of the heavens, many centuries before the word “robot” (Czech for “serf”) was first coined in the 1920 science fiction play Rossumovi Univerzální Roboti (Rossum’s Universal Robots) by the Czech Karel Capek, in which a robot rebellion extinguishes the human race.,Visitors enter by walking past a wall of artificial skulls with robotic eyes, an interactive artwork named Area V5 after the part of the human brain which perceives motion by its developer, Louis-Philippe Demers of Nanyang Technical University, Singapore.,In the exhibition they are first confronted with an animatronic baby, under whose latex skin three dozen metal joints whir. Ben Russell, lead curator, said: ‘Coming face to face with a mechanical human has always been a disconcerting experience. That sense of unease, of something you cannot quite put your finger on, goes to the heart of our long relationship with robots.’,The rise of the mechanical cosmos is represented by several objects, including the oldest astronomical instrument originating in western Europe, an astrolabe made in France in about 1300. This view of the heavens as clockwork, along with a surge of anatomical insights, provoked discussion of the human body as a machine, paving the way for the earliest robots.,Among the first objects is a mechanical crucifixion sculpture constructed in Brittany in about 1700, which would have wept drops of wooden blood while the Virgin Mary stretched out her wooden hands.,Another expression of mechanised faith, an automaton monk – built in around 1560 and one of only three in the world –  is on loan from the Smithsonian. Attributed to Gianello Toledo, in Spain, the clockwork figure can walk, move its lips, raise a crucifix and rosary, and beat its breast.,Ian Blatchford singled out some of the more spectacular automata, the
Silver Swan
lent by the Bowes Museum in County Durham. When Mark Twain saw the swan in 1867 he wrote that it had “a living grace about his movement and a living intelligence in his eyes”. Devised by Belgian horologist John-Joseph Merlin in 1773, the swan will be on display until 23 March.,Blatchford added that the newly reconstructed ‘rose engine’ automaton lathe (German, 1750-1888) was ‘two and a half metres of pure bling that would look at home in President Trump’s drawing room.’,During the next phase of the rise of the robots covered by the exhibition, automated looms and spinning machines would come to replace skilled craftsmen. In Lyon in 1744, Jacques de Vaucanson caused a riot by introducing an automatic loom powered by a donkey.,Maria, the first Hollywood blockbuster humanoid, seen in Fritz Lang’s 1927 film, Metropolis, raised yet more troubling questions about the place of humans in a world of machines. Also present in the exhibition is the ultimate dystopian robot, the T-800 used in Terminator Salvation.,Visitors can come face-to-face with Eric, a modern recreation of the UK’s first robot rebuilt as a result of a
Kickstarter campaign
, as well as Italy’s Cygan, a 1950s entertainment robot which once danced and performed in shows.,The challenges faced by machines attempting to mimic human abilities, such as walking, is also explored, with the intricate mechanisms of the Bipedal Walker – rescued by curator Ben Russell from a forgotten cupboard – and Honda’s P2, two of the first robots to walk like humans.,In an array of Perspex boxes in the penultimate section, visitors can watch the two-armed Swiss robot YuMi  make and throw paper airplanes and also interact with several robots: Inhka, a former receptionist at King’s College London, answers questions and offers fashion tips with attitude; Zeno R25 replicates facial expressions;  Rob’s Open Source Android (ROSA)  tracks visitors; and Pepper invites humans to touch its hands and fist bump.,The android Kodomoroid, the most life-like of its time, reads robot-related news bulletins three times every hour; RoboThespian gives theatrical performances; and Nao, the  most ubiquitous humanoid robot, stands  (unless ‘tired’, when it sits) to tell a story exploring how robots make decisions.,Later this year Robots will go on tour, visiting the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester to launch the 2017
Manchester Science Festival
, the Life Science Centre in Newcastle (2018) and the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh (2019), then tour internationally until 2021.,Chair of the Science Museum Group Board of Trustees, Dame Mary Archer told the VIP reception how the Heritage Lottery Fund had “enabled us to create a new robotics collection for the nation and also digitise that collection’.,She thanked the exhibition’s media partner, the Guardian, and also the Engineering and Physical Science Research Council; Federal Department of Foreign Affairs Switzerland; The Daiwa Anglo-Japanese Foundation; The Great Britain Sasakawa Foundation and The Mercers’ Company for helping make the exhibition possible. ‘,Ian Blatchford also contributed his thanks. “We would especially like to thank Rob Knight, Prof Owen Holland, Prof Cynthia Breazeal, Prof Simon Schaffer, Prof Vanessa Toulmin and Prof Alan Winfield. “,‘Countless organisations from across the world agreed to lend us their incredible mechanical creations, making this exhibition possible,’ he added. ‘ We would particularly like to thank Dr Shoichiro Toyoda and Toyota, Honda, Softbank, Miraikan, The Italian Institute of Technology and the Shadow Robot Company here in London. ‘,And he made ‘a special mention’ of the Bowes Museum in County Durham ‘for lending us their exquisitely beautiful Silver Swan.’,The exhibition was also visited today by Edwina Dunn of dunnhumby, Nell Merlino, who created Take Our Daughters to Work Day, and Christiane Amanpour , Chief International Correspondent for CNN, representing

– came at the culmination of a London visit by Gates in which he, Sir Richard Branson, and Secretary of State for International Development,
Priti Patel
, joined over 1,000 leading scientists to celebrate the $1 billion Grand Challenges programme of the
Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
that seeks solutions to the most vexing problems in health and development.,Introduced by Science Museum director, Ian Blatchford, the

took place in front of a packed audience which included well-known figures such as Martha Lane Fox, Prof Jim Al-Khalili, Sir Harpal Kumar, Dame Mary Archer, politicians such as Amanda Solloway, MP, and Lord Willetts, and journalists, broadcasters and bloggers including Dallas Campbell, Ed Yong and GrrlScientist.,After an introduction by
Helena Nordenstedt
of the Karolinska Institute, Sweden, and statistics populariser
Gapminder
, in which she summed up global health in a single graph, Gates and will.i.am ranged over many subjects, from the extraordinary fertility of British science to the spectre of racist artificial intelligence, AI, in a Q and A with Evening Standard Editor, Sarah Sands.,It was fitting that, given the extraordinary diversity of the Museum’s vast collection of innovative firsts and its £24 million plans for
Medicine Galleries
, the most ambitious in the world, Gates
praised Britain
–  singling out the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine – for its “extraordinary leadership in science and innovation, which has been good for Britain and good for the world.”,When glimpsing into the future, Gates said the impact of science and technology is accelerating. Of all the coming developments, he expected the most impact to come from AI which just in the last few weeks showed it was better able to understand human speech than people. Fifty years from now there will be less need for human labour, so working hours could be reduced.,When gazing into his crystal ball, will.i.am predicted a new kind of poverty in the future, depending on how well artificial intelligence can curate information for a given person. ‘One day soon we will have our own personal AI” and depending on what AI they can afford, they will be information rich or information poor.,The education evangelist,
who has worked with the Museum and the Prince’s Trust to reach out to disadvantaged children
, said it was important to urge children to get into computer science, engineering or robotics.,He regards Bill Gates
as a hero
– a potential US President – and yearns for the day when children aspire to be scientists, engineers and innovators as much as singers. “Folks want to be like will.i.am in the inner city, not bill.i.am. We have to change popular culture, tech culture and politics to inspire these kids”.,Another reason is that racism is endemic, ‘in our system’ along with gender bias and could find its way into artificial intelligence without better education for all.,The Museum is working on a blockbuster
Robots
exhibition, which opens next February, and Gates said that he was optimistic future robots will help solve problems and will be subject to our control.,Despite more apocalyptic scenarios involving robot takeovers, he added that ‘it won’t be worse than nuclear weapons.’ He added the planet ‘will be fine…it is the human race that has to be careful.’,Afterwards Baroness Martha Lane Fox commented that for her the
quote of the evening
came from will.i.am, who said “the Internet can’t just be large companies, it has to be for everyone” which chimed with her

It was suitable for adults and children, balancing facts with fun. The humour and light-hearted moments were interspersed with information on more serious issues, giving everyone some food for thought upon leaving the theatre.,,The film features fascinating (and often bizarre) creatures from the world’s oceans. Narrated by Jim Carrey, this film brings you closer to the oft-ignored world of marine biology, with simple but intriguing insights into how the organisms in our oceans survive and thrive. The film itself is 45 minutes long, but passes quickly with amazing visuals, capturing in detail the different habitats in the ocean, from the opening scenes of Carbon Dioxide gas vents, to the coral reefs of Australia. The huge screen (one of the biggest in the world), along with the 3D effect, creates a feeling that you’re actually in the ocean, rather than watching it from the outside.,The film is easy to understand for everyone, but manages to touch on the most important and complicated areas of marine biology, for example the importance of the world’s mangroves forests and the issue of ocean acidification. Without going into much depth on the topic (no pun intended), Carrey speaks about some of the issues facing our oceans and the organisms living in them today, adding a more serious message to the otherwise light-hearted film. Ocean acidification and coral bleaching are mentioned, but only the very basics are covered – those interested in the topic will have to do further research outside the theatre.,Highlights of the film include the bizarre and fascinating mating habits of cuttlefish. For those who haven’t heard of the cuttlefish, its name is a bit of a misnomer. Cuttlefish are more closely related to snails than to fish, and are also a close relative of squids and nautiluses (two other sea-creatures mentioned in the film), and octopods. To avoid detection and attacks from larger males, smaller male giant cuttlefish disguise themselves as females, changing colour to match the females and hiding their extra appendage that the females lack. By doing this they can sneak past the larger males guarding the females. At this point they change the colour of the side of the body facing the female to the colouration of the males, all the while resembling a female on the other side of the body to fool the larger male. These ‘sneaks’ have remarkable mating success with the females, showing that size isn’t everything!,,The aforementioned cuttlefish, as well as corals and thousands of other species will be affected by ocean acidification, as we pump more CO2 into the atmosphere. The sea is very good at absorbing CO2, so as we increase the concentration in the atmosphere, the sea absorbs more and more. Although the chemistry of this is complicated, the result is simple: the pH drops (i.e. the water becomes more acidic) and calcifying organisms such as corals and cuttlefish could start dissolving over time. Atmospheric CO2 is currently 30% higher than at any time in the last 650,000 years, but ocean acidification and its effects on organisms is still poorly understood. However, in recent years, ocean acidification has received increasing levels of attention as an intrinsic player in climate change, allowing more funding for research into how it will affect marine organisms in the future. By increasing awareness through educational films such as ‘Under the Sea’, the youngest members of our population can grow up aware of the problems facing our oceans today and in the future.,Flora Beverley is doing work experience at the Science Museum.

The more we investigate this new way of learning about people, the more we are amazed at its potential.,Tracking devices have forced their way in our lives in recent years. Technologies like cameras, GPS and telecommunications have become cheap and easy to produce, opening the doorway to having more and more of our lives recorded, with everything about us being quantifiable. The steps we take in a day, where we go, how long we spend on the bus to get to work, how many calories we consume, how many times we text our friends in the day, what we enjoy reading… So much can be counted and recorded that some people have even made it their full-time obsession in what is called the ‘quantified self’ movement.,Some individuals, like

By examining our lives in numbers and patterns, we can design computer programs that seek out and mimic those patterns, even going so far as to copy how we interact with one another.,The ability to look at language as codes and patterns shocked students at the Georgia Institute of Technology in May 2016, when they found out that the teacher’s assistant that they had been emailing back and forth was actually a computer program. It was able to create realistic communication by examining 40 thousand correspondences with students, identifying patterns of language and information and feeding it back to the students. This wasn’t limited to questions about coursework, either: the artificial intelligence also participated in group discussions online, leaving none the wiser.,It is acceptable to dismiss this example of machine learning as being applicable to academics, but surely there are some fields, like creativity, that are stumped by computers… right?,In April 2016, a collaboration of art historians and data scientists completed

How to mend a broken heart)

Evelina London children’s hospital
. David gave me a fascinating insight into his work, including how 3D printed models of patient’s hearts can help surgeons.,What drew you to heart surgery?,When the procedure is finished you usually know immediately if it’s worked or not. It’s an instant thrill for me to see a successful operation. As a person I am not someone who likes to wait and see, preferring quick solutions. That instant gratification may be why I pursued heart surgery over other surgical disciplines.,It’s humbling. The heart is so fantastically designed; it can beat continuously for 100 years or more, non-stop. After an operation the heart has to immediately start working at full capacity. There’s no time for it to rest and recover from the injury of cutting and stitches that surgery inflicts. The patient immediately needs it to work perfectly, and it can.,Why did you choose to specialise in children?,Working with children who have congenital heart conditions is a wonderful intellectual as well as technical challenge. There are so many ways the heart can be abnormal and need correcting. It’s a very interesting challenge to firstly understand the abnormality and then work out how to cut and stitch a child’s heart to make it work normally.,What happens when a heart defect is detected in a baby?,Lots of heart problems are now picked up before a baby is born and parents are prepared. But when it’s not, the parents go from that peak of joy, with friends and family excitedly congratulating them, to the bottom falling out of their world when a heart condition is detected in the baby. The new family is left feeling utterly devastated as the baby is blue-lighted through the night to a specialist centre. It’s the greatest privilege to be able to help them.,What’s the most dramatic change you’ve seen in heart surgery?,When I started as a heart surgeon in 1984 you were never sure what you’d find when you started to operate on a patient. Now we can 3D print a model of a patient’s heart beforehand. Surprises during the operation are more or less eliminated.,How does 3D printing helping surgery?,3D printing a heart beforehand means I have time to get the concept of the patient’s blood-filled and pumping heart in my head. That way I can imagine it better when I’m actually performing the surgery.,A major challenge with heart surgery is that when we stop and drain the blood from the heart it collapses like a deflated balloon. It’s very like dressmaking. You alter the dress on the flat with the sewing machine, but all the time having to think how it will actually look when it’s 3D and being worn.,,How to mend a broken heart

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/leonardos-great-monuments-of-the-human-mind/,Roger Highfield,Leonardo’s great monuments of the human mind,Roger Highfield reflects on the opening of a new exhibition,Exhibitions and Galleries,,"The ‘extraordinary achievements’ of Leonardo da Vinci can be regarded as ‘great monuments of the human mind’, according to
Martin Kemp
, distinguished Emeritus Research Professor in the History of Art at Oxford University, at the launch yesterday of the Science Museum’s latest exhibition.,Kemp has spent a lifetime meditating on imagery in art and science from the Renaissance to the present day, writing books and curating art exhibitions on the great polymath. Despite the many legends that surround Leonardo, Kemp said that “the reality beneath the stories is no less exciting, as the Science Museum’s new exhibition Leonardo da Vinci: The Mechanics of Genius
makes abundantly clear
”.,Last night the formal opening of the exhibition was attended by around 400 people, including Paul Kahn, UK President, Airbus Group; Professor Sir Christopher Frayling, British educationalist and writer; Carole Souter, Chief Executive of the Heritage Lottery Fund; Sir Peter Bazalgette, Chair of Arts Council England; Sir Vernon Ellis, Chairman of the British Council; Anthony Geffen, CEO of Atlantic Productions; Professor Frank James of the Royal Institution; and Dame Mary Archer, Chair of the museum’s Board of Trustees.,Although it is
harder to categorise Leonardo’s genius than many realise
, it took centuries for his engineering skills to be as widely appreciated as his artistic skills. Leonardo’s thought processes lay hidden after his death in 1519, aged 67, when his manuscripts and collections were inherited by his apprentice and friend, Francesco Melzi.,On the instructions of Leonardo, Melzi had produced a
Treatise on Painting
which was published in 1651 and thought to be authoritative until the 19th century, when scholars realized it did not capture many of the insights held in his notes. Kemp described how these drawings show how Leonardo ‘visualised machines with a brilliance that no one else had ever done, and drew them with a presence and potency that no one else had ever done”.,These ‘thrilling’ works show how, more than his contemporaries, Leonardo was capable of creating what Kemp called ‘mental sculpture,’ visualising motions in different planes, as moving three dimensional objects. ‘No one quite drew machines quite like Leonardo did.’,Leonardo devised graphical techniques to show the components – ‘elementi’ – of machines, such as screws, gears and springs, and how they worked together in kinetic sculptures. In particular, his Madrid Codices manuscripts, discovered in the Biblioteca Nacional de España in Madrid in the sixties, provide what Kemp called ‘ooo ahh’ examples of Leonardo’s machines.,Leonardo did not just study birds and bats to imitate nature, which he regarded as design optimised to perfection, but tried to understand it from the basics, for instance the lift generated by a wing, so that he could ‘then act as a second nature, inventingthings that nature didn’t invent’. In this way, said Kemp, ‘you could create an infinite world of possibilities.’ The theme of remaking nature influenced Leonardo’s works of art too, such as the Mona Lisa.,In the Science Museum exhibition, you can see many of Leonardo’s drawings made real, using 39  models that were first made in Milan in 1952 to celebrate the 500th anniversary of Leonardo’s birth. ‘Having these machines from Milan here is absolutely terrific,’ said Kemp.,Among the other near life-sized models are a pyramid-shaped parachute; a floating siege weapon for crossing moats, and a crossbow measuring almost three metres across. There’s also his flying version of the ‘Archimedean screw’ that has been used since ancient times to draw up water: many call it a helicopter but Kemp pointed out that it was supposed to ‘revolve furiously’ so it was designed to transport the imagination with entertaining possibilities more than with a pilot in mind. And you can also see Leonardo’s ‘little bit crazy’ ideas for stage designs too, added Kemp.,The legacy of Leonardo’s interest in the inspiration of nature lives on in fields such as biomimicry, where scientists try to solve problems such as flight by looking at how solutions have evolved in living creatures over many millions of years. We are still in thrall to what Kemp called the ‘evolutionary magic of natural design.’ The exhibition, which is supported by Airbus, also considers the influence today of biomimicry by exploring the iterations of his research in modern robotics and aeronautics, such as the wing rib of an Airbus A380 inspired by the wing of an eagle.,Leonardo’s reputation as an inventor grew in 1952, on the 500
th
anniversary of his birth, with a major exhibition in London and Kemp paid tribute to the role in this earlier exhibition of the Science Museum,
which has been described in the Science Museum Group Journal by Jim Bennett
, who curated the small introductory display which commemorates this earlier exhibition.,Though at the instigation of Mr Gilbert, a curator of the Science Museum,  the quincentenary exhibition was held at the Royal Academy because it was thought a more appropriate venue: while Leonardo’s drawing of the ideally-proportioned Vitruvian man went on to inspire the first Italian-language version of Vitruvius’ De architectura, and he influenced future painters through his contribution to what is called the Maniera Moderna (modern style), his drawings of machines did not directly influence the history of science and engineering.,Yet Leonardo was as fertile and great an inventor as Watt, whose
workshop can be seen in the museum too
, argued Kemp, referring to how he saw the Science Museum as a ‘kind of paradise’ when he visited as a child. This and the two anniversary exhibitions in the 1950s provide a ‘historic connection’ to the one now in the museum.,In the 1950s, Leonardo was seen as the isolated genius who invented everything from refrigerators to planes to whatever, said Kemp. But today we realise many of his more plausible devices are copies of the machines that he saw emerging as the Renaissance revolution unfolded around him. Leonardo was clearly working towards a treatise of visionary machines, such as the ‘tank scuttling across a battlefield’, intended as ‘visual boasting’ to impress potential patrons, said Kemp.,Today Leonardo’s work retains the power to inspire, says Paul Kahn, UK President, Airbus Group. “Encouraging young people to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering and maths is a key priority for companies like Airbus.” He added that the Science Museum had a key role to play in this respect.,Kahn praised the ‘fantastic exhibition’ that shows the “true artistry behind engineering…just imagine what he could have done with our R and D budget today.”,Ian Blatchford, Director of the Science Museum, told the audience at how a recent visit to India had brought home to him how Leonardo is a “figure of a global importance”. Moreover, the exhibition was curated, designed and produced by two of the Science Museum’s closest collaborators in Europe -Cité des Sciences, a Universcience site, represented last night by director Bruno Maquart, and the Museo Nazionale della Scienza e della Tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci, represented by General Director Professor Fiorenzo Galli.,He also thanked Airbus Group and the players of the People’s Postcode Lottery for their support.,Above all else, said Blatchford, the work of Leonardo underlines ‘the great unity of art and science’.,Leonardo da Vinci: The Mechanics of Genius

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/anticipating-antimatter/,Harry Cliff,Anticipating Antimatter,Collider exhibition curator Dr. Harry Cliff blogs on Dirac's discoveries and anticipating antimatter.,Exhibitions and Galleries,"collider,einstein,physics","It was 86 years ago on Saturday (8 February) that one of the most important scientific papers of the 20
th
century appeared in the
Proceedings of the Royal Society
. Written by the young British physicist
Paul Dirac
, it was simply titled
A Quantum Theory of the Electron
,
and was nothing short of a theoretical triumph.,In it, Dirac had set out to solve a problem that was occupying some of the greatest minds in physics. To date, quantum mechanics had failed to explain the fine detail of atomic spectra – the discrete wavelengths of light emitted and absorbed as electrons hop between different energy levels in atoms. In particular the electron had to be given a strange property known as “spin” to explain the number of different energy levels.,Spin itself was a rather mysterious quantity. It suggested that that the electron behaved as if it was rotating rapidly on its axis, but a quick calculation showed that this couldn’t be true – the electron would have to be spinning faster than the cosmic speed limit, the speed of light, something forbidden by Einstein’s theory. It also had to be bolted on to quantum mechanics like a clumsy afterthought, without any explanation for its origin.,Dirac
, for whom mathematical beauty in the laws of physics was almost a religious cause, was deeply dissatisfied with this awkward situation. He believed that the problem lay in combining the two pillars of modern physics, quantum mechanics (the theory of the very small) and relativity (the theory of the very fast).,He was after an equation describing the behaviour of electron that was consistent with both theories, and also explained the known properties of the electron. Rather surprisingly perhaps, the approach he took was to guess.,An educated guess mind, based on some properties he knew the correct equation must possess and also on his aesthetic desire for simplicity and beauty. Working methodically, he tried equation after equation, discarding them one by one until in late November 1927 he came upon a solution.,The equation was perfect. Not only did it accurately reproduce the known energy levels of the hydrogen atom, the property of spin naturally appeared in the equation, without the need to be stuck on by hand afterwards. Spin itself now seemed to be an inevitable consequence of combining relativity and quantum mechanics.,Dirac
, though famously reserved, must have been jumping for joy (though perhaps only in his head). He had pulled off a coup so impressive that his German competitors, Jordan and Heisenberg were left stunned and deflated.,As news spread of Dirac’s success, the man himself was growing increasingly nervous about an odd feature of his equation, one that he had brushed under the carpet in his Royal Society paper.,The equation itself had four solutions, and each solution represented a state that the electron could be in. Two of these corresponded to the garden-variety electron with negative electric charge, but the other two described an electron with
positive
electric charge and
negative
energy.,This made no sense whatsoever. No one had ever seen a positively charged electron, and worse still, if these negative energy states existed then ordinary electrons should be able to fall into them, causing an electron to spontaneously switch its charge from negative to positive.,For all the success of the Dirac equation, these negative energy electrons could well have spelt its doom, and no-one was more acutely aware of this than Dirac himself. In fact, this “problem” turned out to be Dirac’s greatest contribution to physics.,It would take
Dirac
more than three years to understand the true meaning of this extra set of solutions. He had first thought that these negative energy, positively charged electrons might in fact be protons – the positively charged particles inside the atomic nucleus – but he soon realised that this would imply that protons should have the same mass as electrons, when in fact they are roughly 2000 times heavier.,What Dirac eventually reasoned was that these odd solutions actually represented a completely new type of particle, a sort of mirror image of the electron that he dubbed the “anti-electron”. Anti-electrons would look completely identical to ordinary electrons, but positively charged. He also reasoned that other particles like protons should also have anti-versions, and that when a particle met its anti-particle they would annihilate each other.,This must have seemed far-fetched at the time; after all, no one had ever seen an anti-particle. But Dirac was convinced by the beauty of his equation, and in one of the most stunning episodes in modern physics, was proven right just a year later, as Carl Anderson spotted an anti-electron in
cosmic ray experiments
.,It’s hard to overstate what Dirac had achieved. Through the power of sheer thought, he had predicted the existence of a completely new type of stuff, a stuff never before imagined by scientists. This stuff, what we now call antimatter, is just as real as the stuff you and I are made from, but for some reason doesn’t exist in large quantities in our Universe. This is in fact one of the greatest unsolved mysteries in physics, and one that physicists at the
Large Hadron Collider
are trying to solve.,Find out more about antimatter by watching

Who Am I? gallery
, we have some honey bees on display for a different reason: they have interesting genes.,Their success as a hive depends upon each bee performing his or her job. From birth, each little bee is destined to perform a role in order to keeps things running smoothly among the honeycombs.,Their job options are
worker, drone, or queen
. Male bees are always drones, while female bees will either become workers or the queen. One female bee is destined for royalty while all of her sisters have to work hard for a living.,In the Museum, you can see a queen bee side by side with a worker bee. Their appearance and fates are quite different, but their beginnings are the same. Workers and queens are born genetically identical, but external factors cause certain genes to switch on or off.,For bees these
epigenetic processes
are caused by what they eat.,All bee larvae are fed royal jelly, but while most are switched to pollen and nectar, one is chosen for an exclusive diet of royal jelly. Sticking to the royal stuff changes their role, but also their appearance and lifespan.,So could we eat our way into Buckingham Palace? Unfortunately, it doesn’t work quite the same way with humans. However, there is some proof that diet may cause epigenetic changes to our genes, and that these changes may be passed on to the next generation.,One study in The Gambia
, which has been running for nearly 70 years, shows that babies conceived in the dry season are seven times more likely to die as young adults.,This is because in the wet months green vegetables are available, which if eaten during the first few days of development provide chemicals which bind to the babies DNA, permanently changing how some genes work. Scientists are still exploring why certain genes are expressed in humans. Perhaps in the future, we will find out we really are what we eat.,How much influence do you think your diet has had on who you are?,You can see our honey bees in the

.,We are borrowing artefacts of all shapes and sizes – from small pencil drawings of early twentieth century rocket designs to Vostok 6, the full-size spacecraft that transported the
first women into space
in 1963 – from museums, private individuals and even the Russian Space Agency.,We began the logistical planning for the exhibition two years ago, visiting Moscow many times to inspect the artefacts and meet with our partners and transport agent. In May 2015, all the years of planning were finally put into action.,The first stage was to get all the large spacecraft from Moscow and into the Museum so that the exhibition could be built around them. As they are too big to fit inside any aircraft that regularly fly from Moscow to London, we transported the spacecraft in 20m long, 4 tonne trucks from Moscow to Helsinki and then by ferry to the UK.,The epic journey took a week from start to finish, and I had the pleasure of accompanying the spacecraft on their journey.,After clearing customs in Moscow, we were joined for the 1000km, two days journey to the Russian-Finnish border by an armed security escort. At the border we joined a long queue of lorries.,Our export licences were checked and stamped by customs officials, the trucks were weighed, X-rayed and sealed, and we passed through passport control. This can take up to twenty four hours, but thankfully we crossed into Finland within six.,At Helsinki, the trucks boarded a ferry and set sail for the four-day crossing to the UK. Four days later we docked at Immingham, cleared customs and then drove down to London.,The next challenge was unloading the spacecraft at the Museum. Due to their sheer size and weight, we used cranes to lift the spacecraft off the trucks, but even just moving the spacecraft through the Museum was no mean feat.,Long before the spacecraft left Moscow we did a practice run with a giant beach ball, which had the same dimensions as the Vostok 6 spacecraft, to see which display cases and furniture would have to be moved along the route.,Then finally the spacecraft had to be hoisted up to the first floor of the Museum and moved into the gallery.,One of the star spacecraft in
Cosmonauts
(and that is saying something) is the extraordinary LK-3 Luna Lander. This is a 3 tonne, 5m tall training model of the spacecraft that would have landed a single cosmonaut on the moon.,Due to its ginormous size, the Lander had to first be dismantled at the Moscow Aviation Institute in order to be transported to London. In fact, this is the longest journey the Lander has ever taken.,At the beginning we didn’t think the Lander would fit into the Museum, but thankfully the Lander can be dismantled into sections: a top, middle, bottom and four legs, or in more technical words, the docking port, cabin, engine and four landing pads.,A week later, and inside the Science Museum, we reassembled the Luna Lander. Returning it to its full glory took four days, using hoists, gantries, lifting beams and the expertise of an external rigging company and Russian engineers.,It was a real international effort to get the Lander ready for public display in the UK and it is now in pride of place in the Cosmonauts exhibition… but to see it you’ll have to wait until the exhibition opens.,Cosmonauts: Birth of the Space Age
is open from 18 September 2015 – 13 March 2016. The exhibition is supported by BP and has additional support from ART RUSSE (Major Funder) and the Blavatnik Family Foundation."

It is allowing members of the public to rummage through its bins, writes artist Joshua Sofaer.","At the Museum,Exhibitions and Galleries","art,climate,recycling,the rubbish collection","The Rubbish Collection
is a two-part art installation, which will see every single thing thrown out by the Science Museum staff and visitors for 30 days, photographed in a purpose-built temporary archive in the basement of the Wellcome wing. Members of the public will be invited to open the bags of rubbish and layout the contents on an archive table, photograph their arrangement, before repacking the contents in the bag and sending it on its route towards recycling or incineration.,We will then follow the journey that the rubbish takes and will recall it to the Science Museum at various stages in its transformation, for the second part of the project:
an exhibition
of waste materials. Visitors will be able to see the elements and quantity of stuff thrown out by one institution.,Humans are avid collectors. We are also nosy. We enjoy investigating the things around us and seeing material culture collated, labelled and
exhibited
. It was this impulse that was the incentive for the first museums. The Rubbish Collection, which will soon fill the exhibition space below, inverts the idea of the museum preserving what is sacred or unique, asking us to consider what we choose to keep, what we discard, and why.,,By handling the waste themselves, I hope the public will notice how recycling bins are often contaminated and also how perfectly good resources are sent off needlessly for incineration when they could be reused or recycled.,Mirroring the conventional museum displays that are adjacent, The Rubbish Collection exhibition will confront visitors with a literal representation of one institution’s waste, while focusing attention on the urgent need for waste reduction.,It’s a step into uncharted territory and a courageous thing for the Science Museum to do; allowing the public to rummage through its bins. It shows that their commitment to tackling issues connected to climate change, sustainability and carbon efficiency, starts with themselves.,Rubbish bags are also repositories for stories of our lives. Opening one and laying out the contents is a kind of contemporary archaeology that stimulates the imagination, as we deduce or invent the histories of the materials before us.,,Seeing the towers of paper, above, or mountains of glass sand, is similarly not only about recognising the need for more sustainable living, it is also about acknowledging the aesthetic properties and the wonder of the everyday stuff that surrounds us.,Joshua Sofaer is the artist that organised The Rubbish Collection. The project runs from 16 June to 14 September 2014. For more information,

The Matter Factory: A History of the Chemistry Laboratory
‘.,The laboratory clearly plays an important role in chemistry (and other sciences). Chemists will have received their practical training in the teaching laboratory before spending their career (in many cases) working in a variety of laboratories in academia and industry. Yet this important setting for chemistry has hitherto been little studied. Previous studies of laboratories have almost invariably been an examination of what a chemist or chemists have done in that laboratory rather than the laboratory building itself. And the few papers or books on the design or fittings of the laboratory have restricted themselves to a single laboratory or a specific period.,,My latest book
The Matter Factory
is the first book to consider the development of the laboratory over four hundred years. I examine how the early alchemical workshops dominated by the furnace became the standard chemistry laboratory (what I call the classical chemistry laboratory) between the 1830s and 1860s, mostly in Germany and London with its central aisle, benches and bottle racks. This was not just a matter of architectural design or new fittings – it also required the introduction of gas, water and steam into the laboratory and plumbed-in drainage. These changes enabled the development of new fields of chemistry including atomic spectroscopy and organic synthesis as well as the training of an ever increasing number of chemistry students.,For many years, well into the twentieth century, this mass training employed inorganic group analysis as a tool. However this group analysis used toxic hydrogen sulphide as a reagent leading to the development of the fume cupboard and even fume boxes on the bench. The classical laboratory spread from its initial home in Germany to other countries, initially Britain and America, then to Japan and France by the 1890s. This type of laboratory was also quickly adopted by the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. While the classical laboratory endured for over a century, a new type of laboratory employing a more flexible design has recently been introduced, for example, at Oxford University.,As well as looking at the design and content of laboratories, I have also studied other aspects of laboratory work, such as techniques and apparatus. They have included several items in the Science Museum’s own collections as such the bizarre gas thermostat (1888-307) invented by Robert Bunsen of burner fame and the demonstration apparatus introduced by Wilhelm Hofmann. While the so-called Hofmann voltammeter (to show the splitting of water by electricity) is well-known, he also popularised apparatus to demonstrate other reactions such as the reaction between sulphur dioxide and oxygen (1876-220). I have also argued that the widespread use of the white laboratory coat may be much later than commonly assumed.,You can buy The Matter Factory from the Science Museum shop or at our online shop

Building Bridges
project.,An amazing VIP late-night event occurred at the Science Museum last week for students involved in the
Building Bridges
project.  The students have been working with us all year and this special celebration was a chance for them to show off the work they have done to their families, and get involved in a variety of exciting activities such as extracting strawberry DNA, eating ice cream made with liquid nitrogen, testing their tolerance of chillies and getting creative with
SM:Art Mechanics
.,For the past three years the
Building Bridges
project has been working with schools across London and Reading to expose and engage students with science inside and outside the classroom, and at home with their families. All of the students involved have followed a year-long programme made up of
Outreach
shows,
classroom resources
,
museum activities
, workshops with research scientists and family activities.,The project hopes to use the new resources that have been developed to better engage families in STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths). All of the resources have been researched throughout the project and we hope that they will help support both informal and formal learning.,This year students have all worked really hard and contributed to their own exhibition, ‘Guardians of the Gallery’, which was showcased at the VIP event. This exhibition showcased objects that the students had chosen to represent how science and technology helps us to solve everyday problems. For example, a dress made from LEDs with a solar-powered handbag was chosen as something that you could wear to a VIP event, a self-driving car was the travel option of choice for one student working out how they were going to get to their holiday destination, and a daylight simulating lamp was suggested by one student as something that would help them get up early.,With the help of some incredible teachers, wonderful students and the helpful teams within our Learning department, the
Building Bridges
project has been able to develop and deliver a number of new, successful activities and events for this year’s programme. We are looking forward to meeting the students taking part in the project next year, and using the research findings to increase science engagement and literacy even further.,If you are looking for exciting activities for your family in the Museum head to our

Penicillin
. The first antibiotic to be discovered and mass-produced, it appeared to be a wonder drug which enabled doctors to effectively treat infection for the first time in history.,In 1928, Dr Alexander Fleming returned from holiday to find a mould growing in one of the Petri dishes in his lab. Upon closer inspection under a microscope, he discovered the mould was preventing the growth of bacteria in the dish, and he came to a remarkable conclusion: the Penicillium mould could potentially be used to fight infection.,It was 10 years later that Fleming’s discovery was picked up and worked on by a team at Oxford University. The team, in collaboration with American scientists, developed Fleming’s discovery into an effective drug which could be mass produced. This crucial breakthrough came during World War II, when vast quantities of the lifesaving antibiotic were desperately needed for treating a range of war-related infections.,The substance in
our bottle
is some of the first penicillin to have been manufactured, clinically tested and used by the military. In an effort to begin mass producing the drug, a solution was made by a chemical company and then sent on a truck to a team in Oxford University. Their job was to take the weak solution, extract the valuable penicillin from it and purify it.  The browny-yellow colour is due to remaining impurities in the sample.,However, as Fleming correctly predicted in his
Nobel Prize Lecture
, the misuse of Penicillin would cause harmful microbes to become resistant to the antibiotic.,Today, antibiotic resistance poses a serious threat to progress, as people are dying from bacterial infections which used to be treatable. It is thought
25 million
courses of antibiotics are incorrectly prescribed every year in the UK for ailments such as
coughs and colds
that don’t require the use of this valuable treatment. To combat this growing issue, the
Longitude Prize
set a challenge to design a test that will help healthcare professionals administer antibiotics correctly, with a £10 million prize for the winning idea.,Do you think the development of Penicillin was the most important medical breakthrough in history, or are there other more important advances?,Laura Body is a member of the Learning Support Team.,To see this object and discover more about the story of penicillin, visit the

.,The title refers to the time it takes for the
International Space Station
to orbit the earth, 16 circumnavigations a day taking around an hour and a half each, offering a different perspective to its small band of inhabitants every time. As
he writes
in the introduction ‘…I never tired of looking out of the window. I don’t think any astronaut ever has, or will. Every chance we have, we float over to see what’s changed since we last went around the Earth.’ In the process he took around 45,000 photographs, capturing the surface of where most we live from a place hardly any of us will ever see.,Hadfield began posting his images on
Twitter
and soon garnered over 1 million followers. His desire to share his experiences in space with others has meant that he’s become a bit of a social media celebrity with a popular
Tumblr
blog and
YouTube
channel (over 24 million people have watched his rendition of
Space Oddity
performed while floating in space). During a period where space travel has dropped off most people’s radar, Hadfield has reignited the ‘every man’ sense of wonder about space. Rather than focussing on the technology, he has, once again, shown us just how
cool
being an astronaut really is.,Hadfield’s interview with Dan Walker and Sarah Brett on Afternoon Edition will take place in MOSI’s historic 1830 Warehouse, part of a complex built around the terminus of a very different type of transport, the first passenger railway. He’ll be chatting in front of 50 year 10 students from local schools and answering their questions on life in space. Though retired, Hadfield remains a popular figure with a unique perspective on life.,In a 2013
interview
with The Guardian, he revealed one of his philosophies: ‘… if someone is willing to teach you something for free, take them up on it. Do it. Every single time. All it does is make you more likely to be able to succeed. And it’s kind of a nice way to go through life.’ This is great advice, especially with so many fantastic museums nearby. Just like seeing one of Hadfield’s tweets, visiting museums can be a discovery point, a place to see something you’ve never seen before. Who knows where that might lead? Maybe even outer space."

But before this automatic system was introduced, telephone exchange operators had to help us on our way.,In the first half of the 20
th
century, women worked across the country, connecting calls and helping people get in touch with one another. The work required concentration, patience and an excellent manner, but the community created within these exchanges was fun and social once shifts had ended.,One of the last manual telephone exchanges was based at Enfield, north London. The Enfield Exchange’s switch from manual to automatic exchange, marked the end of an era in communication history. A section of the Enfield Exchange, donated to the Science Museum by BT, forms a part of the Museum’s collection, and will go on display in the new
Information Age
gallery.,To bring this amazing piece of history to life, we spoke to women who worked as telephone exchange operators in the 1950s and early 1960s, recording their stories through oral history interviews.,These former ‘hello girls’ gave their insight into how the exchange worked and what the job of an operator involved, but also shared wonderful stories about the friends they made and the social life they experienced once they’d clocked off.,One of these former operators, Jean Singleton, shared her thoughts on what made a good telephone operator, even if she didnít feel she was one!,‘How do I know? [Laughs] I wasn’t a good telephone operator, I was a naughty telephone operator! Well, first of all, you had to have a nice speaking voice, you couldn’t go there if you were a Cockney, speaking in a Cockney way, or a Northern way, you had to speak the Queen’s English, or King’s English as it was then. I suppose I had a decent enough voice. You had to be polite, and the customer sort of was always right, more or less, you know, you didn’t swear back at somebody if they swore at you, you weren’t allowed to do that sort of thing. If you found you were in trouble with a person on the telephone, you just passed them over to your supervisor, and they would deal with it.’,Another former operator, Rose Young, talked about some of the kit that was used whilst working on the exchange.,‘The first headsets were very heavy, you’d have a mouthpiece that came up in front of you on a plastic piece that had a tape on that you hung round your neck. And then the headpiece was like a metal band with a very heavy earpiece, you had one ear free so that you could hear what was going on around you and one that you covered, that covered your ear, but they were very heavy.’,Visitors to

explains her
latest experiment
at the museum, exploring the science behind laughter.,Last year, we had a mouse somewhere in our flat, and we were all stressing out about it a bit. I was at home on my own when I thought I felt something running over my foot. It was a hair pin falling out of my hair, but before I had realized this, I screamed out loud. I screamed loud enough and long enough for me to have time to think things like “Why am I screaming?”, “I am not afraid of mice” and “Pretty sure that was a hairpin”.,The really interesting part of the mouse incident was that my scream was involuntary – I really did not mean to do this (there’s a great example
here
). Involuntary vocalizations are produced via a neural system we share with other mammals, but a separate network in the brain controls speech. This speech network, which evolved much later, allows us to produce the complex movements which underlie
speech and song
and to do so voluntarily – we choose when to speak.,The older, involuntary system is associated with emotional vocalizations in humans – like my screaming or a cry of surprise. These emotional sounds (such as crying, screaming, laughing) are more like animal calls than they are like speech.,Our more recent voluntary system is associated with speech and song (and other vocal skills such as beatboxing). If this system is damaged, for example, due to a stroke, people can be left with aphasia – a persistent problem with talking. They very often can still make emotional noises, such as laughing, suggesting that the stroke has not damaged this older pathway.,For my
research
, we are studying what it means to make voluntary and involuntary vocalizations – for example, laughter is used a great deal during conversational speech. Even babies use emotional expressions like crying and laughter in extremely sophisticated ways.,This all suggests that there may be both voluntary and involuntary kinds of emotional sounds. Are laughs and sobs produced in a voluntary or an involuntary fashion really different? How do they sound to us? How does this change as we age?,To help discover the answers to these questions, we are running
an experiment
at the Science Museum. We ask people to listen to ‘real’ and ‘posed’ laughter and sobbing sounds to find out how they sound to people. So if you are interested in knowing anything more about voices and emotion do please come along and take part in
our research
– we promise not to make you scream."

Collider exhibition
, Content Developer Rupert Cole celebrates six decades of research at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research.,Just before the Large Hadron Collider first turned on in September 2008, there was (in some quarters) a panic that it would destroy the world.,Doomsday was all over the media. “Are we all going to die next Wednesday?” asked one headline. Even when CERN submitted a
peer-reviewed safety report
in an attempt to allay fears, it didn’t altogether quash the dark mutterings and comic hysteria: “Collider will not turn world to goo, promise scientists.”,In case you were wondering, the LHC has
subsequently proved
to be completely safe, and has even found the
Higgs Boson
to boot.,In fact, this isn’t the first time
CERN
has provoked fears of world destruction. In the lead-up to the signing of CERN’s founding Convention – 60 years ago this month – the proposed organisation was greatly hindered and influenced by apocalypse anxiety.,Only, back then, it had nothing to do with
micro black holes
swallowing the earth or
strangelet
particles messing with matter. No such exotic phenomena were needed. Just the mention of the words
nuclear
and
atomic
was enough to provoke serious paranoia in the Cold-War climate.,In 1949
Denis de Rougement
, a Swiss writer and influential advocate for a federal Europe, attended the European Cultural Conference — one of the early conferences in which a “European Centre for Atomic Research” was discussed. “To speak of atomic research at that time,” de Rougement reflected, “was immediately to evoke, if not the possibility of blowing up the whole world, then at least preparations for a third world war.”,The press undoubtedly subscribed to the more extreme school of thought. On the second day of the conference, all the scientists present had to be locked in a chamber for protection as they had been pestered so severely by journalists on the previous day.,In some of the initial discussions, a nuclear reactor as well as an accelerator was proposed for the European research centre. It was carefully stressed that no commercial applications would be developed and all military work scrupulously excluded.,The French, who led these early proposals, removed the director of the French Atomic Energy Commission, the communist-leaning
Frederic Joliot-Curie,
after
J. Robert Oppenheimer
(of Manhattan Project fame) stated the Americans wouldn’t support a project that included a senior figure with Soviet sympathies.,The nuclear reactor was dropped when Hungarian-American physicist
Isidor I. Rabi
, the so-called “father” of CERN,  stepped on the scene. Rabi, who co-founded the American research centre
Brookhaven National Laboratory

tell stories of user innovation, from Tim Berners-Lee’s NeXT Cube computer to the Pilot ACE used by Alan Turing.,These amazing stories show the huge potential of computers, and our new tinkering workshop, Code Builder, aims to build on these further.,After an introduction, the group is set a task to use basic coding language to devise and input procedures into an online programme, test, rework them and see live results. These results come in the form of a small robot, Robotiky, which is programmed using bespoke online software.,Coded instructions are written and simulated on screen, and then sent to the robot via a USB connection, allowing the students to see their code in action. The session encourages the development of logic and computational thinking skills, through trial and error, as well as exploring the interaction between hardware, robot, software and computer programme.,This workshop is designed to complement a number of areas of the computing curriculum at key stages 3 and 4. These include evaluating and applying information technology to solve problems, as well as helping pupils understand the hardware and software components that make up computer systems and how they communicate with one another and other systems.,Code Builder runs twice a day every Thursday during term time.

2014 marks the 26
th
World AIDS Day
. The UNAIDS ‘90-90-90’ initiative sets ambitious global targets to end the epidemic by 2030. So how far have we come since the epidemic gained global attention in the 1980s? Here at the Science Museum we decided to explore this question with our new exhibit –
The end of AIDS?,The focal point of the exhibit is an animation called
‘Growing up with HIV’
. It was created in collaboration with an inspiring group of young people who live with HIV and the
National Children’s Bureau
. It tells the story of a young mum-to-be looking forward to the birth of her first child, while she reflects on her life and what it was like to grow up with HIV.,The group created the animation in just four workshops. First they visited the Who Am I? gallery, where they learned about our visitors and science communication. We then discussed what HIV means to them and interviewed an expert about what it does. Over the following sessions we narrowed down what were the most important messages and how to help visitors relate to them.,A key idea was to challenge some of the commonly held misconceptions by explaining what HIV does and the success of current treatment. They decided to tell a personal story about the struggles we can all face growing up.,Struggle and progress turned out to be a strong theme for the animation – referring both to science (trying to improve treatment for HIV) and people (trying to live full, healthy and happy lives).,The rest of the display was built up around the conversations we had during the workshops and from talking with experts. A key message is the importance of testing. In the UK 20% of the estimated 100,000 people who live with HIV are not aware of their infection. In the display we included a postal sampling kit from the Terrence Higgins Trust, which is available for free to high-risk groups.,You can also find a concert programme from the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert for AIDS Awareness, held in 1992. It was at this event that 100,000 red ribbons were first distributed in the UK. The ribbon is now the iconic symbol of public awareness and support for people living with HIV and AIDS.,From our stores we brought out a collection of drug packaging which represents all the drugs an HIV patient may have taken in one month in 1999. Today some patients can take just one pill a day and trials have begun for a monthly injection. The last section of the display looks at the latest research and includes the story of Timothy Ray Brown – the only person to have been cured of HIV.,I hope you will be able to visit the display and find it as enlightening and inspiring as I have working on it. I’d like to end this post with a few words from our group:,‘We are all going through our own struggles, but we can achieve anything we want’.,Nicola Burghall is a Content Developer at the Museum.

During his time on Mir he experienced a power cut, a collision and a fire on the station.,He was joined by space law and colonisation expert Dr Jill Stuart and philosopher Professor Angie Hobbs. They participated in a fascinating panel discussion in our IMAX Theatre on the topic of whether humans are destined to live in space, which was chaired by Doug Millard, Senior Curator for the Cosmonauts exhibition.,,Lazutkin, Stuart, Hobbs and Millard on stage © Science Museum,The cultural roots of the Russian space programme were in cosmological and mystical thinking, and in the belief that humanity’s destiny was to colonise the cosmos. The forefather of Russian cosmonautics, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky famously said ‘Earth is the cradle of humanity, but one cannot live in a cradle forever’.,,In our own era, the motivations of nations and private companies to initiate and maintain space projects are just as varied and complex. Geopolitical positioning and colonisation, the search for extra-terrestrial life, the pursuit of materials for mining, the desire for scientific knowledge and the simple, primal urge to satisfy human desire are all incentives to travel beyond Earth’s boundaries.,,Stuart talked about the legislation related to space exploration including the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, which forms the basis of international
space law
and exclusively limits the use of the Moon and other celestial bodies to peaceful purposes. It also states that these celestial bodies are the
common heritage of mankind
and cannot be claimed by a particular government or nation. She discussed the rise of non-government, commercial and private enterprises partaking in space missions such as SpaceX, Mars One and Planetary Resources. What does this mean for space colonisation and the potential permanent human habitation off planet Earth?! Governments are no longer the sole players in space development. Who then will determine the laws that govern our behaviour and activities in space? How will we interact with one another in outer space?,Hobbs talked about the ethics around space travel. By messing with other planets, such as asteroid mining, we may destroy yet undiscovered life or ruin the potential for future life. What’s to prevent problems on Earth from following us into outer space, if we have not evolved the attitudes and behaviours that have contributed to those problems? We have destroyed our planet through pollution, global warming and war. Should we be redirecting the significant investments in space exploration to solve more pressing problems on Earth, such as alleviating poverty and hunger?,,Another interesting question raised was should we send humans to explore other planets when robots might do the job just as well but more safely and less expensively? There is a big debate around whether human space travel is worth the money and risk.,,Lazutkin was very positive about human space travel. He said that one views Earth differently from space. Nations are united in space, but unfortunately this harmony is absent on Earth. He shared some amazing photos of his mission to the Mir space station which gave a real insight into what it is like to live in space. He also told a very comical story about his colleague throwing a fork at him over the dinner table back on Earth because he had got so accustomed to the weightlessness in space!,,Lazutkin’s presentation © Science Museum,The discussion about whether humans are destined to live in space is a complex one. It has given rise to many social, ethical and political issues, and so the question remains open…,,Cosmonauts: Birth of the Space Age

has died aged 65
.,“Dame Zaha Hadid was an audacious architect and a great collaborator with the Science Museum. The death of such a brilliant pioneer is a dreadful loss to the worlds of science and design.,Our
new Mathematics gallery
will be the first permanent public exhibition in the world to be designed by Zaha Hadid Architects.,Her sculptural designs set a new standard when it comes to crystallising abstract mathematical thinking into beautiful physical forms. With her unique mathematical background and architectural vision, she has been a beacon of inspiration for young women everywhere.,The Museum sends its condolences to Zaha’s family and friends at this time. We will continue to work with her practice in the coming months to realise Zaha’s designs for our new Mathematics gallery, that we hope will provide a lasting tribute to her.”,Zaha Hadid, the Iraqi-British architect was born in 1950 and raised in one of Baghdad’s first Bauhaus-inspired houses. “In Iraq, maths was taught as a way of life,”
she later recalled
, at an event to
celebrate her commission
to design the Mathematics gallery. “We used to just do maths to resolve problems continuously, as if we were sketching.”,Dame Zaha vividly recalled a trip with her parents to the Science Museum. “It was for me at the time extremely fascinating to see instruments and understand about science. And, around the same time, I also went to art museums. I used to come every summer to London when I was in my teens.”,She went on to study mathematics at the American University of Beirut. The explosion of interest in construction and modernity of the 1960s encouraged her to study at the Architectural Association School of Architecture in London.,She became one of the most sought-after architects on the planet, the only female recipient of the prestigious
Pritzker Architecture Prize
, considered the Nobel Prize of the field, and was also awarded the Royal Institute of British Architects’
2016 Royal Gold Medal
.,Her work has its roots in movement that is a century old, notably with the Russian abstract artist Kazimir Malevich. The dire economic situation in the West in the seventies “fostered in us similar ambitions: we thought to apply radical new ideas to regenerate society.”,In September 2014, Dame Zaha
spoke
about her designs for our new Mathematics Gallery:"

Wounded: Conflict, Casualties and Care
exhibition, I’ve become acquainted with a range of fascinating objects used during the First World War.,Among those I readied for display, my favourite is the
field surgical pannier set
, which was made in Britain in 1905 and would have been used in field hospitals near the front line.,I particularly like the pannier set because of the many remarkable smaller objects – over 100 – inside the case. They include instruments used to open up the body and stitch wounds, as well as mundane items such as bandages and plasters. There’s also a saline infusion apparatus that was used to wash wounds, dilute drugs and provide a substitute for blood plasma.,The interior of the pannier and the items inside were treated extensively last year by Louise Stewart Beck, who worked on almost all the objects going on display.,However, the exterior – specifically the pannier’s leather components – also needed conservation. And that’s where I came in.,My task involved documenting the pannier’s condition, cleaning it, repairing certain areas where the leather was lifting and tearing, and stabilising spots on the surface that were crumbling.,Parts of the leather were suffering from ‘red rot’, a form of degradation – not actually rot, despite the name – that occurs in vegetable tanned leathers from the late 1800s and early 1900s. It usually appears as a reddish colour and a crumbling surface, and results from high temperatures and high humidity. To fix the problem I used a ‘consolidant’ to treat the surface locally, which helped to stop the crumbling and stabilise the pannier for the future.,Because of its age and how it was used, other areas of the leather – mostly the bottom edges and corners – had split and were lifting from the wicker interior. The location of the damage and the reduced flexibility of the material made this one of the trickier parts of the job.,In some cases the treatment was as straightforward as sticking down the leather with an adhesive, but for other sections that were fragile and unable to bend I had to resort to humidification. Where the leather needed extra support to reattach to the wicker, I used Japanese tissue paper colour matched to the brown leather as a kind of patch.,Treating the surgical pannier set was both interesting and informative. I look forward to seeing it on display in the exhibition, and I’m sure others will enjoy learning from it just as I have.,Vanessa Applebaum is an intern in the conservation team at the Science Museum.,Wounded: Conflict, Casualties and Care

Our Lives in Data
, explores how our connected lives can reveal patterns. Technology-based exhibitions are often filled with increasingly tiny gadgets, but in this new exhibition, we had to go big.,We’ve been working with
Facebook
in order to show Museum visitors a real server from a data centre. Data centres are the physical infrastructure of the internet: when you post a photo online or send an email, it’s stored in one of these machines in a data centre that could be anywhere in the world.,We were lucky enough to get one of these servers from Facebook’s
data centre in Lulea, Sweden
. It was fantastic to get such an amazing object for display at the Museum, but a bit of a challenge to move it into its new home in the exhibition.,Facebook had arranged to have the server shipped from Sweden to the Museum, but for us, that was just the beginning of the journey. The huge object is about the size of a refrigerator and weighs just over 800 kg, more than a fully grown cow.,The weight was immediately an issue. We had structural engineers examine our floors and the building design to make sure that having so much pressure on any part of the floor wouldn’t cause any unexpected damage.,With the all clear, we wheeled the server through the Museum to its display case and the next challenge: the display case is about two feet off the ground.,To get the server into position in the exhibition, we built a crane around it to hoist it up. It took four workers and three hours to hoist the machine those two feet up and ease it into the case.,They had to be extra careful too, as we only had about 5 millimetres of wiggle room. There were a few tense moments, but the server is now ready to be seen by curious Museum-goers.,But it’s not only the objects in the exhibition that proved to be tricky, and some of our cases are quite heavy too.,As a part of
Our Lives in Data

explores how our online behaviour, our travel, and even our DNA is being recorded by interested organisations.,,Today in the UK it’s thought that about 27% of retail stores are using some form of recognition camera to monitor who’s walking through their doors. It might be terrifying to think that our faces are being logged without our knowledge, but we should also consider the purpose of this kind of data collection.,In this case, shops are looking to see what types of people are coming in to browse; they care about demographics, not about individuals. How effective was the marketing campaign geared towards teenagers? Do we need to advertise more clothing to men? Do people come in as a family, or alone?,These questions don’t particularly create an invasion of privacy as they could potentially be answered by an observant person with a clipboard at the door instead of with a camera. So why is it that when a person writes down what we’re up to it is called market research, but when a camera (or a phone or a search engine) does the same, it’s a violation of privacy?,One of the major barriers we’ve come across while developing the
Our Lives in Data
exhibition is how inaccessible this technology is. When a camera sees us, it doesn’t announce itself or state its intentions like a person might. At the very least a person with a clipboard can be spoken to. But a camera is unnervingly impersonal and hidden in that increasingly magical realm we call ‘digital technology’. The issue may not be that we’re being logged, rather how it’s being done.,It’s this lack of transparency that we find again and again as being the major barrier to understanding and accepting this level of observation, and it is something we are exploring in our exhibition.,We’re all guilty of skipping the terms and conditions. Perhaps it’s time to see a new way to understand what’s happening to our data.

Mathematics: The Winton Gallery
. But how do we make this sometimes divisive subject engaging for the museum’s broad audiences?,The work of developing new galleries, exhibitions and programmes at the Science Museum is underpinned by detailed audience research. In 2009 we commissioned research into visitors’ attitudes towards mathematics and expectations of a new gallery on this topic. It showed unequivocally that encouraging visitors across the threshold of a mathematics gallery is a significant challenge. Most visitors expressed little innate curiosity about mathematics, confidence levels were rock-bottom and, for some, a sense of failure dominated their feelings towards the subject.,,As one adult participant in our research described: “At school… if you didn’t get it right the first time you were reduced to nothing, so the thought of maths makes me break out in a cold sweat.”,But not all was lost.,The research also showed that visitors are interested in the tangible, real-world impacts of mathematics and in the connections between mathematics and their lives. And this is where the museum has a unique advantage. The Science Museum Group has the world’s greatest collection of objects relating to science, engineering, medicine, technology, design, transport and media. These collections embody the modern world and the mathematics which underpins it.,Mathematics: The Winton Gallery
draws on the strengths of this broad collection to illustrate how mathematics has been involved in all areas of our lives and work. Some objects will be familiar, like the National Lottery Machine, Guinevere.,Others may be less familiar but speak eloquently about the role of mathematics in aspects of our lives with are visible, tangible and relevant: a mathematical device for calculating the strength of concrete in a story about how buildings stay up.,Others, like a beautifully-designed chair, immediately ignite curiosity: what’s this got to do with mathematics?,The answer is revealed in a story about proportion. The chair was designed by Charlotte Perriand for the architect Le Corbusier who believed that all manufactured products should be designed according to mathematical rules of proportion.,,Our audience research also showed clearly that visitors find it hard to imagine who mathematicians
are
and what they do. Experts in mathematics engagement have shown that students form opinions of themselves as mathematicians (or not) early on in their educational journey and overwhelmingly believe that mathematicians work in schools and universities.,The museum visitors we spoke to also struggled to imagine that mathematics is done and used by people who may not have the word ‘mathematician’ in their job title. In contrast,
Mathematics: The Winton Gallery
will feature women and men working in fields as diverse as oceanography, structural engineering and medical research.,The audience research and learning approach developed for
Mathematics: The Winton Gallery

(science-related qualifications, interest, literacy and social contacts) with Kings College London.,This work aims to better understand how young people from all backgrounds engage with science and how the museum can support them.

Medicine galleries
some of the objects are being re-homed in different parts of the museum. Next month the giant (four-tonne) mirror from the Rosse telescope will be taking up residence in
Making of the Modern World
. Ahead of the move, and in honour of Women’s History Month, Assistant Curator Rupert Cole has been looking into the remarkable life of one of its previous owners, Mary Rosse.,,Mary Rosse had unconventional hobbies for a nineteenth-century Irish countess. Her activities spanned architecture, astronomy, engineering and photography. She was also one of the most well-connected women in scientific circles of her day.,Born in 1813 in Bradford to a considerably-wealthy Yorkshire family, Mary (née Field) had a lively and privileged upbringing, from dancing lessons in Bath to extensive mathematical studies, the latter filling several volumes of notebooks.,In 1836 Mary married
William Parsons
, a serious man, 13 years her senior. He was said to be good-looking, though his plump figure inspired from one cousin the rather unkind nickname, ‘the fat Lord’. Nevertheless, they were well matched, sharing scientific interests.,The 1840s was an eventful decade for the Parsons. They became Lord and Lady Rosse in 1841, taking charge of the ancestral home, Birr Castle, in the Irish midlands.  Mary embarked upon a series of architectural projects at the castle, from the construction of a star-shaped moat to a new tower. Many of her design models still survive.,At this time, her husband undertook an extremely-ambitious and expensive project, made possible by Mary’s vast inheritance, to build a giant 6-foot telescope. Completed in 1845, the so-called ‘Leviathan of Parsontown’ remained the world’s largest telescope for over 70 years and even got a mention in Jules Verne’s science fiction classic,
From the Earth to the Moon
(1865):,‘We know that the instrument mounted by Lord Rosse at Parsonstown, which magnifies 6,500 times, brings the moon to within an apparent distance of sixteen leagues.’,Shortly after, Mary began an engineering venture of her own. She designed, creating a model from wax, a new iron keep gate, complete with decorative flowers and Irish harps. It is believed she cast them herself in the same workshop as the telescope, using furnaces fuelled by peat from the local bog.,One biographer
has claimed this is evidence that Mary was involved in the construction of the telescope as well. The silence over her contribution in Lord Rosse’s account, they speculated, was owing to Mary wishing for her husband to get full credit.,The Parsons did much to help their community during the Great Famine. Mary’s charitable work was acknowledged by the
Illustrated London News
, who reported ‘she has taken the most lively interest in the poor’. By 1846 the Rosse estate would provide employment for 130 men.,Another of Mary’s Birr projects was the creation of a massive dining room for the purpose of entertaining scientific guests, which increased when Lord Rosse became President of the Royal Society of London in 1848. Among the many famous men of science she became acquainted with was the famous mathematician

The Radiophonic Workshop
will always be inextricably linked with memories of peeking out at Cybermen from behind their sofa. The pulsing rhythms of Delia Derbyshire’s theme tune went on to represent the beginnings of The Workshop’s unique form of early electronica. This pioneering music studio had been set up by a group of BBC employees as demand had grown for innovative synthetic music and sounds for radio and television. Through developing these sounds The Workshop would go on to inspire musicians from across the world and create a new genre of synthetic soundscapes.,,Although the Dr. Who theme tune is the best known piece to emerge from The Radiophonic Workshop, the studio produced an enormous amount of incidental music, sound effects and jingles that sound-tracked BBC TV and Radio from the late 1950’s to the 1990’s.,Now The Radiophonic Workshop are launching their first studio album in 32 years –
Burials in Several Earths
. The Science Museum recently opened
Mathematics: The Winton Gallery
and The Workshop’s album launch presented the perfect opportunity to invite them to the Science Museum to explore the mathematical side of electronic music.,Our permanent collection holds some fantastic gems from the early days of electronic music in Britain. In 2010 the Museum acquired the Oramics machine, invented by one of The Radiophonic Workshop founders, Daphne Oram.,,The Radiophonic Workshop’s array of new sounds inspired artists and electronic musicians including the Beatles and the Electronic Music Studios (EMS). Visitors to our
Making The Modern World
gallery can see an example of the EMS VCS 3 synthesizer, another piece of British music history which was popular with progressive rock stars including Brian Eno, Pink Floyd and The Who.,,At the heart of British electronic music history is a group of engineers and artists who enjoyed tinkering with synthetic sound. Their understanding of wave-forms and wiring is just one example of the creative paths that an understanding of mathematics can lead musicians and artists down.,Join us on Friday 16th June to hear
The Radiophonic Workshop
live in surround sound and take part in a Q&A with Dr.Tim Boon the Museum’s Head of Research & Public History and The Radiophonic Workshop.

Science and the post-truth era
–
with guests Fiona Fox, Matthew d’Ancona, James Ball and Evan Davis.,When the Royal Society was established in 1660 it came up with the motto
Nullius in verba
, which means ‘take nobody’s word for it’.,Even at its birth, what has become the world’s oldest surviving learned society realised that science isn’t about asserting truths that have been handed down on tablets of stone by authority figures.,Science is about verifying statements by an appeal to facts that have been determined by measurements as part of a never-ending dialogue between theory and experiment. It is about scepticism, providing clear descriptions of research studies, being open with data and explaining why they support or refute a given idea.,But we now find ourselves in a post-truth universe, where facts kowtow to personal belief, there is ‘policy-based evidence making’, any science that challenges dogma with inconvenient truths is curtailed and where emotion seems to be regaining the ascendancy over reason.,How could truth suddenly become so passé?,That is why the Science Museum has invited the authors of three critically acclaimed books about the post-truth era to meet in public for the first time with Fiona Fox, Director of the
Science Media Centre
:,,“Every time I think I have this post-truth thing nailed someone reminds me that ‘twas ever thus’” she says. “My role as chair will be to try to pin these three thinkers down to what if anything is really new and whether tried and tested ways of fighting for facts need to be ditched in favour of a new approach. I will also at least try to represent intelligent friends outside of science who get cross with me for arguing that scientific truths and evidence are patently the best way to navigate our way through topical controversies arguing that political ideas and values are just as valid.”,With Fiona Fox will be Evan Davis, BBC presenter, Newsnight anchor and author of
Post-Truth: Why We Have Reached Peak Bullshit
(Little Brown) he says;,“Too often in business and politics at the moment, people sign up to a belief not on the basis of evidence but instead because it fits their pre-existing world view. One hopes that science can resist this habit, but to do so scientists have to be aware of the all-too-human tendency we have to fit the facts to the belief, rather than the belief to the facts.”,,©  Little Brown                                                                                    © Evan Davies,Joining them is Matthew d’Ancona, columnist,
Science Museum Group
Trustee and author of
Post-Truth: The New War on Truth and How to Fight Back
(Ebury), who says:,“Post-Truth priorities have driven the rise of ‘scientific denialism'”: the growing conviction that scientists, in league with government and pharmaceutical corporations, are at war with the best interests of humanity. When truth falls in social value, the continuities in social practice it has supported are put in danger.”,,© Penguin Books
© Hay Festival,All journalists, the speakers know that alternative facts, half-truths that are designed to mislead and fake news have been grist to the mill of
politics
and journalism for centuries. Science itself has had many battles in recent decades over the truth of evolution and climate change, the safety of the MMR vaccine and so on.,The third speaker, James Ball, Special Correspondent for BuzzFeed UK, author of
Post-Truth: How Bullshit Conquered the World
(Biteback Publishing), adds:,“Science has been battling bullshit and misinformation long before any of us heard the words “fake news” or “post-truth”, whether it’s on climate change, dubious alternative therapies, or the anti-vaccination movement – but it’s not immune to the same pressures and biases that fuel the rest of the misinformation ecosystem. This evening should be a great chance for us to chat about what’s going right, what’s going wrong, and what we can do about the whole mess we’re in.”,,© Amazon                                                                      © The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists,The stakes seem much higher in the wake of the Brexit vote,
which shocked many scientists
, and Donald Trump’s elevation to US President. In 2014,
he tweeted
: “This very expensive GLOBAL WARMING bullshit has got to stop.”
Government still struggles with policy evaluation
, climate-warming gases are
not being properly recorded in official statistics
and some government officials are even being discouraged from using the term ‘climate change’.,There seems to be a global and political assault on fact. That is why more than 10,000 people, from researchers to celebrities, gathered outside the Science Museum earlier this year to join the
#MarchforScience
– a movement which began in Washington DC and spawned more than 600 marches worldwide.,Science is by no means perfect, of course. There is a ‘reproducibility crisis’ (see
Why Most Published Research Findings Are False
) and scientists can fool themselves and their peers in many ways: for example, there is data dredging (data fishing, data snooping, and p-hacking) which seeks patterns that can be presented as statistically significant, without a hypothesis about the underlying causality, and HARKing (which stands for Hypothesizing After the Results are Known), when it is claimed that a theory cooked up after an experiment was the point of the study in the first place.,Countermeasures are being discussed (registering details of experiments ahead of gathering data: insisting that studies are replicated
before they are published
; or
collaborations to double check findings
) and the scientific culture of scepticism, testing and provisional consensus-forming remains one of the most significant achievements of our species: just look at its ubiquitous and indisputable impact on everyday life through a wide range of technologies, from the world wide web to medical treatments.,We need to reemphasise science’s central role in society: the truth really is out there to be discovered and then acted upon. If democracy is to work, we need as many people as possible to understand what science offers in the post-truth era.,During the discussion, our distinguished speakers will grapple with the consequences of the rising influence of the web, where lies are given the same status as truth, the hypnotic appeal of false narratives and the role of citizens when it comes to seeking truth in public life. For a post-truth society, facing major challenges such as the spectre of climate change, science is more important than ever.,The
event
will allow our speakers to weigh up the current influence of the virtues that for centuries have guided that great intellectual journey that we call science: nullius in verba.,,Image from March for Science 2017,Science and the post-truth era

Leonardo da Vinci: the Mechanics of Genius
exhibition which opens here tomorrow (10 February to 4 September 2016), each host Museum has the opportunity to add a section of their own, giving the exhibition some local flavour.,So I searched the collections database to see what we have with a Leonardo connection. I wasn’t expecting oil paintings or crayon sketches but I did find an
intriguing set of nine models
made in 1952 and based on Leonardo’s drawings.,The models had been commissioned by the Museum from a model engineering workshop in Wimbledon. With help I tracked them down in the store and found an attractive group of carefully-made models, mostly in wood, in a deliberately unassuming style, as though considered appropriate to mechanical experiment. These were not imitations of objects that might be set before a Renaissance prince.,My next stop was the wonderful ‘Registry’ in the Museum, where thousands of files document all the doings of the staff in the era of paper records – schemes, memos, letters, drafts for letters, comments, reactions, all added sequentially to growing bundles in manila folders. Curators would add their comments and pass the file, in the internal mail, to the next recipient, so the record is full and rich. How a story such as the one I found in the relevant file might survive in the era of email is anyone’s guess.,This was the easiest piece of historical research I have ever done: I had only to turn the pages of the file and
a great story
unfolded.,In 1949 a fairly new and relatively junior curator, Keith Gilbert, working in ‘textile mechanics’, had a bright idea and he opened a file. He passed it to his ‘Keeper’ with a proposal for an exhibition in 1952 to mark the 500th anniversary of Leonardo’s birth, which included making models for display. This was an ambitious notion – a ‘special exhibition’, though common enough now, was not something the Science Museum did in the late 1940s. The other curators added unenthusiastic comments, with a range of excuses – no space was available, the workshop was too busy, and anyway, was
Leonardo
really a scientist?,Gilbert’s surprising response was to propose a much more ambitious project! Now I really sat up – a good story was emerging from the file. A much larger exhibition would be a collaboration between different institutions and be organised by a ‘representative committee’. The new Director,
Frank Sherwood Taylor
was tempted and approached the
British Museum
, who suggested contacting the
Royal Academy
.,For then on the project steamed ahead. Gilbert and Sherwood Taylor found themselves in a different world – one where ‘culture’ opened many doors, where expectations were high and imaginative proposals were welcome. The anxiety now was whether they could hold their own? Would the Museum’s contribution to the large exhibition live up to the occasion? Would science be swamped by art?,In fact the exhibition was a great success, including the gallery on science. The public flocked in, opening hours were extended and the period of the exhibition more than doubled. The
Royal Academy
made a sizeable profit and renovated their heating system with the proceeds. Their Director, the portrait painter
Sir Gerald Kelly
wrote to Sherwood Taylor when it was all over: ‘when next you have another such idea, please don’t hesitate to let us know!’,In fact it had all been Keith Gilbert’s idea, but he too had his moment in the limelight. A prestigious series of lectures was planned to accompany the exhibition and a speaker was sought for one on Leonardo the engineer. In the end it had to be admitted that Gilbert himself was the only person available who seemed to understand the subject and he had to join a lecture list with such cultural luminaries as
Kenneth Clark
,
Ernst Gombrich
and
Nikolaus Pevsner
.,It wasn’t all glamorous. Both Gilbert and Kelly also lectured to 800 industrial apprentices. On the mechanical side, Gilbert again was considered the only person up to the task, while Sir Gerald did his best to rise to the occasion in dealing with Leonardo’s art.
The Times
reported that he told the apprentices that Leonardo had ‘extraordinary eyesight … he would have made a great cricketer – probably bowling googlies, for he was a most ingenious man’.,You can read the full story in the Science Museum Group Journal

. Three of the models (pictured above) will be shown in London for our new Leonardo exhibition. They are small and modest in appearance, as befitted the limited resources available to the Science Museum in the period following the Second World War. In a slightly tongue-in-cheek allusion to this link to our situation today, the additional display has the title, ‘Leonardo for a Time of Austerity’.,Jim Bennett is Keeper Emeritus at the Science Museum.,Leonardo da Vinci: The Mechanics of Genius

Dambusters raid
. The 617 squadron, formed only two months earlier, had successfully destroyed two dams (Mohne and Eder), and damaged a third (Sorpe) using the ingenius invention of Barnes Wallis – a four tonne bouncing bomb.,Shortly before he died, Wallis donated
the bulk of his papers
to the
Science Museum
, including design notes, photographs, correspondence and reports relating to his work. We’ve picked out a few images below to tell the story of the bouncing bomb.,Even before the war begin, the UK Government had identified the three German dams as potential targets, but had no suitable weapons to launch an attack. Wallis’ idea is simple to explain, but was far more complex to put into action: bounce a 4 tonne rotating bomb across 400m of water until it hits the dam, sinks and explodes.,Bouncing bombs allowed Wallis to completely avoid the torpedo nets protecting the dam. However, to get the bounce just right, the Lancaster bombers needed to approach the dams flying just 20m above the water while traveling at 230mph (more on how this was done can be read
here
).,At exactly 389 metres from the dam wall – calculated by triangulating with the dam’s towers – the bombs were released. Wallis calculated that backspin would stabilise the bombs in ‘flight’, help create the bounce and forced the bomb to
cling to the face of the dam
once it sank.,Even with practice runs, it took many attempts to bounce the bombs correctly, and trials with live ammunition were only conducted
three days before the raids
. To this day, the skill and bravery of the 617 squadron (113 men in total), who flew low over enemy territory under the cover of darkness, remains breathtaking.,After the war, Wallis continued his work on aircraft design (before WWII he was a pioneer of geodetic design, used to build the largest airship of its time, the R100), designing “swing wing” aircraft suited to hypersonic flight.,Our Senior Keeper, Andrew Nahum, was interviewed about Barnes Wallis, his bouncing bomb and other work in 2013.

Ask anyone who has managed this condition for an extended amount of time and you will hear that the main challenges are not the multiple daily injections, or even the invasive blood testing, but the mental pressure to keep track of your blood sugars, treatments, medication calculations and the relentless effort to keep this never-ending juggling act going. After more than 22 years as a Type 1 Diabetic, I would agree with them!,The lack of accessible technology and actionable data is a common frustration among the Type 1 Diabetes community. With easier ways to get in
contact with other Diabetics
, members of the community have been able to chat and work together much more easily. In pure frustration, the community declared “We Are Not Waiting”.,,In 2015 I decided to use the supercomputer in my pocket – my smartphone – to assist with the management of my Diabetes.,With the community’s open source projects, namely
xDrip
and
OpenAPS
, I taught myself mobile development and built an Artificial Pancreas System (APS) app called
HAPP
. Diabetes affects the pancreas’s production of insulin, a hormone which regulates blood sugar levels. The APS can measure the amount of glucose in the blood and adjust how much insulin I need to inject to keep my blood glucose in the healthy range.,,There was no need to start from scratch or devise the best algorithm to crunch my data. I just looked at what the community had already developed and used that to kick-start my own project, allowing me to focus on building a system unique to my needs with the additional functionality that I required.,The system assisted with one of the most problematic areas of my care: me. The app is free from the frustration, impatience and, at times, the simple irrational thinking of a human. It does what I cannot – it analyses my data every five minutes and makes an unemotional, logical decision.,I moved from reactive management of my Diabetes to proactive, where the APS system would provide treatment alterations to manage the highs and lows of my blood sugars and at times stop these extremes from happening.,It is a liberating feeling, for the first time in 22 years I can let my Diabetes take a back seat without damaging my health.,,Where is this heading? Access to information, collaboration and cost of technology is only going to improve over time. As the community’s expertise improves we are going to start seeing more medical management challenges tackled by ordinary people: from analysing the wealth of information that we are capturing, using
high quality tools
made accessible by 3D printing; to spreading beyond the technically-capable 1% by sharing of knowledge at community workshops. This will spread beyond just the management of Diabetes to other conditions ripe for such
disruption
.,The community has proven to be a large, experienced and skilled resource that is currently underused. Its access to information, sharing of ideas and drive to improve quality of life will continue to
flourish
. Do these DIY projects really improve the management of our condition? Or is this just an effect of the patient being more active in their management? For me the outcome is the same, I am empowered by the community and the tools they have developed. We have a condition that we are managing now, and if you agree, or not, progress is not slowing, as We Are Not Waiting.,Beyond the Lab: The DIY Science Revolution

We started back in 2004 featuring the talents of Rufus Hound, Kat Nilsson, Brad Gross, Ben Samuels and myself. The line-up has changed over the years as has the format from more of a stand-up style, to a hybrid of stand up and the excellent science shows performed by the Science Museum’s brilliant Learning team.,But now, a new era is about to begin in Punk Science. With the immensely talented Dan Hope leaving to pursue his acting career we were faced with the unique challenge of finding someone who is both quite good at science communication and can be quite amusing at the same time. After an arduous selection process involving an assault course, a baking contest and a spelling test, it was Science Museum Explainer and comedian Sam Furniss who served up a particularly good millefeuille accompanied by an ability to spell millefeuille that lead to his selection.,What can you expect to see in the new era of Punk Science?,Some of the same stuff people liked from our extensive back catalogue along with the new game show featuring at Lates on the last Wednesday of every month. This is a new style of science show taking the conventional demonstrations based format and combining it with the competitive elements of a TV game show. The idea is to attract an adult audience who wouldn’t normally go to a science themed event by using main stream entertainment techniques. It’s the next generation of “The Generation Game”. For those of you, who aren’t familiar with “The Generation Game”, add it to the list of things to Google.,Tickets are available for the all new

Endurance
set sail from Plymouth, bound for Antarctica. The ship carried Sir Ernest Shackleton’s
Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition
, the goal of which was to make the first transcontinental crossing of Antarctica through the South Pole, from the Weddell Sea to the Ross Sea.,The expedition failed when
Endurance
became trapped in pack ice and, after 9 months, was eventually crushed and sank, stranding Shackleton and the crew on the ice. Despite this failure the trip became famous as an epic feat of endurance, as Shackleton and his crew made a desperate and heroic bid for escape in three tiny boats, crossing the Southern Ocean to the island of South Georgia. Sadly, three lives were still lost: Victor Hayward, Aeneas Mackintosh and the Rev. Arnold Spencer-Smith from the
Endurance’s
supply ship the
Aurora
.,It was the last great expedition of what is known as the heroic age of Antarctic exploration, and for 100 years has provided inspiration for both explorers and artists alike, including author Tony White whose thought provoking and innovative latest novel,
Shackleton’s Man Goes South

is the first novel ever to be published by the Science Museum. More information about Shackleton’s expedition and the novel, which is available as a free
e-book
until April 2015, can be found in the Science Museum’s

.,Drawing on tales of adventure from the past and cutting-edge new scientific research into the effects of climate change, White imagines a terrifying future where people are fleeing to Antarctica, instead of escaping from it; in a hot world instead of a cold one.,The author says that he became fascinated not only by Shackleton’s amazing feat of heroism, but the way that the story has been told. “I wondered what new resonances those early tales — and moving images — of Antarctica a century ago might have now when that great continent’s ice sheets are at risk because of climate change, and what kind of Shackleton myth might inspire future generations of migrants to Antarctica. Migration is being seen as a form of adaptation to climate change, and the novel suggests that climate change refugees, setting out in tiny boats on equally desperate and epic voyages, might be the Ernest Shackletons of our day.”,There are zeppelins over South Kensington and boat people in the South Atlantic. Among them are Emily and daughter Jenny, travelling south to safety and a reunion with John who has gone ahead to find work. They travel with Browning, a sailor who has already saved their lives more than once. In the slang of their post-melt world, Emily and Jenny are refugees known as ‘mangoes,’ a corruption of the saying ‘man go south’.,To find out more about the inspiration behind

London Passenger Transport Board
(an ancestor of
Transport for London
) might photograph one of his models for a ‘poster giving publicity to the Science Museum’.,Curiosity provoked, I searched google for an image of this poster (not realising at this stage the Science Museum have the original poster in its collection).,As it transpired, another, even more fetching, mathematical model had been chosen. Sadly the Museum no longer has this one, having returned it to University College London in 2015 after a whopping 139-year loan.,The artist commissioned for the work was none other than the well-known Yorkshire Modernist, Edward Wadsworth.,Wadworth originally studied engineering in Munich before switching to art at
The Slade
in London. He dabbled in several avant garde art movements of the time, such as
Futurism
and
Vorticicm
. During the First World War, Wadworth painted allied ships with
dazzle camouflage
. One of his most famous paintings, ‘Dazzle-ships in Drydock at Liverpool’, showed off this nautical look in stunning Voriticist style.,But the model was not the only thing that caught Wadsworth’s attention at the Science Museum. He also painted a model propeller from the Science Museum’s collection, which was the subject of another London Underground poster promoting the South Kensington museums.,The Science Museum also has Wadsworth’s
original painting
of the ship’s propeller – so prized, it once hung in the Director’s office!,The propeller was clearly an influence on Wadsworth’s later work. A series of detached, human-like propellers feature in his 1940 work, ‘
Bronze Ballet
’, a wonderful depiction of Le Harve harbour that is currently on display in the
Tate Britain
.,Like Wadsworth, the sculptor Henry Moore was also inspired by the Museum’s mathematics models. Writing in 1968, Moore revealed:,“Undoubtedly the source of my stringed figures was the Science Museum … I was fascinated by the mathematical models I saw there.”,Mathematics and the visual arts have long been close bedfellows. An equation drove Zaha Hadid’s beautiful design aesthetic of the Science Museum’s

.,Designing the Difference and Analytical engines was a monumental task, demanding dedication and extreme attention to detail. Both engines were made up of thousands of parts that required near identical manufacturing – pushing Victorian technology to its limits. And Babbage was determined to make the machines operate without any possibility of errors.,Babbage was very certain his engines would work. His passion for his machines kept him going despite numerous setbacks such as losing funding and the lack of acclaim or understanding of his inventions. Babbage continued designing engines until he died, absolutely sure that one day his work would be appreciated.,And he was right. Nearly 150 years after Babbage’s death, our modern technological society can fully appreciate his genius in inventing the Analytical engine – the machine that embodies all the major principles of our computers – and the potential it had to change society.,Babbage passionately believed in his inventions and the importance of science. This uncompromising certainty made him highly critical of those who didn’t live up to his high standards. He published a scornful, sarcastic attack against the unscientific practices of the
Royal Society
. It was so shocking that Babbage’s friend John Herschel told him he would have given him a ‘good slap in the face’ for writing it if he had been within reach.,Babbage acted according to his scientific principles and succeeded in alienating the Royal Society – which had previously persuaded the Government to fund the Difference Engine. Babbage tried demanding more money from the Prime Minister, failed and lost all hope of further support.,Babbage’s uncompromising personality contributed to his failure to build his machines. Yet it was his unswerving dedication to science that made him continue to work beyond hope of realisation and produce the engine plans you can see on show in the Science Museum’s Computing gallery."

The Elliott-NRDC 401 is one of the first electronic computers, developed in 1952 when machines of this type could span 4 metres in length and weigh over a ton.,Using wartime radar technology the Elliott 401 was considered experimental and as a prototype tested a number of new techniques in computing and mathematical statistics. Initially its inbuilt functions consisted of addition, subtraction and multiplication. There was no capability for text, therefore the results were purely numerical and had to be annotated by hand.,A computer is only as good as the people around it; the Elliott 401 owes much of its success to Douglas Rees, the manager of the machine or ‘computer’ who aided its users when it was operational. At this time the term computer was also given to the people who worked on the technology.,By 1955 a charge of £25 per hour was fixed in place for any users wishing employ Elliott’s functions.,After performing solidly for 12 years, in 1965 the Elliott was donated to the Science Museum.,Today we are still giving the Elliott 401 the same attention at the museum.,The computer will feature in
Mathematics: The Winton Gallery
, an exciting new gallery opening on 8 December 2016. However, we first need to clean and prepare it after 60 years’ worth of storage.,As a Collections Assistant in the Science Museum’s conservation team I was involved in cleaning the Elliott 401.,Standing at over 2 metres tall the Elliott is a cased metal structure with two console units attached. What I find interesting about this huge machine is its inner-workings; the interior mechanics resemble something so unlike computers today.,The Elliott demonstrates a distinct age in which computing was not only visually constructive but relied heavily on human interaction.,A team of eight people were involved in the cleaning of Elliott 401, including conservators and collections assistants.,We started the cleaning by using a brush and vacuum followed by a soft microfibre cloth to remove the exterior layers of dust. Inside the Elliott 401 sit hundreds of wires amongst connectors and sockets that allow a considerable amount of dirt to build up over time. We swabbed wire after wire using several techniques ideal for picking up residue and dust, including a small putty based material called Groom Stick, a natural vulcanized rubber called Smoke Sponge and a cotton swab coated in distilled water or Industrial Methylated Spirit.,After many hours of cleaning the Elliott-NRDC 401 is now ready to be installed in the new gallery.,Mathematics: The Winton Gallery

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/jarvik-7-an-artificial-heart/,Selina Hurley,Jarvik 7 – an artificial heart,"Curator Selina Hurley, and Sir Terence English, look at how we got from the first implanted artificial heart to where we are today.",Collections and Objects,"biology,innovation,medicine,technology","On 4 November 1986 a momentous operation took place for the first time in the UK. A person awaiting a heart transplant was running out of time, so the medical team, led by Sir Terence English, decided to implant an artificial heart, the Jarvik-7.,In the early 1980s an American physician named Robert Jarvik (b.1946) developed a plastic and Velcro pump that replicated the lower two chambers of the heart. It was ‘pumped’ by compressed air, and monitored by cumbersome 1980s computers.,Jarvik worked with, and was inspired by the work of, Willem Kolff (1911-2009). Kolff worked on a number of artificial organs, including a kidney dialysis machine which he developed during the Second World War, while in German-occupied Holland. He used  easily available resources such as cellophane sausage casing and empty food tins to build his ‘kidney’, which served to filter the blood. This example in our collection is made from an apricot tin.,In 1982, following the first successful implantation of the Jarvik heart into 61 year old dentist Barney Clarke, Jarvik requested to meet with Sir Terence English to see if the artificial organ could be used in Papworth Hospital’s NHS transplant programme. English consented, but only as a bridge to transplant, and he and his colleagues were trained for many months by Kolff and several members of Jarvik’s team. Funding for the training and the device including the computer console came from an American medical organisation, Humana .,Once everything was in place, the team at Papworth had a long wait for a suitable patient. The Jarvik 7 is a massive device, so they needed a patient with a large chest, and in 1986 a suitable person was admitted. Although in very ill health, while waiting for a donor heart, the patient and his wife both consented to the operation.,As with any new innovation in surgery, it was difficult to fully prepare those undergoing the operation for the potential risks involved. I’ve often thought about people who consent to procedures and operations which are happening for the first time, and the massive amount of trust they place in their surgeons, especially in the face of life-threatening conditions.,In his autobiography
Follow Your Star: From Mining to Heart Transplants – A Surgeon’s Story
English wrote:,“The operation went smoothly…and it was a fascinating experience to have such total mechanical control over the blood being pumped around the body.”,This type of operation is known as a ‘bridge to transplant’ operation, bridging the time until a heart becomes available for transplant. It’s not an implantable heart, but a circulatory support. The patient of that historic UK first operation improved, and had a human heart transplanted two days later. English admitted:,“It was a difficult decision, as I would have liked the patient to have benefited more before transplanting him. But I knew how difficult and unpredictable it was to obtain suitable donors and so I went ahead and we took the Jarvik heart out and put the human donor heart in. The patient did well but sadly died nearly 2 years later from an infection.”,English never used the Jarvik system again, as it was much too cumbersome, expensive and meant two massive operations for the patients.,Alongside the kit, we also are incredibly fortunate to have in our collection Terence English’s ‘Artificial Heart Protocols’ documents, used during his training sessions and subsequent operation at Papworth hospital.,The manual includes details about the operation, the roles of the surgical staff including the scrub nurses, post-operative care and also the set-up of the operating theatre.,In 1981, a Scientific American article by Robert Jarvik predicted that it would be a decade until artificial hearts are routinely implanted into humans. He acknowledged the limitations of the Jarvik 7; being tethered to large machines, being uncomfortable and a risk of infection where the pumps were attached into the chest.,Thirty years on from Jarvik’s prediction, the first person in the UK to receive a completely implanted
artificial heart
was also treated at Papworth. Matthew Green, carried a small shoulder bag which powered his life saving pump, known as a Total Artificial Heart, meaning he could leave his house for up to three hours at a time. Mr Green used this device for two years until he received a donor heart.,With thanks to Sir Terence English for his insight into this historic operation and the kind donation of the Jarvik 7 device.,Jarvik’s prototypes are currently on display at the
National Museum of American History
in Washington, D.C."

With civilian air travel expanding rapidly in the 1920s, aircraft manufacturers around the world needed a better understanding of the mathematics of aerodynamics and material stress.,This experimental aircraft, made in Britain by Handley Page and building on aerodynamic work carried out during WWI, was designed to take off and land slowly and steeply without stalling, vital at a time when urban airfields were often shrouded in fog.,Welcoming the £5 million donations, our Director Ian Blatchford described it as a “game-changing gift to the museum”.

Cédric Villani
, winner of the most prestigious prize in mathematics, the Fields Medal.,The Museum already plans to launch a £4 million platform for photography, art, and science, called Media Space this autumn; a £1 million immersive show about particle physics,
Collider
, in November; and a £16 million
Information Age
gallery in 2014, as the world’s foremost celebration of information and communication technologies.,Ian Blatchford, Director, announced at the annual dinner that the next major project would be to deliver a maths gallery on the second floor of the museum in 2016, quoting Churchill, who famously described how his Harrow master ‘convinced me that mathematics was not a hopeless bog of nonsense and that there were meanings and rhythms behind the comical hieroglyphics.’,The project will draw on the expertise of Jim Bennett, previously director of the Museum of the History of Science in Oxford, and the advice of some of the country’s best popularisers of mathematics,
Prof Marcus du Sautoy
and
Alex Bellos
.,Appropriately, the guest of honour and keynote speaker at the dinner was Cédric Villani, Director of the
Institut Henri Poincaré
(UPMC/CNRS) who was awarded the 2010 Fields Medal and is as well known for his ‘19th century poet’ look – white cravat and long hair– as his playful, inspirational approach to mathematics.,His lecture deftly intertwined physics, economics and geometry and he referred to the curse of mathematicians who, like in the legend of the Lady of Shallot is condemned ‘ to look at this world only through its reflection.”,Villani’s research (described in his TEDx talk above) is based on kinetic theory, which scientists use to describe a system of interacting particles such as a gas or liquid in which billions of molecules are moving in all directions.,He has extended this theory to include the long-range interactions between molecules, the
second law of thermodynamics
and the
Boltzmann equation
, which describes the behaviour of particles in a low density gas. He illustrated his talk with a picture of himself taken in the central cemetery, in Vienna, next to Ludwig Boltzmann’s grave. Because the second law of thermodynamics predicts that entropy – a measure of disorder within a system – always increases, Villani has in effect figured out was just how fast our world is falling apart.,Later in the evening, Lord Rees, the Astronomer Royal, was made a
Science Museum Fellow
in recognition of his contribution to the world of science.,The black tie event, which was addressed by the Chairman of Trustees, Dr Doug Gurr and sponsored by Champagne Bollinger, was attended by leading figures including Jim al-Khalili, broadcaster and physicist; Evan Davis, Presenter of Dragons’ Den and the Today programme; entrepreneur and model Lily Cole; Science Minister David Willetts MP; Imran Khan, CEO of the British Science Association; Anthony Geffen, CEO & Executive Producer of Atlantic Productions; Daisy Goodwin, television producer, poetry anthologist and novelist; Deborah Bull, Executive Director, King’s Cultural Institute; Simon Singh, author; Fiona Fox, Director of the Science Media Centre; Sarah Sands, Editor of the Evening Standard; and Professor of Genetics, Steve Jones."

exhibition
.,It looks like a kind of over-engineered Victorian executive toy: A semicircle of metal with carefully marked grooves and two long wooden arms with padded covers like two giant matchsticks. Curator Phil Loring and I are having a go at the
Fechner sound pendulum
that tried to measure the speed of thought, through timing the “just noticeable difference” heard in each arm hitting the base.,It’s incredibly complex to use and hard to see what useful data they would have obtained. But it is a fascinating example, like all of the exhibits in this new show, of the unique challenge of psychology through the ages and the huge efforts that have gone in over the centuries to quantify scientifically, physically, the hidden processes of our minds.,There’s a historical journey through human attempts to explain the mind’s makeup, searching for physical, not just mystical explanations. Medieval Europeans looked to the fluids of the body; the physical power of the four humours to explain character. You can imagine Chaucerian Englanders saying “He’s always really moody. That’s typical black bile, that is.” And it’s comparable to the strangely enduring hold in many cultures today of astrology.,The most dramatic displays are of the physical beauty of a 17th-century Italian nerve table. Here we see human nerve strands dissected, stretched out and varnished like an intricate bare-leafed tree as if in detangling the physical form, one might detangle the intricacy of psychology.,Going through the
Science Museum
’s storage vaults while making the introductory film (above) for this exhibition, I was struck by how rich the history of mind study is with physical objects. Particularly frogs. On show you’ll see anthropological curiosities like the amuletic dried frog in a silk bag from early 20th century south Devon (to cure fits).,And German scientist
Emil du Bois-Reymond’s
“frog pistol” in the 1860s. Frogs are certainly featured in the work of the 18th century Italian pioneer whose work forms the highlight of Mind Maps: equipment and sketches belonging to
Luigi Galvani
of Bologna – who gave his name to galvanism and has inspired everything Gothic and re-animated from
Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein
to
Douglas Trumbull’s
film
Brainstorm
.,Luigi Galvani
and his wife, Lucia, a trained anatomist, got through a lot of dead frogs as they explored the relationship between nerve activity and electricity. In an interesting link back to the medieval humours, Galvani saw electricity as a fluid. And as with the Fechner thought-measuring pendulum, you can feel the frustration embodied in Galvani’s sandglass that could measure fractions of an hour, but not the fractions of a second needed for the speed of nerve movements in his experiments.,Freud,
shellshock and modern psychiatric medicine are placed for the first time for me, in a scientific continuum: I see in this exhibition a tale within a tale – the story of human thinking stretching ambitiously beyond the technology of its time. The exhibition is the story of nothing less than the human quest to find the elusive quintessence of human existence: the soul and its torments.,Mind Maps: Stories from Psychology, a free exhibition exploring our understanding of the mind,
opens on Dec 10 and runs until August 2014. The exhibition is supported by the British Psychological Society (BPS).,For more of Samira’s writing follow her via

The Museum’s exhibitions in those days usually celebrated new technologies, such as television (in 1937) or showed unfamiliar parts of its collections, for example, ‘rafts, canoes and boats’ (1931). But noise was seen as a by-product of industrial modernity that needed to be tackled, not least by new silent technologies and measuring devices, and so the exhibition was planned.,To celebrate the 80
th
anniversary of this exhibition, and as part of the research towards a future exhibition on science, technology, and music, the museum has organised a series of events, organised around the themes of ‘Music, Noise and Silence’. The series, funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council, is being developed in conjunction with the
Royal College of Music
and the
University Nottingham
. Each workshop includes publicly-accessible concerts and talks by high profile speakers.,On February 25-26 at the
Royal College of Music
, we explore Music and Silence, starting from the idea that silence is the ‘absolute zero’ of both music and the science of acoustics. The conversations will discuss the proposition that modern ‘quiet’ music – including experimental, ambient and spiritual genres – are responses to industrial modernity.,The publicly-accessible concerts and talks for ‘Music and Silence’ features a two-part
concert
on 25th February and an afternoon of presentations by

This historical technology was then used to record a series of very modern beatbox performances with Jason testing his full vocal range to mimic instruments and create experimental sonic environments that were captured in the wax.,The success of a wax recording is affected by the quality of the wax and any invisible imperfections that it might hold, so there was great anticipation as the first recording was played back on an antique concert horn.  The effect was quite magical with the wax offering not so much a faithful reproduction of the performance but one that was layered and softened by the recording process.,The series continues with special guests:,Wednesday, 20 June 2012:

I’m one of the two new recruits on the Outreach and Resources team at the
Science Museum
. I’ve been in the team for two months now, and I’ve already had some amazing experiences!,The Outreach team’s job is to travel around the country, bringing explosive science shows and workshops to schools, communities and festivals. The Outreach team perform lots of different shows and workshops. Most of my time has been spent in training, learning to perform the shows. Here I am performing the Glorious Blood show for the very first time in a school. The flour shower experiment was very popular!,,On Mondays, the
Outreach team
plan their visits for the week. As well as figuring out how to get to the different schools, we also need to figure out what props we need to bring for our shows. Every Monday, the team goes to the Outreach storeroom to organise the show props for the week. We perform 22 different shows and workshops, so there are a lot of boxes in the storeroom.,,Once we’ve sorted out what we need, we load all the props into the Outreach van. Lifting the boxes can be tiring work, but I’ve been getting better at it every day. Sometimes fitting all the boxes into the van can be like a giant game of Tetris, but the oldies on the team make it look easy.,,When we’re not out visiting schools or communities, we’re in the office planning our visits, ringing up schools, or working on special projects. One of my projects is to update the Meet the Team section of our webpages. I’ll be taking photos of the team, asking them intriguing interview questions and putting their answers up on the website for all to see. Watch this space!,One of the best aspects of working in Outreach, aside from all the different shows I get to perform, is visiting new places. Occasionally the Outreach team go on away trips to exotic locations such as Ireland, Italy and Hong Kong. My favourite away trip to date has been the annual Outreach trip to Gibraltar. Our team performed shows and workshops for every school over the course of the week. I was surprised when I saw photos of myself and Laura performing the Not So Sleepy Hedgehog storytelling in the local newspaper on my second day!,,I’ve been learning something new every day on the Outreach team, and I’m having an absolute blast visiting people all around the world and showing them how fun science can be. Perhaps I’ll see you around in the New Year!,If you’d like the Science Museum’s outreach team to visit your school or event, details of what we offer and how to book can be found on our

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/fifty-years-of-human-heart-transplants/,Selina Hurley,Fifty years of human heart transplants,Curator Selina Hurley celebrates 50 years since the first successful human heart transplant.,"At the Museum,Exhibitions and Galleries","biology,medicine","Fifty years ago, at 6.13am (GMT) on 3 December 1967 at the Groote Schuur Hospital, Cape Town, history was made with the first successful human to human heart transplant.,South African surgeon, Christiaan Barnard stunned the world as news broke out that he had carried out the operation to place Denise Darvall’s heart into Louis Washkansky’s chest.,This news was ground-breaking and became forever embedded in the public consciousness.,Over the last couple of months, I have lost count of the conversations I’ve had with people, including my parents, about what it was like. Barnard’s achievement was so often compared to climbing Mount Everest.,Up until this point, kidney, liver, and lung transplants had been performed, but without the same media attention.,The heart was and is forever intertwined with ideas of love, emotion, and personality. There was also no backup plan if the heart transplant failed, so the operation was fraught with risk.,A quote that captures the intrepid pioneers of the sixties comes from Donald McRae’s book
Every Second Counts: The Race to Transplant the First Human Heart:,‘Even the idea of touching the human heart, let alone cutting it out and placing it inside another living body, had been considered impossible.’,Research into the procedure had been happening for years, notably by American surgeon Norman Shumway; a man who many thought would perform the operation first.,However,
Barnard remained adamant
that he owed nothing to Shumway.,To commemorate this historic milestone in medicine we are looking at human heart transplants then and now – told by the people who have that unique experience, accompanied by objects that support their stories today.,The first donor: Denise Darvall,‘If you can’t save my daughter, you must try and save this man.’ Edward Darvall,Twenty-five-year-old Denise Darvall had irreversible brain damage following a car accident. Her father made the decision to donate her heart in just four minutes.,Much of the technical expertise to do this operation had been developed years beforehand. What halted most surgeon’s efforts was finding a donor.,Many legal definitions of death were defined by the stopping of the heart and in South Africa, two doctors had to agree. Barnard used a simple definition of what we now know as ‘brain death’– no reaction to light or pain, including an examination by a neurosurgeon.,However, he still faced opposition in his own surgical team. So, they waited for her heart to stop beating before removing it.,The first recipient: Louis Washkansky,‘I was petrified at what I’d find. Like everyone else I thought the heart controls all your emotions and your personality.’ – Louis Washkansky,Louis Washkansky had heart failure following three heart attacks. When approached by Barnard about the risky surgery he replied: ‘I can’t go on living like this.’,Following his transplant, newspapers reported on his condition daily. Even the ECG of Louis’s new heart starting up was headline news. Unfortunately, he died 18 days later from pneumonia because his immune system had been extremely weakened.,The first surgeon:
Christaan Barnard,Barnard’s historic operation kicked off what became known as ‘a year of transplants’ where surgeons attempted the same operation. Over 100 operations happened in 50 different hospitals worldwide with varying degrees of success. Although, high mortality rates and the high cost meant many surgeons turned their back on the procedure.,By the end of the 1970s, with brain death passing into law and new immunosuppressant drugs, transplants became more widely practiced again.,Barnard’s own transplant record is impressive reading: his second patient, dentist Philip Bleiberg lived for 18 months; another Dorothy Fisher lived for 12 years and Dirk Van Zyl lived for 23 years. All the more incredible when some of the widely used immunosuppressants only came in to use years after their operations.,Heart transplants today,Today over 200 heart transplants happen each year in the UK without the media fanfare but forever change the lives of the people who receive them. I have been lucky enough to talk to people involved in heart transplants with the help and support of Papworth Hospital – one of five transplant centres in the UK.,Heart surgeon, Catherine Sudsharan says:,‘The heart is such a fascinating organ that it never seizes to amaze me. Technically, it may be one of the easiest operations that I perform. But, the fact that this beautiful organ that belonged to one individual, removed and then plumbed into another person, starts to beat and subsequently works within minutes of completing the operation irrespective of class, race, age or sex continues to enthuse me.’,Meeting Eric Scoones, who had a heart transplant in 2013, was one of the most memorable days I have had during my time at the Science Museum.,His openness about his story was moving and the objects on display tell just a small part of that story –  a month’s worth of medication boxes taken to stop his body rejecting his new heart and the t-shirt he wears while running to inspire others to think about becoming an organ donor.,Unlike the first human heart transplant, Eric will never know who his donor was as all donations in the UK are anonymous, but he often thinks of them:,‘
At first, I actually couldn’t sleep because my new heart felt like it was beating so hard! I often remind myself of the precious gift that I’ve received, thanks to my anonymous donor and the generous spirit of his family at a time of tragedy for them.’,You can see the free display

Outreach team
was invited for the second time by The British Council in Hong Kong to deliver a series of shows and workshops as part of their
Science Alive Festival
. The theme of this year’s festival was ‘The Code of Life’ and we disgusted audiences with blood, guts, and snot, exploring the science behind the
human digestive system
,
blood
, and
materials
. We spent three days with our hosts at the
Hong Kong Science Museum
and a further nine days visiting twenty-two schools across Hong Kong and New Territories. We experienced many different educational settings from government-funded local schools to private international schools reached a combined audience of over 7,000!,Proving that no distance is too great for the Outreach team, we then caught a train to Dongguan City in mainland China to deliver events hosted by The Dongguan Science & Technology Museum. Over the course of four days, we engaged with audiences at the museum and two local schools, reaching over 3,000 people. This visit continued our relationship with the museum, having hosted a number of free science shows performed by their staff right here in London, in the Science Museum, back in September 2013.,During our busy schedule, we found time to sample some of the interesting local cuisines, tour both museums and see some local sites, the highlight of which was taking a cable car to see Hong Kong’s famous giant Tian Tian Buddha."
https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/8-things-about-your-body-clock/,Connie Orbach,8 things about your body clock,"Your body's chronotype is the internal clock that tells you when to eat, sleep, wake, work and more. Here are 8 eye-opening tips to help you keep it ticking over nicely.",At the Museum,,",Your body can only adapt to small changes in your sleep-wake cycle, so even the occasional late night can make you feel jet-lagged and throw your body out of sync. Try to go to bed at the same time every night and keep a regular routine.,Modern LED street lights are better for the environment than old-style sodium ones, but the American Medical Association warns that the bright white light they emit can confuse our bodies into thinking it’s daytime when it’s really night. Invest in heavy, light-excluding blinds for your bedroom to reduce this potential health risk.,,Every day, your body clock drives a 24-hour cycle of biological events called the circadian rhythm. The circadian hormone melatonin signals when it’s night-time and therefore time to sleep. Drinking coffee at night delays the release of melatonin into your system and fools your body into thinking that night-time won’t arrive until later.,In turn, the release of melatonin rolls over into the following day, which makes it difficult to get out of bed when it’s time to do so. A double espresso in the evening delays your clock by around 40 minutes. According to a study from the University of Colorado Boulder and the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, you would have to get up that much later the following morning to feel awake.,,Circadian lighting mimics Earth’s 24-hour daylight cycle and has the potential to elevate human health, mood and performance. The inhabitants of the International Space Station witness 16 sunsets every 24 hours, so circadian lighting is presently being tested there in an attempt to keep the astronauts in peak condition. Soon we may be installing these lights in our homes and offices too.,Shift work is associated with a host of health impacts and is the surest way to disrupt the circadian rhythm. According to a 2016 report by the Trade Unions Congress, one in eight of Britain’s workers work at night and that number is increasing. We can’t ban shift working but we can minimise its disruptive effects by planning shifts with circadian rhythms in mind and enabling people to keep their sleeping patterns as regular as possible.,,Your body clock’s main external stimulus is light, and exposing it to light at the wrong time disturbs its balance. Today’s electric lights are brighter, whiter and more numerous than the mellower, yellower lights of the past. Light emitted by phone and computer screens is in the blue wavelength, which is more disruptive than light in the yellow wavelength. Reducing your exposure to screens at night can significantly reduce its negative effects.,Many stimuli play important roles in keeping our chronotypes in sync. Among them are the times at which eat. These are key external cues for our metabolism, which anticipates that we will eat during our active daytime hours and fast at night. Irregular mealtimes or night eating can confuse these signals and befuddle our body clocks, so it’s important to eat at regular and expected intervals.,﻿,Are you a lark or an owl? That is: are you good to go to bed and get up early, or do you love late bedtimes and lie-ins? The place on the spectrum where you perceive yourself to be is the factor that defines your chronotype.,If you’re in your late teens or early twenties you’re much more likely to be an owl. But don’t beat yourself up if you find it a struggle to wake up in the mornings—it might not be because your body clock’s disrupted, but simply that your personal chronotype doesn’t fit into the overarching schedule that society imposes on us."
https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/did-you-knowseven-secrets-of-the-worlds-biggest-sleep-study/,Roger Highfield,Did you know…seven secrets of the world’s biggest sleep study,Preliminary insights from a pioneering global study of the impact of sleep on our ability to reason and think were revealed recently at a special event in Manchester.,At the Museum,,"Prof Adrian Owen and I discussed his new book,
Into the Grey Zone
, in which he describes his research over two decades on patients trapped in the twilight zone of consciousness, between awareness and death.,A huge online study of sleep, an everyday example of this twilight zone, was launched earlier this year his team at the University of Western Ontario, using the website
worldslargestsleepstudy.com
.,More than 100,000 people have already taken part and we discussed the first analysis by his team at the latest Manchester Science Festival, in an
event in the Museum of Science and Industry
.,Data are still pouring in from the study but his colleagues have already sifted online cognitive tests performed by the first 20,000 respondents, who reported on their sleep patterns and lifestyle by answering 30 questions. Here are seven preliminary insights to emerge from his work:,What is the optimum amount of sleep?,The optimal amount of sleep seems to be between 7-8 hours. ‘I don’t think people will be surprised by the main finding which is that your cognition is absolutely at its best with between seven and eight hours of sleep,’ he said. “That is about right. There is something in that old saying about eight hours of sleep being the right amount.’,I asked the jet-lagged professor, what effect does sleep deprivation have?,‘A large number of people (several thousand), more than you think, reported getting between four and five hours of sleep,’ said Prof Owen. The team compared these people with those who claimed to get 8 hours and the 4-hour sleepers were worse ‘on every single cognitive test’ – when it came to cognitive skills, they were ‘significantly poorer.’,The difference in performance between people who slept four hours and those who slept the optimal amount is 0.34 standard deviations, or equivalent to about 5 IQ points being ‘knocked off’, he said. This is akin to ‘having a couple of drinks’. So far, sleep seems to affect performance on all tests equally, so a poor night’s sleep translates into a poor performance.,Do we understand the link between sleep deprivation and poor performance?,In a
recent study
on 27 sleeping people, Prof Owen and his colleagues used a method called EEG to study electrical activity in the brain and revealed a link to what are called spindles, bursts of activity in a deep structure called the thalamus,  which plays a central role in memory, attention, perception, awareness, thought, language, and consciousness.,Earlier studies have linked spindles with IQ. “In fact, spindles are the only biological marker of intelligence’, he said, explaining how he finds it remarkable that they can be used to predict how well you do, when wide awake, on a decision-making task.,The new work by his lab connects these ‘squiggles’ of electrical activity during light sleep with reasoning abilities. “We have identified the brain circuits – those linked with higher cognitive functions that were time-locked to spindles that are correlated to cognitive abilities,” he said. So, it seems sleep deprivation may interfere with spindles, ‘damaging our reasoning ability.”,Can you have too much sleep?,Yes. Prof Owen’s huge survey reveals that too much sleep also seems to be associated with poorer cognitive performance. People who got more than 8.8 hours of sleep also tended to do worse at the tests. ‘Too much sleep can also be bad for you.’ However, the effects were not as large as those who were sleep deprived.,Is age a factor in how much you need?,Though early days, the 7-8 hour recommended amount of sleep remains the same, even though the amount of sleep changes over a normal lifespan. ‘It is still the people who get seven to eight hours who do the best,’ he said.,Has your sleep study shed light on other aspects of intelligence?,Some more general insights into cognition have emerged. Many scientists believe that if you learn a second language, particularly as a child, it will ‘somehow make you smarter,’ he said. Data on 5000 or so people who could speak two languages suggested they are no different from those who only speak one. ‘That’s not to say there aren’t advantages to speaking two languages, but it doesn’t make you smarter.’,What is sleep?,Sleep marks a shift in consciousness, explains Prof Owen. ‘When you go to sleep at night, there are some parts of your brain that continue to process information around you, just as if you are awake, and other parts of your brain which shut down and don’t process that at all – it is a change of the level of your consciouness.’,Sleep is as vital for life as food or water. Lab rats deprived of sleep die within a month, and too little affects your immune system and appetite, is linked to heart disease, obesity, and diabetes. Increasingly, a lack of sleep is implicated in mental health problems including bipolar disorder, depression and schizophrenia, even Alzheimer’s,During the event, we also discussed the
world’s largest intelligence test
and the subject of his book,  research that Prof Owen began in Cambridge two decades ago, notably at the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit,
using brain scans to investigate patients who are trapped in the grey zone
between life and death.,Because of the rise in recent decades of resuscitation and emergency medicine, which can save the lives of severely-brain damaged patients, tens of thousands of people around the world now inhabit the grey zone.,,A recording of the event can be heard here"

Like a shrouded voice from gossamer prints of the 19th century blurring into focus,
Illuminating India’s
opening room is an unearthing of overlapping voices, undetected stories and mired histories, given fresh lease, arising from the earliest days of photography in the subcontinent. It’s rise and transition is punctuated here through freewheeling associations, which chart an alternative arc – sites and the inhabitants claiming equal ground in the display, positioning the viewer
en medias res
– a point from which to enter both past and present perspectives while also observing the transformation of photo-processes and practices over time. On the occasion of India’s 70th anniversary as an independent nation, such a venture comments on the medium’s restless gait and abundance, its rise to occasion, challenges and assimilations over time.,The curatorial effort to ascertain works of local practitioners from the 19th century is a conscious departure from most previous thematic constellations, which have thus far usually privileged the output of itinerant European photographers. The general intent was to highlight practices of portraiture, landscape and survey imagery, which speak of a dialogue
about
India as a shared space of mutuality, with voices on both sides clashing and claiming their place – from the colonial to the present. My involvement with the exhibition as Consulting Curator, was then to convey shifts or gaps in the projected history and Orientalist ideology, with aspects that interplayed with the contemporary – whether in terms of media strategy or social relevance. With the hand-painted photograph for instance, it was to scrutinize historical or generational continuity in regional art traditions, hybrid forms as bold gestures of self-expression, while works of performative/self-portraiture (Ram Singh II, Shahpoor N. Bhedwar, Umrao Singh Sher-Gil etc.) could problematize the contemporaneity of current practices by volunteering historical samples that can be regarded as social breakthroughs even today.,Ahmed Ali Khan (active c. 1850-1862) or
Chote Miyan
(‘Little Master’) in the court of Wajid Ali Shah from Lucknow, represents the early camera work in the midst of a strong courtly culture. Identified as one of India’s first recognized practitioners, documenting one of the earliest female courtesans, Nawab Raj Begum Sahiba, staring causally into the lens, his work suggests how place, privilege and access were crucial variables in representation –
who
was producing and for
whom
. As a result, the timeline of the exhibition, 1857-2017, broadcasts discussions on the convivial space of the studio, as well as aspects of coercion, one in which people were persecuted, and even typified as objects of science. And here perhaps the setting of the exhibition at the Science Museum is a potent reminder of postcolonial scholarship around ‘viewing’, given colonial photographs were originally stored here as objects of study, which will now move across to join the colonial and modern photo-collections of the V&A.,The works of William Johnson (active c. 1852-1865) and Vidal Portman (c.1860-1935), both of whom function as veiled anthropologists, express an imperial gaze, closely documenting what were then termed as ‘primitive’ tribes, as well as castes and races, marking ongoing concerns about how naming or denying agency to marginalized communities in the present, can be traced to such visual antecedents. They provide, at times, an eerily playful (photo-montaged people and backdrops), yet searing commentary on heated discussions and activism, which involve the
adivasi
and
dalit
communities – the overt and subtle coercion of the disenfranchised subject. And by bringing in Vidal’s work from the Andamans, the exhibition also intimates an India beyond its immediate borders, alluding to a larger S. Asian geography for photography, which may yet be explored in another exhibition (or in continuation to the Whitechapel Gallery show in 2010,
Where Three Dreams Cross
).,The exhibition however forcefully conveys that the history of photography in India is gradually being unearthed and hence requires constant revision – not as a survey of what exists (which is impossible) but samples which highlight a shifting focus and insinuate broader fields of investigation. Its developments are not only linear, and hence the interest in schools and styles of depiction are also focused on. Though we do not see early Indian women photographers from India (from Bengal for instance), the newly discovered, evocative works of Helen Messinger Murdoch (1862-1956), are an intriguing example of a woman photographer in India at the turn of the century, experimenting with the Autochrome colour process which predates the Kodachrome technique that became popular in the 1930s. The only ones we have seen of late,from India are those from the Albert Kahn collection in France, or others shot by Umrao Singh Sher-Gil (1870-1954), some of whose reproduced, portrait images are also on view.,Room after room, decade after decade, the exhibition deploys time as a sequencing tool, and we see how technology catalyzes and makes possible the imagistic rendering of new ideas, themes and visualizations. In conjunction with some rare images leading to the post-independence photojournalism of Sunil Janah (1918-2012), Henri Cartier-Bresson (1908-2004) and Homai Vyarawalla (1913-2012), there is a parallel depiction of notions of ‘modernity’ in other forms such as architecture, looking once again at both Indian and European practitioners – the brick and mortar exultation’s captured by Lucien Hervé (1910-2007), Werner Bischof (1916-1954) and later Madan Mahatta (c.1932-2014). They open out discussions invoking the cultural impact of India on Europe and the impressive international collaborations between practitioners in different fields – be it the study of Hindu temples by Swiss photographer Raymond Bernier (1912-1968) for scholar/curator Stella Kramrisch; or the photographed exhibitions of Bauhaus and German Expressionist luminaries held in India; or the path-breaking work of cinematographer Josef Wirsching (1903-1967) for Bombay Talkies; or the imaging of Indian fashion through the lens of Cecil Beaton (1904-1980).,The complicated terms of location and identity explored in the space-age imagery of Hervé, and his oblique monotone views, cropped frames and abstract compositions, are countered by the bright dynamic colour photography of Mitch Epstein, for instance, who depicts the existential ironies and epiphanies of ‘ordinary’ Indian life. These latter works illuminating public space and the collective experience point towards one of the two trajectories of realism that developed post-Independence: the photojournalism of practitioners such as Raghu Rai and the more personalized, interiorized image spectra of practitioners, such as Ketaki Sheth, Dayanita Singh and Pablo Bartholomew.,Nationality and nationalisms apart, we come to the contemporary field, where questions of gender, sexuality, personal history and also historical appropriation come into focus as ways of exploring the web of connections one makes with one’s surroundings. Sohrab Hura (Indian), Vasantha Yogananthan (French) and Olivia Arthur (English) are exhibited here scrutinizing broader aspects of mobility and exchange, as well as of transfer, relocation and exile.,Here the exhibition, plausibly and quietly subverts its own title cause by illuminating uncertainties about questions of belonging, representation and agency as well as tracing the infinite connections that may exist in a globalized world where relationships can be fleeting, immediate, intermittent or even ruptured. And perhaps here the exhibition shifts from assertions about image-making to propositions and investigations of spaces that may be private, wherein the individual tells a tale through photography’s poetic potential, suggesting that India’s place in photography’s world is one begging to be retold.,A
symposium
organised at the Science Museum on the question of ‘place’ and photography suggested some avenues of enquiry. One possible way of devising new dialogues in the future is by continuing to draw aesthetic lines of force back to one’s origins and re-calibrating those into new dimensions – the shaping of a revisionist cartography not merely through a redeployment of traditional imaging of the ‘home-grown’, but through skillful application of new technologies and new media forms that provoke the emergence of new testimonies of oneself and one’s ‘other/s’.,,Illuminating India: Photography 1857-2017
is part of the Science Museum’s Illuminating India season, which also comprises
Illuminating India: 5000 Years of Science and Innovation
and a series of events. Both exhibitions will run until 31 March 2018."
https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/why-the-double-helix-is-still-relevant/,Roger Highfield,Why The Double Helix is still relevant,"Half a century after the publication of The Double Helix, Roger Highfield looks at why the book is still relevant today.","At the Museum,Collections and Objects","biology,chemistry,dna,physics","Fifty years after publication shockwaves are still being sent out by Jim Watson’s notorious first-hand account of ‘perhaps the most famous event in biology since Darwin’s book’.,One of the greatest nonfiction books, his memoir provides candid insights into one of the most momentous discoveries of the 20th century, also revealing the scientific quest for the truth as being subjective and messy, a knotty combination of both the collegiate and competitive.,Watson’s braggart book, published in February 1968, underlines how the process of science is challenged by human foibles, an unsettling message that has even more resonance today as research undergoes a replication crisis, with the realisation that the findings of many scientific studies are difficult if not impossible to reproduce.
The title refers to their momentous discovery in 1953 of the structure of the molecule in our cells that forms our genes, a twisting pair of strands of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that has been unravelling to replicate itself since the dawn of life some four billion years ago.,They had ushered in a new era of molecular biology, with an insight that was profound. When they had deduced DNA’s double helix structure, Watson describes how his equally insufferable partner Francis Crick declared in the Eagle pub, where the two lunched in Cambridge, that, ‘we had found the secret of life’ (though at a recent celebration of Crick’s life at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, CSHL (where, in tribute, an Eagle pub sign now hangs), Watson admitted that
he had made this up for dramatic effect
).,I met Watson a few days ago in New York, along with other authors such as Martin Amis, Helen Fisher, Sidhartha Mukherjee, Amy Harmon, Steve Pinker and Simon Winchester, for a celebration of the 50th anniversary of The Double Helix, and to discuss its impact.
We gathered in the smart six-storey brownstone home of author Andrew Solomon, where the CSHL archivist Mila Pollock showed us the first editions of the book, along with extracts that appeared in The Atlantic. There was an introduction to The Double Helix by the writer Jonathan Weiner and a tribute from Nobel prizewinning neuroscientist Eric Kandel, who praised Watson’s early textbook The Molecular Biology of the Gene as being the ‘best of its kind’ in its day.,Watson told the throng that it was ‘very easy’ and ‘fun’ to write the 30 urgent chapters of The Double Helix, each taking him around a week, and its success was in part down to describing ‘one of the great moments in science.’,He wrote the book after he shared the Nobel Prize in 1962, with Crick and Maurice Wilkins of King’s College London (older than Watson, both died in 2004). I asked him – had the prize had emboldened him to be candid? ‘No’, was the firm response, though Alex Gann (co-author with Jan Witkowski of The Annotated and Illustrated Double Helix) pointed out that without the prize it was unlikely that the book would have been published.,Watson describes how they raced to beat their great American rival, Linus Pauling. At the outset, he writes: ‘Chiefly it was a matter of five people: Maurice Wilkins, Rosalind Franklin, Linus Pauling, Francis Crick and me’. One of the great strengths of his book is how, as he tells their intertwined story, much science is unobtrusively discussed.,In his foreword to Watson’s nonfiction novel, the Nobelist Sir Lawrence Bragg said he did not know of any other instance ‘where one is able to share so intimately in the researcher’s struggles and doubts and final triumph’.,What added to its novelty was that this account of happenings in the buttoned-up Britain of the 1950s was from the viewpoint of a 24-year-old cocksure Chicagoan who was as obsessed with parties and popsies as he was with science.,Bragg praises Watson’s ‘freshness and directness’, a reference to such gems as ‘a goodly number of scientists are not only narrow-minded and dull, but also just stupid’, or his blunt declarations about Crick (“Already for thirty-five years he had not stopped talking and almost nothing of fundamental value had emerged”) or the revelation that, when it came to Bragg, ‘Crick made his ears buzz.’,Bragg puts it all down to Watson’s ‘Pepys-like frankness’ but, Pepys was candid because he wrote his diaries as a purely personal record, and in shorthand for good measure, while Watson wanted to give the world an insider’s view of the race to reveal the double helix.,Opposition to publication
The publication of Watson’s raffish account was bitterly opposed by both Crick (‘far too much gossip’) and Wilkins, who complained to Watson that it shows ‘Francis as a feather brained hyperthyroid, me an overgentlemanly mug, and you an immature exhibitionist’…. Nor do I want to stand on one side while Rosalind is discredited’. Wilkins was bewildered by Watson’s depiction of his colleague Franklin as a ‘mean and priggish bluestocking.’ (Though perhaps he should not have been surprised – Watson gleefully told me that ‘I sort of traumatised Wilkins by my enthusiasm.’),Harvard University Press dropped the book, which was picked up by a newly-established commercial publisher called Atheneum. Concerns about libel only calmed when Bragg agreed to do the foreword, giving it credence. Even though Crick had complained ‘Who could possibly want to read stuff like this?’, the book was an immediate bestseller, shifting more than a million copies.,Crick would come to accept that Watson had written something special, which showed the complex way theories become ‘fact’, even if it did begin with: ‘I have never seen Francis Crick in a modest mood.’ (Watson told the 50th celebration that he had even toyed with calling his book
Base Pairs
‘as a joke to annoy Francis’).,In retaliation, Crick quipped that he had thought of writing his own account, provisionally entitled ‘The Loose Screw’ and starting out with: ‘Jim was always clumsy with his hands. One had only to see him peel an orange.’,When I talked to Wilkins in 2003, he acknowledged that The Double Helix was pioneering for the vivid insight it gave into the personalities and process of science. He bore no malice towards Watson and Crick, whom he had called ‘a couple of old rogues’. But he did have one regret.,Wilkins had declined when they had had invited him to co-author the
Nature
letter that unveiled the double helix in April 1953. He reasoned that he had not helped them build their now famous model of DNA (you can

in the Science Museum, which contains pieces of the original) but he subsequently realised that co-authorship would have emphasised the crucial cooperation between Crick and Watson in Cambridge with the team at King’s.,The controversy lives on
Today The Double Helix remains controversial for Watson’s musings on the opposite sex (‘The thought could not be avoided that the best home for a feminist was in another person’s lab’…. ‘the presence of popsies does not inevitably lead to a scientific future.’) and for his portrayal of ‘Rosy’, the King’s College chemist whose work, unknown to her, was revealed to Watson and Crick by Wilkins: (note that the nickname ‘Rosy’ was not dreamt up by Watson but by her colleagues at King’s).,Watson’s book provides a vivid glimpse of the antediluvian attitudes of the day: ‘She was not unattractive and might have been quite stunning had she taken even a mild interest in clothes. This she did not’ writes Watson in one passage. And in another: ‘I wondered how she would look if she took off her glasses and did something novel with her hair.’,Watson and Crick were swept along in their efforts to crack biology’s deepest mystery by a creative convergence of their work in Cambridge with that in London, and of research in two fields of science: chemistry, notably by playing with toy-like models of the shape of molecules, and physics, which furnished a way to reveal the structure of complex molecules with X rays, a technique that Bragg had pioneered four decades earlier.,There were many ingredients of success: the three laureates had been inspired by What Is Life? The Physical Aspect of the Living Cell, a 1944 book by physicist Erwin Schrödinger. Watson and Crick were spurred on by their rivalry with Pauling. The molecular structures for their models were corrected one Thursday by quantum chemist Jerry Donohue, who shared an office with them. (That insight provided the ‘key,’ Watson told me, for building one turn of the double helix the following Saturday on a table in the middle of their office.) And they had access to the X-ray data from King’s.,There Wilkins had been on to the idea of helices since 1951 but his boss John Randall had soured Wilkins’s relationship with Franklin (Randall had implied in a letter to her that DNA would be her project alone), and she was both uninterested in building models and dismissive of the idea of a helix. As Watson recalled, ‘She became increasingly annoyed with my recurring references to helical structures.’,Her data, which she did not directly share, would prove vital, as he put it (Watson recalled her photograph 51 was a revelation, because it “was so perfect”), and she provided insights into the relationship between the bases (the chemical ‘letters’ of the code) and the supporting structure of phosphate groups. Initially, late in 1951, they got the structure inside out (‘pure crap’, as Watson trenchantly put it to me) and ‘Rosy had hit it right in wanting the bases in the centre and the backbone outside’. Even so, persiflage proved irresistible to Watson: ‘her past uncompromising statements on this matter thus reflected first rate science, not the outpourings of a misguided feminist’.,But the relatively recent vogue for crediting Franklin with the most important part of the discovery has gone too far, Crick remarked the year before he died. Franklin, who was close to Crick, especially during her last illness, had never complained that she deserved more credit. But, of course, she never realised the extent to which the Cambridge duo had relied on her data.,Despite his attitude towards Franklin, Watson does not portray her as a passive victim: Franklin ‘got positively aggressive’ … ‘displayed increasing irritation’…. and ’fierce annoyance’ Indeed, Wilkins found that she could be terrifying. But when they eventually cracked the structure in 1953, Watson reports how she ‘accepted the fact that the structure was too pretty not to be true’. By the start of that year she too had come around to the idea of helices, after being, at best, unconvinced, at worst, hostile to the idea.,Franklin died of cancer in 1958 but if she had been alive when the Nobel committee had deliberated about the prize, which can only go to a maximum of three people, Watson said ‘it would have produced an ‘awkward if not insolvable dilemma.’,The implications of the double helix were profound. Watson was nervous about discussing them and it was Crick who came up with the payoff of their letter to the journal
Nature
: ’It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material.’ By splitting the base pairs of the double helix apart, and using each DNA strand as a template for building a new strand, DNA could replicate itself, along with its genes.,Thus, by revealing the structure they had shown how biological information is transmitted down the generations. Watson recounted his initial reaction when he saw the double helix that fateful Saturday: ‘I’m going to be famous.’ He felt a Nobel prize would inevitably follow, though it would take a year for another reference to the double helix to appear in
Nature
and nine years in all for the prize to eventually materialise.,Beyond the Double Helix
Watson did not rest on his laurels. He decided to leave Cambridge, despite its huge influence on biology at that time. “Francis being such a dominant person, I had to. My own career demanded I separate from Francis. ‘,Watson moved to Harvard University where his laboratory made many early contributions to molecular biology including, along with a group led by Sydney Brenner, the discovery of messenger RNA that mediates the transfer of genetic information from DNA to the cell.,Watson would become an intellectual impresario, turning Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on the East Coast of America into one of the world’s principal centres of biology, focusing on cancer genetics, where around 1150 people now work. He led the effort to read the entire human genetic code, which he began to consider in 1966, and on the way, he has courted much controversy, for instance making provocative comments on intelligence (always a fraught issue), declaring that the research on mice of Judah Folkman at Harvard Medical School would cure cancer within two years, or advocating genetic enhancement: ‘All parents want the best for their kids’.,The double helix has stood the test of time. That is not the case for a surprising amount of research. In 2005, John Ioannidis, Professor at Stanford University, stunned his peers with a study bluntly entitled
Why Most Published Research Findings Are False.
A decade later, it was reported that
more than half of psychology studies could not be reproduced
and, last year, Ioannidis concluded that cognitive neuroscience was in an even worse state than psychology. Efforts to reproduce the findings of many papers have
proved problematic
.,That is why, half a century on, The Double Helix remains required reading. If it has revealed anything about the process of research, it is that the motor that drives many scientists on is much more than simply a cold-eyed, logical quest to sate their curiosity with the truth. Science is also propelled by a hot-blooded urge to do absolutely anything to be first.,Sources

William Henry Perkin
was born. To commemorate this anniversary,
Sophie Waring
, our Curator of Chemistry, looks at items in the collections linked to his most famous invention: mauveine, the first synthetic organic chemical dye.,If you were an average person in the 1850s your wardrobe would have been made up of many shades of beige and browns. Fabric dyes were derived from plants and insects and expensive to make. Colourful wardrobes were a significant symbol of wealth; in particular purples were the often used in the garments of popes and monarchs.,In 1853 the young chemist
William Perkin
entered the
Royal College of Chemistry
, now part of Imperial College London, as a student supervised by
August Wilhelm Hofmann
. A year later, at only sixteen years old, Perkin assembled a laboratory at his home on Cable Street in east London where he started independent research. Perkin sometimes collaborated with
Arthur H. Church
, a talented painter who was interested in the chemistry of paint.,By 1856 Perkin had become Hofmann’s assistant and Hoffmann challenged him to synthesize
quinine
, an expensive natural substance much in demand for the treatment of malaria. Perkin started by reacting a salt of allyltoluidine with potassium dichromate.,The experiment failed. Repeating his method but trying different a salt, aniline, Perkin’s obtained a purple solution while cleaning out the flask with alcohol, which seemed to dye silk very easily. The colour remained in the silk even after washing the fabric.,This was the first aniline or coal-tar dye to be discovered.,Perkin collaborated with his brother Thomas and his friend Arthur; together they carried out further trials on the dye and sent samples to Robert Pullar in Perth, who worked in the family firm of
Pullars Dyeworks
. Perkin filed a patent for this process (patent no. 1984 of August 1856).,Perkin’s mauveine quickly became popular after he borrowed money from his father to establish a factory, invented a way for the dye to be used on cotton as well as silk and gave advice to the dyeing industry on how this new synthetic dye worked.,Public demand increase when
Queen Victoria
and Empress Eugénie, wife of Napoleon III were seen in the colour. The Science Museum holds
this incredible example
of this fashion from the 1860s, and
a sample of mauveine dyed fabric
supplied to Queen Victoria.,After the discovery of mauveine, many new aniline dyes appeared (some discovered by Perkin himself), and factories producing them were constructed across Europe. In the pursuit of more and more colours German and British dye manufacturers pushed at the boundaries of chemical knowledge and the experimental work of the dye industry is closely linked to developments in medicine and pharmaceuticals.,Perkin’s synthetic colourant was a gateway, leading to the emergency of the
synthetic dye industry
. This is a celebrated historical story that focuses on firsts, in an industry that produced a
rainbow of fantastic colours
; mauve has become famous because it was the first synthetic dye. Historians of science have often debated the value of the first, the premier discovery.,Often, later variations of an original discovery or invention prove to be most effective or long lasting; a more potent strain of the penicillium mould was sought and found by an American nurse after Alexander Fleming’s original discovery. Even the most famous of natural philosophers Galileo and Newton fought for the recognition of being the first to discover and invent. The race to discover the
structure of DNA
was so fiercely run because being the first to declare the structure would insure a place in history. The scientists that worked on Watson and Crick’s description, establishing the arguably more important knowledge of how DNA codes for proteins are not household names. Historians of science work hard to discover these hidden scientists and technicians.,This obsession with premiership extends to museums and their objects.,The Science Museum collection holds some of the
first samples of mauve
produced by Perkin. Chemical analysis on our dyes and textile samples show that our ‘original mauveine’ was most likely not prepared in 1856 as it’s labelled, but is from a 1906 batch made to celebrate the jubilee of Perkin’s accidental discovery.,Does this diminish the object’s importance? Perhaps it adds another layer to the history?
The shawls
in our collection were dye with Perkin’s original 1856 mauveine formula and exhibited at the International Exhibition of 1862. Should our historical attention shift to these textiles? These objects remind us that focusing on the person or object that came first can sometimes frustrate the efforts of historians to understand the past."

new Mathematics gallery
at the Science Museum, there was one question that I simply had to ask her: given she studied mathematics at university and the pervasive evidence that science is institutionally sexist, how much of a hurdle faces women today and how much of an inspiration would her appointment prove to be?,Her acknowledgement that, even for her, the gender gap remains an issue, and particularly in Britain, surprised me: “I’ve come across it a lot in my career here and I never felt it anywhere else to be honest,” she remarks. Her comments, made during a recent visit to the Science Museum, are particularly salient on
Ada Lovelace
Day (14 Oct), an
international celebration
of the achievements of women in science, technology, engineering and maths.,The Iraqi-British architect was born in 1950 and raised in one of Baghdad’s first Bauhaus-inspired houses. “In Iraq, maths was taught as a way of life,” she recalls. “We used to just do maths to resolve problems continuously, as if we were sketching.”,But when she came to boarding school in Britain in the early 1960s she found that she “was much more advanced in the sciences than many of the kids at the time, not because they were not smart. I think it was badly taught and it’s very important to teach sciences and maths in a way that makes it appealing.”,Before she went to boarding school, aged around 10, Dame Zaha vividly remembers a trip with her parents to the Science Museum. “It was for me at the time extremely fascinating to see instruments and understand about science. And, around the same time, I also went to art museums. I used to come every summer to London when I was in my teens.”,She went on to study mathematics at the American University of Beirut. The explosion of interest in construction and modernity of the 1960s encouraged her to study at the Architectural Association School of Architecture in London. Today, she is one of the most sought-after architects on the planet, the only female recipient of the prestigious
Pritzker Architecture Prize
, considered the Nobel Prize of the field.,From the Aquatics Centre she designed for the London Olympics to Rome’s curvilinear National Museum of the XXI Century Arts and China’s Guangzhou opera house, her concepts are futuristic and often voluptuous, with powerful, curving forms. Her work, she explains, has its roots in movement that is a century old, citing the work of Russian abstract artist
Kazimir Malevich
. The dire economic situation in the West in the seventies “fostered in us similar ambitions: we thought to apply radical new ideas to regenerate society.”,One would have thought that her global success as a ‘starchitect’ is a testament to how the gender gap is no longer a hurdle in Britain. However, like her late British-educated father, an economist and industrialist who helped to found the Iraqi National Democratic party, she found that she had to be dogged to succeed in her career. “I took a risk. “People were thinking I was crazy to do what I did even 30 years ago because it was very risky and that no-one’s going to give me a job. They were right.”,In the 1970s Dame Zaha met Peter Rice, an engineer, who encouraged her and she established her own London-based practice. However, she still struggled for recognition. Twenty years ago, the Millennium Commission refused to fund her winning “crystal necklace” design for the Cardiff Bay Opera House. Dame Zaha said at the time that she had been stigmatised on grounds of gender and race.,There is plenty of evidence that it remains a battle for women to pursue science and mathematics with the same ease enjoyed by men. According to the US National Science Foundation, women comprise only 21% of full science professors (just 5% of full engineering professors) even though they earn about half the doctorates in science and engineering in the US. They have to work harder to make the same impact.,One study, published last December by Cassidy Sugimoto of Indiana University Bloomington, and colleagues, evaluated 5,483,841 papers published between 2008–2012 and concluded that “in the most productive countries, all articles with women in dominant author positions receive fewer citations than those with men in the same positions”.,It is a similar picture for the UK and for architecture too. Last year Dame Zaha criticised the “misogyny” among UK architects, arguing that society is not equipped to help women back to work after childbirth. “You know we still suffer,” Dame Zaha tells me. “ it’s not very smooth. There’s been a problem always – the stereotype is that girls can’t do sciences.”,But, of course, they can. Over the years she has taught at many prestigious institutions, from the Harvard Graduate School of Design to the Hochschule für bildende Künste Hamburg and The University of Applied Arts, Vienna. “Some of my best students are women,” she remarks. “I think it’s very important to encourage them.”,She acknowledges that her struggle and resulting success plays an inspirational role. “I do notice now when I go out to give a talk somewhere there are many girls who come to me. They want to be reassured that they actually can break that barrier and also do it with confidence. That’s why education is very important as it gives you confidence to conquer the next step. That confidence allows you to take risks.”,At the launch of the museum’s new
Mathematics gallery
in September, Dame Zaha was accompanied by museum Director Ian Blatchford, David and Claudia Harding – who made an unprecedented £5 million donation to build the gallery through their foundation – Culture Secretary Sajid Javid and her business partner, architect Patrik Schumacher, who helps Dame Zaha lead her team of 300 people.,Science Museum Curator David Rooney explained how the centrepiece of the forthcoming gallery will be the Handley Page ‘Gugnunc’, a 1929 British experimental aircraft with a 12-metre wingspan that was designed to fly safely at slow speeds from short take-offs.,The aircraft’s aerodynamics proved influential at the very beginnings of civilian air travel. In the same way, the swirling flows of air around the aircraft in flight inspired Dame Zaha’s design and will allow mathematics to take flight in the museum.,﻿
Behind the Handley Page in her design lie three minimal surfaces (they enclose the smallest possible area that satisfy some constraints) that are based on the shapes of the vortices in the turbulence created behind the plane in flight. The equation defining these surfaces is governed by six different parameters and, by tweaking them, a menagerie of sensuous shapes emerges on screen in the offices of Zaha Hadid Architects. “Mathematics and geometry has an amazing influence particularly on our work,” she says. “It’s very exciting.”,Some of these surfaces will provide the backdrops to support display cases used throughout the galleries to provide an appropriate setting for a dazzling range of objects that will span 400 years of science and mathematics. It seems only appropriate to point out, on the day we celebrate the ‘
first computer programmer
‘, that the shapes were generated with Mathematica software.,The
Mathematics gallery
is the fourth commission this year as part of the
redevelopment
of the Science Museum. Wilkinson Eyre has been appointed to create £24 million Medical Galleries; London-based Coffey Architects is designing a new £1.8 million library and research centre in the museum’s Wellcome Wolfson Building; and Muf, a collective of artists, architects and urban designers, was selected to design a £4 million interactive gallery in the museum. Around one third of the building will change over the next few years, marking the biggest transformation of the museum since it was established more than a century ago."
https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/wondering-the-world-better/,Peter Dickinson,Wondering the world better,,At the Museum,,"The Science Museum’s Head of Communications, Peter Dickinson, responds to concerns raised about an image used in the marketing campaign for our new interactive gallery.,Wonderlab: The Statoil Gallery is extraordinary; it is a gallery designed with the sophistication to impress one of the UK’s most respected architecture critics, the
Observer’s
Rowan Moore, while at the same time prompting
Time Out
to write: “If Stephen Hawking and Willy Wonka designed the ultimate science playground then it might go a little like this. The Science Museum’s new ‘Wonderlab’ gallery is the best thing you can currently do in London with kids.”,You can see here the excitement of the competition winners who became the first to experience the gallery
. We’d invited those young people to ‘wonder the world better’ as part of a broader launch campaign about redefining wonder. We wanted to inspire young people to believe that their ‘wonders’ could change the world and they, and many others, have been sharing their wonders with us in the lead up to Wonderlab’s opening.,As
this film, voiced by Sir David Attenborough
, beautifully illustrates, our goal is to encourage girls and boys, men and women to be inspired by the wonder of science, and help more people believe that science is for them. We want people to think differently about the world around them and to recognise that wondering is a powerful, positive tool in the journey to scientific discovery. This idea infuses every aspect of our communications campaign – on which we worked with an excellent creative team at Grey London – from the posters we used prior to opening to those currently on show in the underground.,,Our historical posters, which included the wonders of
Ada Lovelace
and Alan Turing, sought to demonstrate their amazing achievements which started with a wonder. We’ve now released two posters designed specifically to relate to content in the gallery – Flowing Mist, an exhibit where you literally ‘put your head in the clouds’, and our Heat Camera. Our intention is to excite the public about the new exhibits on display, whilst using a simple visual metaphor to help inspire the next generation of scientists by showing them that wondering is powerful.,,,,These posters invite people to think again about phrases in common usage – ‘seeing what you’re made of’ or ‘having your head in the clouds’. The goal of our campaign – and these posters – is to challenge the idea of ‘wondering’ being whimsical, and encourage and inspire young people to wonder, to pay close attention to what’s around them, to be curious and to be creative. Some people have suggested that featuring a girl in the ‘head in the clouds’ poster reinforces a negative stereotype. All we can say is that this is the polar opposite of our intention with this campaign. Indeed, we specifically chose to feature a girl in another of the campaign posters with the headline ‘one day someone will cure cancer’
because
we know that women are under-represented in STEM careers and this is a reality we all want to change.,At the Science Museum, we are passionate about igniting curiosity among everyone and believe we have an important role to play in inspiring more women and girls to become involved in science. Half of our visitors last year – 1.6 million – were women and girls. Research shows that informal learning experiences, such as those enjoyed by Science Museum visitors in interactive galleries since 1931, really do help more people to feel that science is for them.,‘
As part of a family holiday when I was 7 years old (coming to London from Sheffield seemed a long way then) we made a special trip to the Science Museum. Just exploring science for fun was something I had not experienced before. I am sure that set the grounds for a life that just cannot be without science.
’ – Dr Helen Sharman, Science Museum Fellow and first Briton in space.,‘
I have very happy memories as a young child being enthralled by the interactive gallery in the Science Museum. The power of pressing buttons and seeing the exhibits come to life was really exciting – and I remember running from one to the next. Of course things are much more sophisticated now with Wonderlab providing interactive experiences beyond anything we imagined.

Wonderlab

general relativity
stands with quantum mechanics, which reigns on the smallest scales, as a foundation stone of modern physics and will be celebrated over the next few weeks by events worldwide.,Albert Einstein first presented his complete general theory of relativity to the Prussian Academy on November 25, 1915, and it was published—in four short pages— on December 2 that same year (
Zur allgemeinen Relativatstheorie, Sitzungsberichte der Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin
, 831-839).,But the genesis of general relativity stretches back to 1905 when, at the age of 26, Einstein proposed his special theory of relativity to reconcile the laws of electromagnetic radiation with the physics of moving bodies developed by Galileo Galilei and
Newton
. Special relativity posits that the speed of light is always the same, irrespective of the motion of the person who measures it. Special relativity also implies that space and time are intertwined to a degree never previously imagined.,Starting in 1907, Einstein began trying to broaden special relativity to include gravity. His first advance came when he was working in a patent office in Bern, Switzerland and an idea occurred to him:,If a man falls freely, he would not feel his weight… This simple thought experiment… led me to the theory of gravity.,He realised that there is a deep relationship between systems affected by gravity and those that are accelerating.,Then in 1908, Einstein’s former teacher Hermann Minkowski repackaged relativity in a neater mathematical form that dealt with space and time as an inseparable whole, called ‘space-time’. The next step was to find a new language to describe this four-dimensional landscape.,Einstein turned for guidance to
Marcel Grossmann
, the same friend whose lecture notes he had cribbed years before as a student. ‘Grossmann, you must help me, or else I’ll go crazy’ he wrote.,Grossmann acted as Einstein’s guide through the jungles of non-Euclidean geometry, where space is curved so that parallel lines do not exist and the three angles of a triangle do not add up to 180 degrees. Einstein needed a mathematical tool that would allow him to deal with this exotic geometry. In 1913, he and Grossmann published a paper in which they began this programme, using what is called tensor calculus.,As Einstein struggled in Berlin in 1915 to complete the extension of relativity, he increasingly cut himself off from the outside world. Letters were far less likely to be answered than to be impaled on a large meat hook and later burnt. The work was most intense in mid to late November, when Einstein wrote to almost no one, aside from David Hilbert, the great German mathematician, whose work on gravity ran remarkably close to his own.,In November, came Einstein’s epiphany. He revealed to the world that he could now explain an astronomical puzzle — a variation in the orbit of Mercury around the Sun that had perplexed scientists since it was first reported in 1859.,Success showed that, after eight years of groping for the truth about gravity, he had provided a new and profound glimpse of the workings of the universe. His latter-day colleague Abraham Pais has described this as possibly the strongest emotional experience of Einstein’s life. It was certainly a rapturous one. Einstein reported having had heart palpitations and feeling as if something inside him had snapped. ‘I was beside myself with ecstasy for days,’ he told Paul Ehrenfest, the theoretical physicist.,Einstein showed that gravity was not a force from one body acting on another, but a property of space-time itself. Massive objects such as black holes create distortions in the space-time around them, and these four-dimensional curves act as pathways for smaller objects to follow, rather as a ball bearing follows the line of least resistance over a hilly two-dimensional surface.,His exertions left him exhausted. In December 1915 Einstein wrote to his old friend Michele Besso that he was ‘satisfied but rather done in’.,,By Dr Harry Cliff,A century after its birth, general relativity is still science’s ultimate tool for understanding the cosmos. It underpins our modern cosmological theories, allowing scientists to study the birth, evolution and ultimate fate of the universe. It describes the most extreme objects in nature, from the supermassive black holes that lurk at the centres of galaxies to violent collisions between neutron stars. Astronomers have even used general relativity’s predictions of how massive bodies bend light rays to map clouds of invisible dark matter that thread vast clusters of galaxies.,General relativity was so ahead of its time in 1915 that it took decades to explore many of its consequences. Physicists including
Roger Penrose
and
Stephen Hawking
only began to make progress in understanding black holes in the 1960s and 70s, and the prediction of general relativity that the rotation of the Earth should drag space and time along with it has still to be confirmed by observation.,But the most highly anticipated test today of general relativity is the detection of
gravitational waves
, ripples in the fabric of space-time created by the acceleration of massive bodies. Observing these ripples would give astronomers a new window on the universe, allowing them to study exotic objects like black holes and to peer further back towards the Big Bang than is possible using light-based astronomy.,The trouble is that gravitational waves are incredibly weak, and require huge and extremely sensitive instruments to detect. The $620 million
Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory
(LIGO) in the USA offers the best hope to observe them in the near future.,LIGO’s L-shaped observatories work by beaming lasers down two 4km arms at right angles to one another. If a gravitational wave passes by it will cause the two arms to shrink and expand by tiny but different amounts, about a 10,000
th
of the width of a proton. This is then detected as a tiny shift in the arrival time of the laser light’s peaks and troughs, creating what is known as an interference pattern.,Although LIGO has not spotted any gravitational waves yet, it has recently been upgraded and should soon be able to detect ripples in space-time produced by collisions between neutron stars in distant galaxies up to around 650 million light-years from Earth. If gravitational waves are seen in the next few years, it will mark the beginning of an exciting new age of astronomy and of our understanding of Einstein’s greatest contribution to science.,,By Paul Franklin, co-funder of
Double negative,The plot of
Interstellar
, Christopher Nolan’s sci-fi epic, spins around Gargantua a super-massive black hole,
simulated in unprecedented detail
for the film. Black holes had long been the subject of speculation among astronomers going back to the 18th century – a region of space from which nothing, not even light, can escape – but it was general relativity that first allowed scientists to explore the physics underpinning them. Over the last few decades black holes have become a regular feature of science fiction, but we’ve become used to looking at fanciful and, frankly, inaccurate representations of them – we were determined to change that.,For Chris Nolan it was essential to embed real science into the story and then see where it would take us. Relativity allowed us to explore the story possibilities offered by time dilation – through which clocks can tick at different rates for different characters depending on where they are in the universe – and the extraordinary power of Einstein’s equations allowed us to visualise Gargantua, the super-massive black hole that features in the film, and in unprecedented detail.,Gargantua was realised through a unique collaboration between
Kip Thorne
, The Feynman Professor of Theoretical Physics Emeritus at CalTech in Pasadena, California, and Double Negative’s research and development team, headed up by Chief Scientist Oliver James. Kip is a leading expert on general relativity and the inspiration for
Sir Michael Caine’s
character in the film.,Together, Kip, Oliver and our R&D team developed a new suite of software tools to model one of general relativity’s most famous predictions, that the path of a light beam can curve as it passes through gravitationally-warped space. The result was a super-accurate model of the “gravitational lens” around Gargantua which, through the simulation of trillions of light beams, created the stunning images seen in the film – when you see the “waterfall of fire” in the accretion disc cascading around Gargantua you are looking directly at the visual results of Einstein’s ground-breaking work.,Interstellar
also deals with the concept of travel through hypothetical tunnels in space-time connecting distant parts of the universe, also predicted by Einstein’s general theory of relativity.  Work in the 1930s by Einstein and Nathan Rosen in Princeton revealed a solution of the general relativity equations that describes a bridge between two places/times (regions of what scientists call space-time).,This so called ‘Einstein-Rosen bridge’ – what we now call a wormhole – could pave the way to the possibility of moving colossal distances across the universe, and even open the door to a form of time travel. Wormholes are among the subjects tackled in The Science of Interstellar, a book written by Kip to accompany Chris’s movie.,One unexpected – and hugely satisfying – outcome of our work on
Interstellar
was that the requirement of creating Gargantua and the wormhole at such a high level of resolution had revealed some interesting new discoveries about the complex warping of space-time produced by such intense gravity. As a result we were able to publish scientific papers (see
here
and here), including one in the Journal of Classical and Quantum Gravity, featuring our findings.,Interstellar pushes cinematic imagery into new and uncharted territory – there is no better way to enjoy the film and its depiction of the astonishing reality of general relativity than to see it in true 70mm large format film in the Science Museum’s

of the particle in the 1960s, the modest emeritus professor from Edinburgh University is now synonymous with the quest. A small exhibit in the museum’s
Antenna science news gallery
is planned this week to mark the announcement today of the discovery of the Higgs boson by two teams, each consisting of 4000 scientists, at the CERN laboratory, Geneva, which operates the £5 billion Large Hadron Collider, the world’s most powerful particle accelerator.,‘It is a powerful and optimistic day for science and a triumph for amazing patience and rational thinking,’ commented Ian Blatchford, Director of the Science Museum Group.,‘It’s really an incredible thing it’s happened in my lifetime,’ said Higgs, who is in CERN.,There, the resulting splash of energy and particles is dissected by the ‘eyes’ of the machine, huge detectors – ALICE, LHCb, ATLAS and CMS – which reveal traces of new particles and phenomena.,The LHC is designed to answer the most profound questions about the universe and, being the most famous experiment on the planet, is going to be the subject of a new exhibition at the Science Museum next autumn, developed in collaboration with CERN.,Alison Boyle, Science Museum curator of modern physics, says that the forthcoming exhibition will include components of ATLAS and CMS, as well as pioneering explorations of the atom by JJ Thomson, Ernest Rutherford, James Chadwick, and others. She adds: ‘Discovery of the Higgs boson is a great success but there’s still lots more physics to do, and our exhibition will follow the LHC’s scientists and engineers as they explore even higher energies.’,The history of physics is full of tantalising hints of the Higgs that could have been revolutionary, but then evaporated. This time, however, we have concluded the final chapter in the quest, involving 10,000 scientists and engineers from 100 countries.,Excitement about the Higgs has been building for the past six months explained Harry Cliff, the first Science Museum Fellow of Modern Science, who divides his time between the museum and the University of Cambridge team where he works on one of the experiments at CERN.,He explains the current discovery: “’Strictly speaking, it’s the Higgs field that gives most particles mass and the Higgs Boson is a wave travelling in that field – so finding the Higgs Boson is like seeing ripples in the Higgs field.’,Last December, rumours circulated regarding hints of the Higgs at energies of around 125 gigaelectronvolts (GeV), roughly 125 times the mass of a proton. But the catch was that this was around what scientists call a
3-sigma signal
, meaning that there is a 0.13 per cent probability that the events happened by chance. This is the level at which particle physicists will only say they have “evidence” for a particle.,Earlier this week scientists sifting information from 500 trillion collisions at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Tevatron collider, east of Batavia, Illinois, said they had found their strongest indication to date for the particle.,A spokesman said: ‘Our data strongly point toward the
existence of the Higgs boson
, but it will take results from the experiments at the Large Hadron Collider in Europe to establish a discovery.’,In the rigorous world of particle physics, researchers wait to see a 5-sigma signal, which has only a 0.000028 per cent probability of happening by chance, before claiming that the Higgs has been truly discovered. Higgs himself told Graham Farmelo that he wouldn’t drink champagne to celebrate ‘unless and until they have a 5-sigma signal.’,Thanks to the results coming from the two experiments, ATLAS and CMS, today these preliminary findings appear to show a dramatic 5-sigma signal.,If this is indeed a new particle, then it must be a boson and it would be the heaviest such particle ever found.,Speaking at an event in Westminster to discuss the findings, the Minister for Universities and Science David Willetts said: “This news from CERN is a breakthrough in world science. Professor Higgs of Edinburgh University has now secured his place in history.”,Prime Minister David Cameron later
announced
the news is ‘profoundly significant’.,The flurry of publicity today has come as a crowded seminar in CERN, introduced by Director General Rolf Heuer, was held to discuss the CMS and ATLAS 2012 data analysis, on the eve of the International Conference on High Energy Physics, Melbourne.,“We have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature,” said Heuer. “The observation of a particle consistent with the Higgs boson opens the way to more detailed studies, requiring larger statistics, which will pin down the new particle’s properties, and is likely to shed light on other mysteries of our universe.”,The Higgs boson is the final piece of the Standard Model , a framework of theory developed in the late 20th century that describes the interactions of all known subatomic particles and forces, with the exception of gravity.,The Standard Model contains many other particles – such as quarks and W bosons – each of which has been found in the last four decades using vast particle colliders, but the Higgs had remained elusive.,The Higgs boson is critical to the Standard Model, because interacting with the Higgs field is what gives all the other particles their mass. Not finding it would have undermined our current understanding of the universe.,While discovery of the Higgs is a remarkable achievement, many researchers are also eager to hear all the details from the experiments, and how they compare, which may indicate that the Higgs boson has slightly different properties than those theoretically predicted.,Any deviations from theory could suggest the existence of heretofore-unknown physics beyond the Standard Model, including models such as supersymmetry, which posits a heavier partner to all known particles.,‘This discovery is just the start,’ I was told by John Womersley, Chief Executive of the STFC. “This could be the gateway to supersymmetry. Now on to dark matter, dark energy and the theory of everything”,Although most physicists call the particle the Higgs boson, one Nobel laureate gave it the grandiose title of the “God particle”, after his publishers refused to let him call his book “The Goddam Particle”: everyone agrees that it is, without doubt, the slipperiest particle of physics.,Nima Arkani-Hamed, a leading theoretical physicist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, has bet a year’s salary the Higgs will be found at the LHC, and plans to talk about the quest next year at the Science Museum. Although the world’s most famous scientist, Prof Stephen Hawking, has today lost a $100 bet he made against the discovery,
he says that Higgs deserves the Nobel prize
.,Higgs, who refuses to gamble, told me just before the LHC powered up that he would have been puzzled and surprised if the LHC had failed in its particle quest. “If I’m wrong, I’ll be rather sad. If it is not found, I no longer understand what I think I understand.”,When he walked into the crowded CERN seminar today in Geneva, there was a touching round of applause. After a wait of half a century, he is at long last able to celebrate his insight into the mystery of mass with a glass of champagne."

The museum is collaborating with theatre and digital producers to create an immersive experience and give visitors a close-up look at remarkable examples of the collider’s engineering, from the bottle of hydrogen gas that feeds the great machine to its vast and powerful magnets.,The exhibition will feature many historic objects from the Museum’s world-leading collections, including JJ Thomson’s apparatus which led to the discovery of the electron, and the accelerator Cockcroft and Walton used to first split the atom. The project team for the CERN exhibit includes Harry Cliff, the first Science Museum Fellow of Modern Science, who divides his time between the museum and the University of Cambridge team working on the LHCb experiment at CERN.,In his speech to the audience, Ian Blatchford highlighted how, as annual visitor numbers have risen to almost 3 million, the museum is extending its collaborations, not just with CERN and Cambridge but with Imperial College London and the space community too; the museum recently hosted the 50th anniversary of Ariel 1 the first international space mission, and is planning a major exhibition on Soviet-era cosmonauts.,He added that there is also a new emphasis in the museum on collaborations with the arts, from its latest exhibition on the symbolism of
alchemy
to a forthcoming collaboration with the Philharmonia and next year’s Media Space gallery, a partnership with the National Media Museum in Bradford which will focus on visual media.,The museum is evolving. It recently received an award of £6 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) for a 2014 gallery which will tell the story of two centuries of innovation in communication technology. With the forthcoming Media Space Project, the new gallery represents a key step in the delivery of the museum’s

Here are 7 eye-watering ways our ancestors tried to battle the bugs.","At the Museum,Collections and Objects,Science in the news","antibiotics,medicine",",Today we know that mercury is so toxic to humans that using it as medicine would be mad. But in Europe between the 15th and 19th centuries, it was given to treat the bacterial disease syphilis.,Syphilis symptoms include infertility, sores and even death. Mercury was known to kill bacteria, hence it was given in pills or ointments to patients. But it induced severe headaches, tremors, blindness and insanity, meaning this ‘cure’ was often worse than the disease.,,Before antibiotics to treat Tuberculosis became available in 1954, patients were treated with plombage (‘plom–ahj’). Inert material was inserted into a lung, which caused the lung to collapse and kill off the TB infection. Sometimes gases were pumped into the abdomen to help the lung shrink, a process called pneumothorax that often caused perforations and other complications.,,The ancient belief that illnesses were caused by imbalances in vital bodily fluids or ‘humours’ faded as medical science progressed, but certain practices related to it persisted, including bloodletting.,Still in use as recently as the 20th century, bloodletting treated bacterial conditions including TB and pneumonia. It involves draining blood via a controlled incision or the application of leeches until the patient feels faint. Other treatments involving draining bodily fluids include enemas and emetics.,Before antibiotics entered mass production during the Second World War, sphagnum moss was used to dress wounds. Found in abundance in peat bogs, it played a significant role in the fight against infection for decades. It soaked up blood and kept wounds dry while fighting off bacteria—properties which also led to its use in soaps.,,© Wellcome Images (CC),In the 19th century it was observed that tuberculosis patients lived better and longer lives if kept outdoors. TB bacteria are more dangerous in large numbers, so it makes sense that keeping people cooped up with other sick patients would make them worse.,It also explains why, from the 19th century to the 1940s, ‘fresh air’ was a common prescription for TB. Open-air hospitals and schools ensured patients were always outside, even at night, which made their winters harsh. Recovery was rare until tailored antibiotics became available in the 1950s.,,We now regard antiseptics as supporting treatments, but in a world before antibiotics they were applied to many types of injuries and actually saved lives. In the American Civil War, soldiers undergoing double amputations would be repeatedly dipped into baths of antiseptic to prevent their wounds from becoming infected.,,Like syphilis, gonorrhoea is a sexually-transmitted bacterial infection—less severe but still deeply unpleasant and painful. Before antibiotics, the antiseptic silver nitrate was used to treat it.,Silver nitrate kills bacteria on contact. The excruciatingly painful treatment involved injecting a thick syringe full of the stuff through the urethra. This process wasn’t always effective, and doctors often sent patients home with syringes to repeat it themselves until the infection cleared up.,Visit our free exhibition

Here’s his bluffer’s guide to quantum computing.,The basic idea can be glimpsed in a corner of fundamental physics born more than a century ago. The name reflects how they build on the principles of quantum mechanics, which was developed at the start of the 20th century to describe nature at the smallest scales of energy levels of atoms and subatomic particles and chunks, called quanta.,In the 1980s, it was realised that quantum theory had implications for computing, extending theoretical work done by the English mathematician Alan Turing in the 1930s, who came up with a mathematical portrait of a universal computer that would be capable of comporting itself like any other computer.,In 1985, the British physicist David Deutsch pointed out that, because Turing was working with classical physics, his universal computer was not so universal after all. Turing’s theory needed to be extended to quantum mechanics and
Deutsch proposed on 8th July 1985
a universal computer based on quantum physics, which would have calculating powers that Turing’s classical computer (even in theory) could not simulate. Others who played a key role were American physicists Paul Benioff and Richard Feynman, and Soviet physicist Yuri Manin.,Quantum theory, which is deeply counterintuitive, states that when we look at particles we unavoidably alter them and that particles can be in two places at once, a quality called superposition. Moreover, two particles can be related, or ‘entangled,’ so that their properties are linked, regardless of their relative distance in space and time. Albert Einstein termed this ‘spooky action at a distance’ and this strange property means quantum computers can do simultaneous calculations, rather than one at a time.,However, David Deutsch points out: ‘There was a controversy a while ago about whether interference or entanglement was the basic phenomenon that gives quantum computing its power. I had always said interference and I still would. One can argue it either way and it’s kind of a philosophical question.’,,Seth Lloyd is a professor of mechanical engineering and physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who proposed the first technologically feasible design for a quantum computer. He refers to himself as a ‘quantum mechanic’ and in 2018 was interviewed by Roger Highfield of the Science Museum to discuss the rise of quantum theory and the potential of quantum computers.,In 1992, the MIT mathematician Peter Shor showed that calculations that would take a normal computer longer than the history of the universe could be done in a reasonable time by a quantum computer, and the next year Seth Lloyd, now a professor at MIT, came up with the first technologically feasible design for a working quantum computer and started working on the problem.,Classical computers encode information in bits, which can take the value of 1 or 0. You can think of these 1s and 0s  as the currency of on/off switches that ultimately control how a computer works. Quantum computers, on the other hand, explained Prof Lloyd, are based on ‘qubits’, which can represent both a 1 and a 0 at the same time. Entanglement means that qubits in a superposition can be correlated with each other. Harnessing these two principles, qubits can be thought of as much more sophisticated currency for information processing, enabling quantum computers to tackle difficult problems that are intractable using today’s computers.,What is remarkable is that if you add extra qubits, the process scales geometrically: a quantum computer with two qubits could run four calculations at the same time. But a 1,000-qubit device could process more simultaneous calculations than there are particles in the known universe. However, one big issue is a kind of drop-out called decoherence, where qubits lose their useful ambiguity and become humdrum 1s and 0s.,Glimpsing the power of quantum computing, recent years have seen a trickle of interest by researchers turn into a torrent. Google, IBM, Intel, venture capitalists and start-ups – and not just those from Silicon Valley – are racing to create the next generation of quantum computers to help us solve problems, like modelling complex chemical processes, and complicated quantum processes that underpin chemical reactions. ‘To be more precise, the great hope is that quantum computers will solve the electronic structure problem, meaning figuring out accurately how electrons behave in atoms and molecules, which is “intractable” on classical computers for any molecules of a realistic size and hence complexity (because the computational complexity scales exponentially),’ said Prof Peter Coveney of University College London, who leads the
CompBioMed Centre of Excellence.,By the start of this century, there were one qubit machines but now we have 20 qubit chips with an expectation that will rise to around 100 by the end of this year, according to his UCL colleague, Prof John Morton, a quantum technologist.,Thousands of people are now involved in a global quest for quantum supremacy (some call it quantum advantage) which, roughly speaking, refers to the point where a quantum computer can crunch sums that a conventional computer couldn’t hope to simulate. Prof Morton expects that point to be reached this year.,,Prof John Morton, a quantum technologist at University College London and was interviewed by Roger Highfield of the Science Museum in 2018 to discuss the commercial interest in quantum computers, ‘quantum supremacy’ and more.,There are several different kinds, depending on the types of qubits, how you manipulate the qubits, and how you get them to talk to one another.,One relies on a loop of superconductors – materials that have zero resistance to the flow of electricity at low temperatures – that incorporate a ‘Josephson junction’ that allows current flow clockwise and anticlockwise simultaneously, a superposition of states – in other words, precisely what you need for a qubit. In a further complication, qubits in these superconducting computers can come in different types (transmons or Xmons).,In another kind of quantum computer, qubits can be created when the spin of a single atom of phosphorus inside a silicon chip can be put into a superposition, manipulated and then read by applying a microwave pulse. Other kinds of quantum computer harness charged atoms, or ions (one, developed at the University of Sussex, can be seen in the
Science Museum’s Tomorrow’s World gallery
), the spin of protons, or ‘quantum dots’ in semiconductors.,Ultimately it is down to ‘empowering atoms’, according to Prof Lloyd.,Recently the
University of Sussex
led an international collaboration consisting of Google, Denmark’s Aarhus University, the Riken research institute in Japan and the University of Siegen in Germany to draw up a blueprint to build a large-scale quantum computer.,,Because they operate on a fundamentally different principles to existing computers, they are suited to solving mathematical problems, like finding very large prime numbers, which is important in cryptography, so it’s likely that quantum computers could be used to crack many of the systems that keep our online information secure.,The good news is that quantum-based cryptographic systems would be much more secure than their conventional analogues, thanks to the ‘no-cloning theorem’ which forbids eavesdroppers from creating copies of a transmitted quantum cryptographic key.,Researchers are also excited about the prospect of using quantum computers to model complicated quantum processes that underpin chemical reactions, a task that taxes even the biggest supercomputers, according to Prof Peter Coveney, who does such work with a big team in University College London.,Eventually, researchers hope they’ll be able to use quantum simulations to design entirely new molecules for use in medicine. Others are studying the implications for fields such as machine learning, to uncover new patterns in nature, and in artificial intelligence.,,Prof John Morton, a quantum technologist at University College London and was interviewed by Roger Highfield of the Science Museum in 2018 to discuss the extraordinary power of quantum computers.,,Assuming that we will one day all get access to quantum computing via the cloud, Prof John Morton estimates that we will be able to tap this power in a useful way, for instance from our smartphones, within the next decade or so."

Even better, these audiences are global and they are growing all the time.,In the case of the Science Museum Group, 10.8 million visits in 2014/15 to 12.5 million in 2015/16, a rise of 15 per cent. The Science Museum dominates the traffic with 8.5 million visitors, which is not a surprise given it is the most Googled museum in the world, and we have recently seen a remarkable surge in in traffic to the

Flying Scotsman
.,Today we are publishing the
Science Museum Group Digital Strategy
which outlines a three-year programme of digital activity that will transform how our audiences experience the four museums in the group digitally. This blog post outlines some of our thinking behind the strategy and highlights some of the questions we are thinking about.,Historically, the museum experience has begun and ended with the entry and exit of a physical visit. In the digital age, digital channels are increasingly a component of all visits:,Indeed, it is likely that an audience member’s experience of the Museum already includes more than one of these digital touch points and probably others. The qualities of these digital touch points now shape the audience experience as much as the museum spaces.,The digital landscape and audience behaviour will continue to evolve rapidly presenting museums with exciting new ways to fulfil their missions, but also presenting the challenge of how to keep up with ever-changing digital technologies.,Historically, museums have been defined by the buildings they occupy. In the digital age, museums are global online places, accessible to all.,In the online space, museums are only one of an overwhelming abundance of information sources, and there is a first-mover advantage for those museums that establish themselves as the go-to destination for their subject domains.,There are already double the number of online visitors as there are physical visitors to the Science Museum and 45% of these are from outside the United Kingdom. There is a vast potential to grow these audiences and we are working on researching audience needs and exploring the kinds of content that will best serve them.,At the heart of a global ambition is the presentation of the collection online. However, it is critical that the collection – and particularly objects that only look remarkable when you know how they fit into a broader narrative  – is presented along with content that explores its significance and provides wider context.,Our
model of the double helix
may look unremarkable but it captures the moment we understood the structure of DNA, the “most golden of all molecules”, that has carried information since the dawn of life four billion years ago.,To do it justice, we need not only to tell the story of Jim Watson, Francis Crick, Maurice Wilkins, Rosalind Franklin and so on but draw on wider narratives through multiple objects.,Such narratives should enable both linear and nonlinear journeys and be rich with multimedia, taking us to the latest generation of DNA sequencers and beyond.,Historically, these objects and stories have been presented largely in a one-way, broadcast mode: displays with wall texts, books, lectures and tours. In the digital age, the presentation of these objects and stories is interactive, multimedia and participatory.,Aided by digital, audiences are already experiencing the objects and associated stories as never before. These new modes of experience will facilitate deeper exploration of objects and how they operate through interactive installations; comment threads and social media; reuse of the museum’s digital content for creative and research endeavours; and collaborative digital initiatives such as citizen science projects (
Hooked on Music
is just one example of this).,We have a long and distinguished history of developing educational games for our visitors, such as
Launchball
, named ‘Best Game’ and ‘Best in Show’ at the South by Southwest Interactive Festival in Austin, Texas. More recent games include
Transmission
, Futurecade and Rizk, and also apps such as
Rugged Rovers
and
Journeys of Invention
, which have proved hugely popular.,,Over the coming years, the
Science Museum Group
will be transformed by ambitious masterplans at each museum. The use of digital in these spaces will be focused on tried-and-tested technologies used in creative ways. Alongside this we are thinking about the ways in which we can explore the possibilities of the latest digital technologies within the museums. By doing this on a shorter timescale and without the need to sustain these activities indefinitely, we will experiment with new kinds of digital experiences, such as virtual reality.,Given that we are a group of science, engineering and technology museums, there feels like a huge opportunity to take a lead in the sector and we’re excited to see how it shapes up.,Save

],New insights into how to curb climate change, overuse of precious resources, pollution of pristine environments and destruction of ecosystems could come from a better way to use mathematics to model a dilemma known as ‘the tragedy of the commons’.,The tragedy – one of the best known social dilemmas studied in game theory – was first glimpsed by William Forster Lloyd (1794 –1852), an Oxford University political philosopher, who discussed the overuse of common land by people who had rights to use it, say to graze their sheep.,The tragedy captures the idea that resources that do not clearly belong to an individual or a group are likely to be overexploited, since conserving them is in no individual’s interest, and was made famous by the American ecologist Garrett Hardin in a
paper published in 1968
.,The phrase has become the best-loved metaphor among experts to illustrate our chronic inability to sustain a resource – from the oceans to rainforests and even the air that we breathe – that everybody is free to use and, alas, is just as free to abuse.,We see examples of this dilemma in our daily lives, from climate change and forest depletion to litter in the local park and the stack of dirty dishes in the shared office kitchen.,In the latest issue of the journal
Nature
, a more faithful way to model – and understand – the dilemma with mathematics is unveiled by Martin Nowak of Harvard University, working with Christian Hilbe and Krishnendu Chatterjee of the Institute of Science and Technology Austria, and Stepan Simsa of Charles University in Prague.,Previous attempts to come up with a mathematical model of the tragedy made the unrealistic assumption that the commons remained unchanged as people exploited them – in effect, they played the same game in every round of the model.,These approaches could not study the effects of a degrading environment, such as an increasingly overfished sea, or a river as it was being polluted by a local factory, for example.,But using a branch of mathematics and computer science that dates back to the 1950s, known as ‘stochastic game theory’, it is now possible to study how people cooperate more as the environment improves or deteriorates, depending on their actions.,‘It is based on the simple idea that the game changes depending on how we interact,’ said Martin Nowak. The games in question are encounters between people where they can either work together and cooperate or pursue their own selfish motives instead. ‘As an example, you and I write an article together and, if we do well, we may do a book and, if this continues, we might set up a research institute.’,When they explored the new mathematical model, the scientists found that this dependence on players’ actions could greatly increase the chance that players cooperate, provided the right conditions were in place. ‘Our framework shows which kinds of feedback are most likely to lead to cooperation,’ said first author Christian Hilbe.,Using a branch of mathematics and computer science that dates back to the 1950s, known as ‘stochastic game theory’, it is now possible to study how people cooperate or defect as the environment improves or deteriorates depending on their actions and policies.,‘It is based on the simple idea that our actions today change the game we can play tomorrow,’ said Nowak. `Environmental feedback can spur cooperation.’,When they explored the new mathematical model, the scientists found that this dependence on players’ actions could greatly increase the chance that players cooperate, provided the right conditions were in place.,`We have shown how environmental feedback can spur cooperation,’ said Nowak, who has spent decades exploring the laws of cooperation.,These feedback factors include how quickly the resource degrades, whether fisheries in the Atlantic Ocean or the ozone shield that protects the Earth. This might explain why relatively rapid action to ban chemicals such as chlorofluorocarbons were prompted when a dramatic drop in atmospheric ozone that protects life from the sun’s harmful UV rays was detected in Antarctica in 1985 by Joe Farman, Brian Gardiner and Jonathan Shanklin.,A global agreement to protect the stratospheric ozone layer the Montreal Protocol, was finalized in 1987 and it went into force a couple of years later.,Though glaciers have retreated, vegetation ranges have shifted, and trees are flowering sooner, more dramatic changes such as hurricanes becoming more severe, more droughts and heatwaves, increased heavy rainfall and sea level rises take longer to develop than the ozone hole and have had more complex effects; and this perhaps explains why it has been more difficult to come up with effective international cooperation to curb climate change driven by greenhouse gases, he said.,The mathematics suggests the global environment has to deteriorate before our eyes before governments will be spurred on to make things better. ‘When human activity leads to drastic environmental deterioration, through global warming, cooperation becomes the winning strategy,’ said Nowak.,Equally, the mathematical model enables policymakers to explore next steps on a more rational basis.,One option is not to rely on long term environmental decline to spur policymakers into action. Instead we need to devise incentives that work over much shorter timescales, say a year or so.,‘You could give people, cities or countries financial incentives to work together on a problem,’ said Nowak, ‘and, if they succeed, they get these incentives and can move to bigger and more complex problems, along with even larger rewards.’,The financial incentives could for example depend on what is done by each of the players, whether people or countries.  ‘Cooperation leads to more valuable games, defection to less valuable ones, and can be designed to occur quickly enough to make a difference,’ said Nowak.,Nowak, who has spent decades studying the rules of cooperation, added: ‘This new approach is a game changer.’,The Science Museum’s

glass incubator
that features in our new exhibition,
IVF: 6 Million Babies Later
, at a special IMAX event last night, on her 40th birthday.,One of several IVF events at a Lates attended by 3,500 people to mark her birthday, the birth of the reproductive science revolution, and the 70th birthday of the NHS, it began with Louise Brown watching a film of herself being born.,,Among the packed audience was John Webster, an obstetrician and gynaecologist who was present at her birth, many others conceived by IVF, fertility specialists and the public.,With me and Louise on the IMAX stage was Professor Roger Gosden, who began his academic medical research career under Sir Robert Edwards, who won the Nobel prize for his work on IVF, developed with Patrick Steptoe, a gynaecologist and innovator in the field of laparoscopy (keyhole surgery) and Jean Purdy, who some regard as the first clinical or IVF human embryologist.,,Louise Brown began by telling us about the path her parents took to begin their IVF journey. ‘All mum wanted was a baby…she would have done anything.’ Later in the event, she added that when she held her own son in her arms, ‘I realised what my mum meant when she said that she really wanted a baby’.,The scientific background to her birth was given by Roger Gosden, along with a surreal anecdote about warming sausage rolls in equipment used in the research that culminated with him asking Louise if she had an unusual penchant for the British savoury pastry snack.,The birth of Louise just before midnight on 25 July 1978, was a defining moment for reproductive technology pioneered by British researchers. Louise’s birth followed ten years of experimentation, hundreds of failed attempts and many setbacks, involving hundreds of women.,John Webster described the sense of anxiety among the team as mum-to-be Lesley Brown was wheeled into operating theatre. The stakes were high, and tension was exacerbated by film cameras in the theatre.,Doctors of the day thought that IVF was a risky idea driven more by an appetite for headlines than scientific curiosity. And yet knee-jerk revulsion would give way to acceptance when the public and the science funding bodies became aware of the benefits for infertile couples.,Louise entered the world with a cry. Within hours, her ‘miraculous’ birth became worldwide news and has changed the future of human reproduction.,Steptoe, Purdy and Edwards, after two failures, managed to produce the second child, Alastair MacDonald. Prof Gosden added that he only recently discovered that Purdy herself was infertile, with endometriosis.,The Browns would go on to have another IVF child, Natalie, the 40th IVF baby and first to have her own child, conceived naturally.,Louise Brown told the audience that Bob Edwards and Patrick Steptoe were like extended family. ‘I will always be grateful to them for giving me life and 6 million others too.’ Jean Purdy died of malignant melanoma when Louise was seven.,Louise was 14 when she realised the significance of how she came into the world and tells her own story in her book,
Louise Brown: 40 Years of IVF
, written with Martin Powell.,During the event, the 14-day rule that governs human embryo research was discussed, in the context of now being able to grow embryos for longer than ever before, as a result of research by Prof Magda Zernicka-Goetz in Cambridge, along with
the future of embryo research
, from artificial eggs and sperm to artificial embryos.,Louise Brown admitted to the audience that she had already had Happy Birthday sung to her on four continents. The IMAX event ended with the acclaimed singer, pianist and songwriter Joe Stilgoe improvising mash up versions of ‘Happy Birthday’ with songs by her favourite group, Take That, and the record that was number one in the charts when she was born: ‘You’re the One that I want’, by John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John. You can hear the mash-up below.,Afterwards, a special birthday party was held in the
IVF: 6 Million Babies Later
exhibition, along with curators, Connie Orbach and Ling Lee.,With them was Jenny Joy (Robert Edwards’ daughter) and family; Grace MacDonald, mother of second IVF baby, Alistair MacDonald, conceived in Oldham but born in Glasgow; Martin Johnson, former PhD student of Robert Edwards and Emeritus Professor of Fertility Sciences at Cambridge University; Kay Elder, clinical assistant to Patrick Steptoe in Bourn Hall from 1984; Aileen Feeney, Chief Executive of Fertility Network UK plus many of their staff; IVF patients who contributed to the exhibition and whose stories appeared within the exhibition; Director of the Progress Educational Trust Sarah Norcross and team; Dr Kamal Ahuja, director of London Women’s Clinic and members of his team; Natalie Silverman, presenter of the Fertility Podcast; and staff from the Guy’s Hospital Assisted Conception Unit, Herts and Essex, Fertility Centre, the Lister Fertility Clinic and CARE fertility.,After yet another round of singing happy birthday, I presented a card and cake to Louise on behalf of the museum. The audience were given cupcakes decorated with images of human embryos produced in the laboratory of Magda Zernicka-Goetz, which highlights early stages of human development with colourful labelling methods. Julian Hitchcock, who was the lawyer of Edwards, remarked they were ‘Pretty tasty, too.’,Explore the remarkable story of in vitro fertilisation from the opposition and immense challenges faced by early pioneers to the latest research today in

are one of the most immediate means we have to shape the material world around us.,They exist in many different forms, from simple
hammers
to complex
lathes
(get up close with a lathe in our
new film series
).,Together, tools help us to more easily cut, shape, hold, grip, measure and mark material. In doing so, they help us create pleasing new forms and extend our human capabilities.,Over 100 metal tools from the
Science Museum Group Collection
form a new display in the Science Museum (and even more tools can now be seen
online
).,Beyond their shared material, these tools speak to each other in many subtle ways.,There is little overall difference between tin snips for cutting sheet metal, and
surgical shears
used to slice bone in operations.,It is also quite a challenge to tell apart nineteenth century
sugar nippers
from castrating tongs.,But closer inspection reveals that, for all their outward similarities, each
tool
is uniquely adapted to the job in hand.,Longer handles give more leverage, making holding or gripping easier. Cutting blades can curve or hook, to hold material and cut it simultaneously.,Some tools can be held and adjusted with just one hand, keeping the other free for other tasks.,And many tools are
beautifully decorated
, reflecting tools’ importance to the livelihoods of those who used them.,Today,
tools
are often more likely to be part of our home lives than something we encounter at work.,Not everyone is a
carpenter
, or a
surgeon
. But many more of us do
knit
,
cook
,
shave
, fix our
bikes
, make
art
with the kids and complete thousands of other jobs like these.,Whatever we do, tools form vital, cunning extensions of our bodies and our abilities.,You can see

Tom Scott
for the first series. Each fortnight we’ll share a new film on
YouTube
(subscribe

first episode
, curator
Selina Hurley
reveals the surprising story behind this
Jedi Helmet
and how its use in medicine – and not Star Wars – helped save lives.,,The name Jedi Helmet was inspired by the Jedi knights in
Return of the Jedi
– the Star Wars film released in 1983 – and was used to encourage children (and adults) to wear the helmet and not be frightened during an MRI scan.,MRI (
Magnetic Resonance Imaging
) uses high frequency radio waves to build up a picture of the human body and help doctors diagnose illnesses. The copper coils on
the helmets
are aerials which can pick up the radio waves and improve the quality of the scan.,MRI is often used as it does not expose the body to radiation (unlike when you have an
X-ray scan
). It’s also better than X-rays for studying the body’s soft tissues (such as internal organs).,These Jedi Helmets were used in
an MRI machine
at Hammersmith Hospital in the 1980s. That machine was the first of its kind installed in the UK and one of the longest serving MRI machines in the world.
The machine
was removed in 1992 and is now part of the
Science Museum Group collection
.,In Episode two, curator
Doug Millard
explores how
an unremarkable chair
helped NASA astronauts train for space.,,This chair
was used by astronauts training at
NASA’s Johnson Space Center
to operate the Space Shuttle’s remote manipulator arm and manoeuvring thrusters.,The chair’s software would be changed according to the training requirement. The remote manipulator arm or
‘Canadarm’
was an articulated grabber used to deploy or retrieve satellites from the Shuttle’s payload bay.,It was famously used on the deployment and servicing missions of the
Hubble Space Telescope
. Astronauts, attached to the end of the arm, could also be positioned around the Shuttle to assist or to perform other operations outside the Shuttle.,The chair hand control on the left simulated control of the grabber (or “end effector”) so it could grapple or release items, while the rotational hand control on the right mimicked control of the pitch, roll, and yaw of the “wrist joint” near the end of the arm.,Using different software,
this same chair
was used to simulate the use of thrusters to manoeuvre the Shuttle for docking. This first occurred during the
STS-71 mission
in 1995, when the Shuttle Atlantis docked with the Russian space station
Mir
.,In Episode three, curator
Ben Russell
explores the intricate items created by Victorian amateurs using
lathes
(complex machine tools which are used for industry and pleasure).,You can read more about tools in this accompanying
blog post
.,In Episode four, curator
Selina Hurley
returns to share the story behind a
Bed cycle
and the Paralympic games.,,Designed in 1949 by
Dr. Ludwig Guttman
, a Jewish neurosurgeon who escaped to England with his family in 1939, the Bed cycle was used as an exercise bike by paraplegic and tetraplegic patients as part of their physical and psychological rehabilitation.,This Bed cycle was first used in 1946 at the
Chaseley Trust
for Disabled Ex-Servicemen in Eastbourne, Sussex, and was last used by a patient in 1994.,Dr Ludwig Guttmann organised the first ever
Stoke Mandeville Games
which took place on the first day of the
1948 Summer Olympics
in London. Competitors from all over Europe became involved in the annual Games, with Guttmann and the Stoke Mandeville team joining four hundred athletes from 23 countries at the 9th Games, when the
Paralympics
formally launched in Rome in 1960.,Thanks to the pioneering work of Dr. Ludwig Guttman and rehabilitation devices like the Bed cycle, athletes were able to compete in the Paralympics.,Further episodes will be added to this blog post as they are published."

Alexander Fleming
was studying influenza at St Mary’s Hospital in London and noted that a mould, growing accidentally on a bacterial culture dish, had created a bacteria-free circle, known as a zone of inhibition, around itself. He identified the fungus as a member of the genus
Penicillium
. This led to the discovery of the first antibiotic,
penicillin
.,Penicillium
is a fungus that can be commonly found growing on food products such as bread or cheese. The eminent mycologist John I. Pitt observed that ‘rare indeed must be the human individual who has not encountered fungi of the genus
Penicillium
or have been affected by one of the many metabolites produced by them’.,,Fleming himself had a difficult time identifying the exact strain of the fungus – he had thought it was
Penicillium rubrum
until the American mycologist Charles Thom named it
P. griseoroseum
. Over the years, several species of Penicillium have been identified as producing penicillin including
P. griseoroseum,
P. notatum
and
P. chrysogenum
. Many of these moulds have now been re-examined by molecular methods and Fleming’s strain is now known as
Penicillium rubens
.,At the Centre for Agriculture and Bioscience International (CABI), we were delighted to provide a culture of Fleming’s penicillin producing
Penicillium
for the
Superbugs: The Fight for Our Lives
exhibition at the Science Museum. The culture represents one of the most important scientific discoveries of the 20
th
century which has improved the lives of humankind throughout the world. At CABI, we still hold an original ampoule of Fleming’s original
Penicillium
strain and maintain many other historic penicillin producing strains in our Genetic Resource Collection.,During the 1930s and 40s, research groups in the UK and US evaluated many different
Penicillium
strains to see if any could be used to mass produce penicillin. From this work, many of the historic strains have been deposited in CABI’s Genetic Resource Collection. One strain from Fleming’s investigations was transferred to the Imperial Mycological Institute, IMI (part of CABI) in 1945.,The strain Fleming originally sent to Charles Thom was transferred to CABI in 1950 and the first strain to be used to produce pure cultures of penicillin by ‘submerged culture production’ was from Belgium (NRRL 832), deposited at CABI in 1947. In fact, many modern penicillin producing cultures originate from a strain isolated from a mouldy cantaloupe from Illinois in the 1940s. This strain is also maintained at CABI, together with various other strains used for production and development in the 1940s, 50s and 60s.,Today Fleming’s strains are part of a much larger culture collection, a living ‘zoo’ of microorganisms. Our Genetic Resource Collection consists of 30,000 strains of fungi and bacteria from around the world – a reflection of CABI’s work and mission to improve lives by solving problems in agriculture and the environment. The collection is unique and rich in biodiversity, with cultures deposited from a variety of different ecosystems, including tropical forests, Antarctic lakes, aeroplane tanks and the leaves of oak trees. Collections such as ours support scientific research while providing opportunities to discover new microbial products. In addition to antibiotics, microorganisms can be used to create products that are used every day such as cholesterol lowering and immunosuppressant drugs, enzymes for industry and domestic detergents, as inoculants to improve soil and plant health, and for food and drinks.,The collection marked its 70
th
anniversary in 2017, and is maintained at the CABI UK scientific base in Egham, Surrey.  It incorporates the UK Collection of Fungus Cultures, the National Collection of Wood Rotting Fungi and the British Antarctic Survey’s Culture Collection.,For more information see

Sokol KV-2 emergency space suit
worn by ESA astronaut Tim Peake during his Principia mission to the International Space Station (ISS) is to go on long-term display at the National Space Centre in Leicester. Tim himself said: ‘From next summer it will take pride of place in the Space Centre’s new exhibit charting an astronaut’s journey from training through to their mission launch, time in space and return to earth.’,Now you can see Tim’s spacesuit in a brand-new permanent exhibition launched this year at the National Space Centre highlighting launching, living and working in space. Tim’s suit will stand alongside garments worn by Apollo astronaut Buzz Aldrin, UK Born NASA astronaut Piers Sellers and even the EVA suit worn by Matt Damon in the movie The Martian.,Tim’s  Sokol KV-2 emergency suit joined the Science Museum Group earlier this year with the support of the UK Space Agency and the National Space Centre, and has since been touring the country alongside the hugely successful
UK tour of Tim Peake’s spacecraft
that took it all the way to the International Space Station and back.,If you’ve visited the
Soyuz TMA-19M
capsule on its tour, presented in partnership with global technology innovators Samsung, you’ll have noticed that there is very little room inside for the three astronauts that occupy it – barely enough to sit, and no space to stand upright. This also means that a Soyuz spacesuit needs to be made to fit exactly to the astronaut’s size and shape so that it’s airtight and restrictive in movement – this is why they often seem too small and appear hunched.,As Tim explained, ‘The Sokol’s shape is contoured for sitting in the Soyuz couch in a foetal sitting position, and this shaping of the suit makes it impossible to stand upright and causes the ‘cosmonaut stoop’ as we walk out to the rocket’.,Hear more about the spacesuit from Tim himself in this video:,,Find out more about Tim Peake’s Spacecraft tour

Science Museum Lates
on 28 November.,Dr Patrick Vallance was speaking at a special event organised jointly by the Museum and the Association of British Science Writers during one of his first public appearances since taking up his role in April.,Dr Vallance, who has had
a distinguished career
in medical research in academia and industry, began by outlining the key parts of his job before answering questions from Dr Roger Highfield, the Museum’s Director of External Affairs who chaired the event, as well as journalists and members of the public.,He said that his overall responsibility is ‘to give advice to the Prime Minister and Cabinet on all matters of science’, and included four main elements.,In providing ‘science for policy’, Dr Vallance’s main task is to lead the network of chief scientific advisers who operate inside most Government Departments.,He also looks after ‘science for resilience’ against threats such as natural disasters and other threats. He said that this aspect of his job had become ‘all-consuming’ at an early stage following the Novichok attack in Salisbury.,Dr Vallance also stressed the importance of ‘science for the economy’. He said: ‘The UK has been unbelievably good at research, basic research, and the ability to get publications out, and we punch well above our weight. We’ve been not bad at translating that research into economic benefit but there is absolutely room for improvement.’,Another key area for Dr Vallance’s work in 2019 will be ‘science for citizens’, focusing on the role of people as users, demanders and participants in science.,He also highlighted three areas of external influence on his role: Brexit, the formation of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), and the Government’s Industrial Strategy. Dr Valance drew attention to the importance of the Government’s aim to increase funding for science from 1.7% of GDP today, which he admitted is ‘low by international standards’, to 2.4%, the current average for OECD countries, and eventually 3%.,On the implications of Brexit for science, Dr Vallance said: “The biggest general fear is the UK being seen as inward-looking and not open to collaboration. I mean that is an absolute disaster in science.,‘Science depends on the movement of individuals, it depends on ideas coming in it depends on diversity it depends on the ability to collaborate with people across the world, so any notion that comes out of this that somehow we are a parochial inward-looking science establishment is I think profoundly damaging.’,Dr Vallance noted that scientists in the UK have very close ties with their counterparts in other European countries and that the current system ‘works very well’. He warned: ‘A complete no-deal Brexit which leaves you with no access to European programmes is going to be very damaging.’,When asked about the significance of
the recent announcement
that a Chinese researcher had used gene editing technology on babies, Dr Vallance said: ‘It is very difficult to know how much of a set-back it is in terms of societal expectation and concerns’.,‘This is profoundly uncertain territory when one’s looking at modifying a gene, potentially in the germ line, so an inherited gene.’,He praised
a recent report by the Nuffield Council on Bioethics
which set two criteria for the acceptability of the editing of inheritable genes, namely that it should be in the interests of the welfare of the individual and that it should not have an impact on society such that it caused marginalisation or division. Dr Vallance said that the information from China suggested that this case ‘does not meet those criteria’.,He said: ‘It’s extremely premature to rush into this’. He added: ‘It is a pretty extreme experiment that is going to cause a lot of potential disruption to a field [gene editing] that has a lot of promise in other areas’.,In response to a question about the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the National Health Service, Dr Vallance said that the goal should not be to reduce the contact that patients have with doctors. He said: ‘When one’s ill, you are at the most vulnerable position that you could ever be in in your life and the aim of AI should be to allow more human interaction. In other words it should free up time for people to be able to deal with the other aspects of healthcare that do require human interaction. I don’t think we should think of it as a replacement somehow.’,In response to further questions, Dr Vallance emphasized the potential for data visualisation to have a big impact on how government uses science, and referred to
‘a really brilliant article’
by the late Kofi Annan, former United Nations Secretary-General.,He also pointed to the importance of UK’s support for science overseas, and gave the example of the British Government and companies developing the vaccines to tackle an outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo.,Listen to a recording of the event below:"

The Science Museum Group are a key partner in the campaign, offering a varied events programme across four sites – the
Science Museum
in London, the
Science and Industry Museum
in Manchester, the
National Science and Media Museum
in Bradford and the
National Railway Museum
in York – in the largest cross-group collaboration project ever, supported by Bechtel and BEIS.,The Year of Engineering campaign was designed to help address the severe skills gap in the UK engineering sector: experts estimate that we’ll need almost 2 million more engineers by 2020. Therefore the focus of this campaign was to reach young people, in the hope that their experience might inspire them to consider a future career in engineering.,Minister for the Year of Engineering, Nusrat Ghani, said:,‘I would like to thank the Science Museum Group for its amazing commitment to bringing engineering to life for thousands of families, as part of the Government’s Year of Engineering. It’s fantastic to see the immense contribution the group made to the campaign’s goal of delivering more than one million direct experiences of engineering over 2018 through interactive exhibitions, workshops and the dedication of so many volunteers at its museums across the country. Alongside the Year of Engineering’s 1,400 partners, the Science Museum Group has helped to deliver a tangible and positive shift in attitudes towards engineering careers among young people on which we look forward to building in 2019 and beyond.’,We partnered with the Science Museum Group during 2018’s Year of Engineering.

At Bechtel, every year is focussed around engineering so our activities won’t stop here. We will continue to help students of all genders discover the amazing careers possible in engineering.’,Professor Lynne Gladden, Executive Chair of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), said:,‘Engineering plays a vital role in driving innovation and economic growth. UKRI has been proud to support the Year of Engineering and SMG to inspire young people from all backgrounds to take a closer look at engineering and showcasing the variety and creativity of this forward-looking sector.’,The Group’s focus was on hosting events where families could explore the wonders of engineering. Between running regular engineering-themed workshops and shows at weekends and putting on flagship family festivals – including Future Engineers in York, We Are Engineers in London, as well as engineering sections at the Bradford and Manchester Science Festivals – all four sites pulled together to reach an impressive 120,000 children and 120,000 adults.,Efforts also extended outside of school holiday periods: throughout the year the Group welcomed hundreds of school trips, inviting students to take part in various engineering-themed programmes across the country. Whether building and testing their own catapults in London, designing robotic racers in Manchester or writing code and fixing hardware in York, over 18,000 schoolchildren across the country got the chance to discover engineering for themselves and meet professional engineers face to face.,But for us the Year of Engineering wasn’t just for kids. We gave our adult audiences the chance to have fun and learn a few tricks at Engineering Magic Lates in Bradford, or to become exoskeleton-clad superheroes at Engineering Lates at the Science Museum. Down in London we also hosted a panel discussions around the ‘Science of F1’ and the ‘Art of Engineering’ drawing crowds of interested adults, as well as our IMAX screening of Marvel’s
Black Panther
as part of the
Women in Engineering Family Festival
, to explore the importance of diversity in engineering.,A key part of our Year of Engineering events at all sites was giving people that chance to meet real engineers for themselves. In a new initiative for all museums in the Group, we invited expert volunteers to our museums to get involved and share their experiences with our visitors. We received lots of interest and in the end we welcomed almost 1000 volunteer engineers across all sites, who collectively contributed over 6,500 hours of their time to helping us inspire the futures of our young audiences. We’d like to say a huge thank you to all of them, as we couldn’t have delivered such a fantastic programme without their hard work.,Welcoming in new volunteers gave us the chance to focus on our second major goal: highlighting diversity. Engineering in the UK isn’t the most balanced field: only 12% of engineers are female and only 8% come from BAME backgrounds. We wanted young people to see engineers like them, people they could relate to and who shared their interests, so we aimed to represent these communities in our volunteer pool. Happily we exceeded our goals: over 40% of our volunteers were female and almost 15% were from a BAME background, helping ensure that our visitors had the chance to find an engineer like them.,With all these interactive events taking place across the country, it’s easy to forget all the other ways we champion engineering. We saw over half a million people explore our Engineering themed galleries
Engineering Your Future
at Science Museum and
Testing
and
Engineering The Now
at the National Railway Museum, and tens of thousands settle down to watch our flagship engineering IMAX film,
Dream Big.,As a key partner in the Year of Engineering campaign we’re proud to have reached so many people with such an important message in so many creative and engaging ways. The final figures reveal that as a result of all our activity, we’ve given the public 4.5 million interactions with the Year of Engineering brand, and that as a group we’ve offered young people over 135,000 engineering-related interactions – 13% of the campaign’s overall target for the year. With any luck perhaps some of those will now be thinking that engineering is, in fact, a career for them.,Our Year of Engineering programme was presented in association with HM Government’s Year of Engineering campaign, made possible with the generous support of

Researcher Tom Parton shares more.",At the Museum,,"In our lab at the
University of Cambridge
, we study how living things use their internal structure to change their appearance. What we see in the natural world inspires us to find new ways to make colourful, sustainable materials. Our goal is to make colorants – things like dyes and pigments – that are cheap, durable, non-toxic and biodegradable.,Nature is overflowing with beautiful colours, from the camouflage of chameleons to the dazzling tail-feathers of peacocks. The way these creatures look depends on how their bodies interact with the different colours that make up white light. Many of the colours seen in nature are produced by pigments – special chemicals in the skin, fur or exoskeleton of the organism which absorb some colours and reflect others.,However, the most spectacular colours in nature are made in an entirely different way, using a phenomenon called
light interference
. If you’ve ever noticed the pinks and blues glistening on the surface of soap bubble, then you’re already familiar with this effect and the kind of beautiful colour it can produce.,Over millions of years of evolution, living things have developed complex structures in their outer layers which use interference to enhance some colours and dissipate others. This so-called
structural colour
is responsible for the most intense reflection found in nature, the fruit of the “marble berry” (
Pollia condensata
)
.
Structural colour is found in almost every kind of living thing; you may be familiar with examples like iridescent green dock beetles (
Gastrophysa Viridula
) or mother-of-pearl.,Colours are an important part of daily life for humans too. We use dyes in our clothes, and paints for decoration and design. Complex colour patterns are used to prevent counterfeiting, like the shiny “holograms” you might have seen on bank notes and credit cards. However, these sources of colour have their drawbacks: they’re often made from chemicals and plastics that fade over time and can’t be recycled.,To find more sustainable sources of colour, we look again to what we see in nature. The colours in nature are often built up from simple biological “building blocks” – things like cellulose (found in plants like cotton and pine trees), chitin (found in fungi and crustaceans) and keratin (found in bird feathers and human hair). These bio-materials are highly abundant, biodegradable and non-toxic, which makes them perfect for producing more eco-friendly colorants. In fact, they’re even edible – you eat cellulose every time you eat an apple and chitin every time you eat mushrooms!,In our exhibit, we will show you some examples of the dazzling structural colours that you can find in beetles and other creatures. We will also show you how nature inspires us to create our own colourful materials in the lab using simple biological building blocks.,Can a sustainable future be colourful?

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/7-influential-gaming-characters/,Khalil  Thirlaway,7 Influential Gaming Characters,Exhibition Content Developer Khalil Thirlaway takes a look at some of the most influential characters in gaming’s long history.,"At the Museum,Exhibitions and Galleries","gaming,Power UP,public history","Along with how a game plays, looks and feels, the characters are a hugely important part of video games. Some characters get multiple outings, some are immortalised in films, books and novelty lunchboxes, and others are forgotten and consigned to the landfill of history (I’m looking at you, Zero the Kamikaze Squirrel). Here are just a few of the most influential characters…,,Arguably the daddy of all video game stars, Pac-Man was one of the first recognisable characters to appear. In 1980 there were limits to how much detail could be achieved with just a handful of pixels, so a yellow circle eating white dots was what you got. He was even honoured with a
Google Doodle
in 2010. Special shout out to the ghosts Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde.,,Nintendo’s mascot started off as a nameless nobody in someone else’s game! In 1981’s
Donkey Kong
the player controls a moustachioed, red-and-blue clad carpenter trying to rescue his girlfriend from a giant ape. After trying the super-catchy names “Mr. Video” and “Jumpman”, he ended up as Mario the plumber in 1983’s
Mario Bros
. He has continually evolved with the times, surviving the
Console Wars
of the 1990s (sorry Sonic) and stamping his name on some of the biggest games to this day.,While not the first game to use stealth as a major gameplay mechanism (that honour goes to
Shoplifting Boy
from 1979), the
Metal Gear
series is definitely the most successful.
Metal Gear
was the brainchild of Hideo Kojima, a god of video game design. With intricate plots, outlandish bosses and
that noise
, Solid Snake has seen his fair share of Tactical Espionage Action over the years.,,In 1996, out of 150 pocket monsters, this electric mouse became possibly the most recognisable character in the world.
Pokémon
Red
and
Blue
used the Game Boy’s link cable to let players trade and battle their Pokémon, which changed the game from an individual experience to a social one. The
Pokémon
series has since grown to 76 games,
over 800 different
Pokémon
, 20 films, a long-running cartoon, manga comics, a card game and even a
Monopoly
set.,In an art form dominated by male heroes, this pistol-toting archaeologist is a long-standing strong female lead. Along with
Metroid
’s
Samus Aran
, she is credited with paving the way for other video game heroines. As with many female characters, her appearance has been the focus of much debate over the years, although in recent incarnations she’s presented much more as a rugged survivor than the caricatured sex symbol of the 1990s.,The hero of the
Half-Life
series is a favourite here at the Science Museum. While most shoot-em-up heroes are muscle-bound super-soldiers, Dr. Freeman is a theoretical physicist who accidentally opens an interdimensional rift and has to battle the ensuing alien invasion despite zero military training. Scientists as reluctant action heroes have since featured in more recent games such as
Dead Space
and
Prey
.,Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice
is a 2017 game about a woman journeying to Hell to rescue her love. It’s also a game about living with psychosis. The developers worked with neuroscientists, mental health specialists and people living with psychosis to produce a powerful, unsettling experience which has been credited with helping to open up conversation about mental health.,That was just a selection of some of gaming’s influential characters. There are many more we could have mentioned, if we’d had the time. Which ones do you think are missing from this list?,Explore more at

, decorated with tools of the trade and the owner’s name. Netherlands 1701-1750.,The bowl had been broken in the past. It was repaired using an old conservation technique, involving stapling the fragments back together. A large missing section was filled with plaster, painted and glazed. Other areas, where the original ceramic glaze was chipped, were painted over to hide imperfections. Over time, the repair had aged and significantly yellowed.,My conservation treatment aimed to minimize the appearance of the old repairs, without removing them entirely. Repairs become part of the object’s history, and our goal is not to hide them, but to ensure that the overall focus remains on the object itself.,I began by cleaning the overall surface to remove dust and excess overpaint. I assessed all the joins to ensure that they were stable and consolidated these where necessary.,I then focused on improving the filled area. This involved removing the yellowed glaze, while leaving the underlying paint layer intact. Any voids between the bowl and plaster fragment were supported by the addition of filler to ensure the join remained stable.,This series of images shows removal of the yellowed glaze.,To even out the existing paint layer and the newly filled areas, I applied thin coats of paint colour-matched to the original surface. Colour matching involves mixing various pigments to attain the correct colour, which isn’t as straightforward and simple as applying paint straight from a tube!,The end result:,As good as new…ly repaired.,Stay tuned for

Doctor Who
script from 1966 in the archives of Imperial College London, penned by their eccentric former Professor of Heavy Electrical Engineering, Eric Laithwaite.,At the time, I thought it was an interesting curiosity, but not much more. After alluding to the script in a talk I gave on Laithwaite at the Science Museum,
a colleague put me in touch
with author and radio producer Simon Guerrier, who writes for the official
Doctor Who
Magazine
.,My colleague
@pertieroopster
has a copy of the script!
#dalek,— Natasha McEnroe (@natashamcenroe)
March 28, 2018,,‘I knew there wasn’t a
Doctor Who
TV story by Laithwaite,’ Simon recalls his initial reaction. ‘Knowing he had been interviewed for but missed out on the job of
Doctor Who’s
scientific adviser in 1966, I thought Rupert must be wrong! But no, very excitingly, he’d seen the script himself!’,By the late 1960s, Eric Laithwaite was at the height of his public fame, regularly appearing on television, including the 1964
Horizon
Christmas special. He was best known for his linear motor and its application to new forms of hovertrain transport, later becoming the so-called ‘father’ of Maglev.,Laithwaite was also a keen supporter of the Science Museum, donating his early prototypes, presenting a BBC programme on the (former) electrical engineering gallery, and designing a linear-motor mobius strip demonstration for the old mathematics gallery.,When Simon came to see me at the museum, I was delighted he was interested in the script and that he wanted to research it further for a piece in
Doctor Who
Magazine
(as a fan of the series, it was a proud moment to see my name in its pages).,Simon was able to provide some additional context. In the first weeks of 1966 Laithwaite was invited to meet
Doctor Who
story editor Gerry Davis, who was looking for a scientific advisor for the show. The candidates included Patrick Moore (presenter of
The Sky at Night
), Alex Comfort (later author of
The Joy of Sex
) and ophthalmologist Kit Pedler.,Pedler got the job and he and Davis went on to create the Cybermen.,It was following this interview that Laithwaite wrote a script called ‘A New Dalek Adventure’.,In Laithwaite’s script, the Doctor and his two companions, Stephen and Dodo, are faced with what at first appears to be Daleks yet, as they soon discover, are in fact a new entity that can rearrange its atoms to whatever form they like. In doing so, they have wiped out the Daleks for good.,Laithwaite’s script is dialogue-driven, exploring philosophical ideas such as good and evil and collective thought through the idea of a being that can manipulate atoms in time and space.,Laithwaite sent the script to the BBC, but without success.,Yet, as Simon uncovered, Laithwaite’s encounter with
Doctor Who
inspired his Christmas Lectures – the famous series for schoolchildren dating back to 1825 – for the Royal Institution
later that same year.,Laithwaite’s 1966 series, ‘An Engineer in Wonderland’, was the first to be televised in their entirety, a decision made by David Attenborough when he was controller of BBC2.,Laithwaite’s Christmas Series was the first series that took engineering as its subject. He explored it from many angles, using Lewis Carroll’s
Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland
as his thematic hook.,Simon learnt that Laithwaite explored the central idea of his
Doctor Who
script – about the way we perceive dimensions and the limits of our perspective – further in his Christmas Lectures.,Doctor Who
even gets a mention in the first lecture, as well as in his lecture notes, the preview Laithwaite wrote for listings magazine
Radio Times
, and the book version he wrote afterwards.,Later gaining a reputation for outlandish ideas, Laithwaite’s
Doctor Who
script is testament to his imaginative approach to scientific thinking.,‘It’s a fascinating story and completely new to me,’ says Simon, ‘as well as to the
Doctor Who
experts I consulted while writing up the feature. Given what we now know, I think Laithwaite might even have inspired a character in one of the TV stories from the time, one that involved the Daleks!’,Read more about Laithwaite’s script and his Christmas Lectures in

I now live and work in the city of Rio de Janeiro.,SM: What inspired you to become an artist?,RA: I do what I do because I believe it’s the most authentic way of dealing with my fascinations, passions, quirks, insecurities, vanity, and fears. In a way, my work responds to internal questions. So, I believe I became an artist because I was inspired by the possibility of understanding myself and, in some way, the world in which I live.,SM: How do you feel art and science complement each other?,RA: I believe that both science and art are tools which allow us to be in touch with – and somehow provide answers to – our concerns as human beings.,SM: How would you describe your work?,RA: In my works I suggest negotiations between day-to-day life and the practice of painting. ‘Very Nice’ is part of a series of prints in which I investigate the possible intersections between painting and the ordinary imagination of the tropics. These harmonies nearly always consist in pure, ultra-luminous warm colours, which belong to a visual lexicon commonly associated with the idea of joy, fortune, and fertility. Here, they are confronted so to propose unexpected articulations.,SM: How do you want people to feel when they see ‘Very Nice’?,RA: I wouldn’t want to tell people how to feel when in contact with my work, but I can give you my personal testimony. ‘Very Nice’ reminds me of my childhood and adolescence at the city’s beaches, and of the endless television and video game sessions I had in the flat in which we used to live. It makes me somewhat fascinated and intoxicated by the radiance of the colours which are almost as bright as light.,Header image: Very Nice by Rafael Alonso, 2018, commissioned for the exhibition

But sunshine has inspired more than just the iconic Ray-Bans and the dainty straw boater.,Throughout history fashion designers have sought to capture the glow of our nearest star in a variety of ways, through warm tones, gauzy textures and futuristic sunglasses.,The Sun has long been associated with grandeur and royalty as King Louis the XIV of France knew all too well. Styling himself as the Sun King he adopted the star as his emblem claiming that France revolved around him as the planets revolved around the Sun. He performed to the delight of his courtiers in
Ballet de la nuit
as the Greek Sun God Apollo, in an ornate costume decorated with curlicued sun rays. His emblem still adorns the gates of the Palace of Versailles today.,The Sun was also a key source of inspiration for perhaps the most famous designer of all time – Coco Chanel. It was Chanel who reversed a centuries-long trend for the wealthy to maintain a pale pallor (often through the use of poisonous mercury) by tanning on holiday in the Mediterranean in the 1920s. The photographs of her disembarking from her yacht in Cannes with a ‘healthy glow’ became iconic, and overnight a touch of
soleil
became less
très paysan
and more
très chic
. To paraphrase Christopher Marlowe, Chanel’s became the face that launched a thousand bronzers.,Fast forward to S/S 2017 and Gareth Pugh dressed models in operatic costumes that borrowed motifs from Roman mythology with glowing crowns covered in spiky sun rays. Pugh reflected on the source of his inspiration
post-show
:,“In one way the sun is a symbol of creation and warmth – an explosion of power and life – but it can also represent tyrannical power and destruction…So I wanted to explore that duality, to show two sides of the same coin, but for grace to triumph over nature.”,This year, designers waved goodbye to the rose quartz shade of millennial pink and adopted ‘Generation Z yellow’ – a bold shade that hints at rave culture, sunshine and a fearless optimism. From Oscar de la Renta to Tibi it popped up on dresses, prints and in uncompromising beauty looks.

XMM-Newton
space observatory launched. The biggest scientific satellite ever built in Europe, it has studied black holes, tracked how chemical elements are scattered in supernova explosions, and revealed that Mars’s atmosphere is bigger than previously thought.,XMM stands for X-ray Multi Mirror (the Newton bit is in honour of a certain Sir Isaac). X-rays can pass right through ordinary mirrors, so each of XMM’s three telescopes contains 58 cylindrical gold-plated mirrors nested together. Incoming X-rays skim the inside of the mirrors, a bit like stones skimming off water, and come to a focus at the telescope’s detector. You can see what one of the mirrors looks like in our
Cosmos & Culture exhibition
.,Cosmos & Culture also has a whole X-ray telescope on display. The Joint European X-Ray Telescope (JET-X) is the largest telescope ever constructed in Britain. Unfortunately for the project team at the
University of Leicester
, the
Soviet-led mission
it was part of was cancelled after the USSR collapsed. But it’s fortunate for us, as it means we get to display a rare example of a real space telescope. Most of the space hardware you see in museums is prototypes or spares (like the XMM mirror), as the real thing is either waaaaaaaay up there, or has burned up on re-entry.,An example of a real space telescope that actually made it into orbit is the
Spacelab 2
XRT (it stands for X-ray telescope, funnily enough). It flew on the Shuttle in 1985 and imaged the centre of our galaxy. XRT was in a pretty sorry state when we acquired it in 2005, as it had been dismanted and stored in a university building for years. The building was due for demolition so we had to collect XRT quickly before it ended up in a skip. We reunited the four members of the original
University of Birmingham
team at our
Wroughton
store. Working with our conservation team over several weeks they painstakingly pieced it back together, with only a few missing parts having to be re-made.,XRT now stands proudly in the centre of our

There were no longer restaurant tables “reserved for non-smokers” or designated “smoking areas” within pubs.,Luckily, before they went, I managed to collect a few such examples for our collections. A quest that required trawling around numerous pubs, cafés and restaurants – a tough job, I know, but it had to be done.,The bans were a big expansion of

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/a-date-to-remember-relatively-speaking/,Richard Dunn,"A date to remember, relatively speaking","One hundred years ago, two teams of British astronomers travelled thousands of miles to photograph the solar eclipse of 29 May 1919.",Collections and Objects,,"One hundred years ago, two teams of British astronomers travelled thousands of miles to photograph the
solar eclipse of 29 May 1919
. But they weren’t just there for the spectacle – they intended to prove
Albert Einstein’s
relativity theory
.,Much like today, few people understood Einstein’s work in the 1910s. Those who could get their head round it, however, knew that if his ideas were correct, a massive body like the Sun would bend any light passing near it. A way to test this would be to photograph the stars around the Sun during an eclipse and then photograph them again when the Sun was further away from them. Comparing the images would allow you to measure any displacement in the stars’ apparent positions.,According to Einstein’s theories, the change should be 1.75 arcseconds, twice the value predicted by Newtonian physics. To put that figure in context, it’s like trying to measure the width of a penny from a mile away. But that was exactly what two teams of British astronomers hoped to do in 1919. To add to the challenge, they had to transport their equipment to Sobral in northern Brazil, and the island of Príncipe, off the west coast of Africa.,One of the architects of the plan was
Arthur Stanley Eddington
, professor of astronomy at Cambridge and an active promoter of Einstein’s theories (he was one of the few people who understood them). As a Quaker and pacifist, he also welcomed the opportunity to promote international cooperation after global war. Eddington went to Príncipe with clockmaker Edwin Cottingham, while
Charles Davidson
and
Andrew Crommelin
of the
Royal Observatory, Greenwich
, went to Brazil.,Each team took a large telescope, used to capture the image fed into it from a coelostat, a clockwork-driven mirror that counteracted Earth’s rotation during long exposures of up to half a minute. The Sobral team also took a second, smaller telescope as backup.,Transporting the delicate equipment was understandably daunting in a world still under wartime restrictions. Helped by colleagues in Portugal and Brazil, the teams arrived at their observing sites well ahead of the eclipse, giving them time to rehearse for the five minutes of totality and overcome any problems. Eddington worried about cloud, rain and mischievous monkeys on Príncipe. Strong winds damaged the observing hut at Sobral, but rain washed away the dust clogging the coelostats. The heat made the photographic plates unstable, so developing had to be done at night.,Despite the careful preparations, the day of the eclipse was tense as cloud threatened to ruin the observations on both sides of the Atlantic. Eddington saw little of the eclipse itself and was ‘conscious only of the weird half-light of the landscape and the hush of nature, broken by the calls of the observers, and the beat of the metronome ticking out the 302 seconds of totality’.,The two teams took over 40 photographs, but concerns mounted as they began developing images. Clouds had obscured the stars on many of the Príncipe images; only two could be used for the crucial measurements. The photographs from the larger Sobral telescope were no better: the coelostat mirror had distorted in the hot sun. Luckily, the smaller telescope’s images looked promising. But comparison photographs still had to be taken, followed weeks of painstaking measurement and calculation.,It was only in November 1919 that the results were announced at a meeting in London. When they were, it was the photographs from the smaller telescope at Sobral that proved decisive and were then distributed to astronomers worldwide. Some recent authors have suggested that there was a bit of cherry-picking here since the figures from the larger Sobral telescope’s images were closer to the Newtonian value. But it is clear from the careful preparations at Sobral and on Príncipe that the astronomers understood how their instruments had performed and how far they could trust the results from each. The world’s press was in no doubt.

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/how-to-land-on-venus/,Doug Millard,How To Land On Venus,On the anniversary of Venera 7’s launch - the first spacecraft to successfully land on Venus - curator Doug Millard reflects on the challenge of exploring other worlds.,Exhibitions and Galleries,"cosmonauts,exploration,photography,robotics,space","Over a 20-year period from the mid-1960s, Soviet scientists and engineers conducted one of the most successful interplanetary exploration programmes ever.,They launched a flotilla of spacecraft far beyond Earth and its Moon. Some failed, but others set a remarkable record of space firsts: first spacecraft to impact another planet, first controlled landing on another planet and the first photographs from its surface. The planet in question was not Mars – it was Venus.,Our knowledge of Venus at the time had been patchy. But as the Soviet probes journeyed down through the Venusian atmosphere it became clear that this planet – named after the Roman goddess of love – was a supremely hostile world. The spacecraft were named Venera (Russian for Venus) and the early probes succumbed to the planet’s immense atmospheric pressure, crushed and distorted as if made of paper.,Venera 3 did make it to the surface – the first craft ever to do so – but was dead by the time it impacted, destroyed by the weight of the air. Venera 4 was also shattered on the way down, but it survived long enough to return the first data from within another planet’s atmosphere. The engineers realised, though, they would have to reinforce still further the spacecraft’s titanium structures and silica-based heat shield.,The information coming in from the Venera probes was supplemented with readings from American spacecraft and ground-based observatories on Earth. Each added to an emerging picture of a hellish planet with temperatures of over 400 °C on the surface and atmospheric pressure at ground level 90 times greater than Earth’s.,Spacecraft can only be launched towards Venus during a ‘window of opportunity’ that lasts a few days every 19 months. Only then do Earth and Venus’ relative positions in the Solar System allow for a viable mission. The Soviets therefore usually launched a pair of spacecraft at each opportunity. Venera 5 and 6 were launched on 5 and 19 January 1969, both arriving at Venus four months later.,There had not been time to strengthen these spacecraft against the unforgiving atmosphere, so instead the mission designers modified their parachutes so that they would descend faster and reach lower altitudes, sending back new data before their inevitable destruction.,Launched on 17 August 1970, Venera 7 made it intact to the surface of Venus on 15 December 1970 – the first probe ever to soft land on another planet. Its instruments measured a temperature of 465 °C on the ground. It continued to transmit for 23 minutes before its batteries were exhausted.,Venera 8 carried more scientific instruments which revealed that it had landed in sunlight. It survived for another 50 minutes. Venera 9, the first of a far stronger spacecraft design, touched down on 22 October 1975 and returned the first pictures from the surface of another planet. It too showed sunny conditions – comparable, the scientists reckoned, to a Moscow day in June.,The surface was shown to be mostly level and made up of flat, irregularly shaped rocks. The camera could see clearly to the horizon – there was no dust in the atmosphere, but its thickness refracted the light, playing tricks and making the horizon appear nearer than it actually was. The clouds were high – about 50 km overhead.,The Soviet Union now had a winning spacecraft design that could withstand the worst that Venus could do. More missions followed, but then in the early 1980s, the designers started making plans for the most challenging interplanetary mission ever attempted.,Scientists around the world were keen to send spacecraft to Halley’s Comet, which was returning to ‘our’ part of the Solar System on its 75-year orbit of the Sun. America, Europe and Japan all launched missions, but the Soviets’ pair of Vega spacecraft were the most ambitious, combining as they did a sequence of astonishing maneuvers, first at Venus and then at Halley’s Comet.,Both crafts were international in their own right, with many nations contributing to their array of scientific instruments. They arrived at Venus in June 1985.,Each released a descent probe into the Venusian atmosphere. Part of it released a lander that parachuted down to the surface while the other part deployed a balloon, with a package of scientific instruments suspended underneath that first dropped and then rose through the atmosphere to be carried around the planet by winds blowing at well over 200 miles per hour.,Meanwhile, the main part of each Vega spacecraft continued on past Venus, using the planet’s gravity to slingshot itself towards an encounter with Halley.,A little under a year later both arrived a few million kilometers distant from the comet. Both were battered and damaged by its dust, but their instruments and cameras returned plenty of information on the ancient, icy and primordial heavenly body.,A golden age of Russian planetary exploration had come to an end.,Russia plans to return to Venus, but meanwhile, its Vega spacecraft, their instruments long dead, continue to patrol the outer reaches of the Solar System, relics of the nation’s pioneering days of space exploration."

an exhibit
in the Science Museum to celebrate her life, a collaboration between the Museum and the Russian State Museum Exhibition Centre, ROSIZO.,That evening the space pioneer attended a gala celebration in honour of her 80
th
birthday.,After welcoming speeches by Ian Blatchford, Museum Director, and the Ambassador of Russia to the United Kingdom Alexander Yakovenko, Dr. Tereshkova was welcomed with a standing ovation in the IMAX.,She referred to her “space sister”, Helen Sharman, the UK’s first astronaut who she supported and encouraged before her launch to the Mir space station in 1991. Sharman was among the VIP guests at the event which included Chair of the Science Museum Group Board of Trustees Dame Mary Archer, Monty Python’s Eric Idle, TV presenter Gia Milinovich, comedian and television presenter Dara Ó Briain, and science communicator Helen Czerski.,Before the gala performance, the audience was treated to a violin recital by Tereshkova’s grandson, Alexei. Then came a screening of Легенда о Валентине (Legend of Valentina), a specially commissioned film of her life, including previously unseen archival footage, accompanied by the Russian Philharmonic Orchestra and acclaimed virtuoso violinist Dmitri Kogan. The event was organized with the
ArtPointFoundation
, represented by Sabina Fatkullina.,Two years ago, Ian Blatchford persuaded Dr. Tereshkova to come to the Science Museum to be
interviewed
and reunited with Vostok 6, the spaceship that had been her home for almost three days, at the launch of the Museum’s blockbuster exhibition
, Cosmonauts: Birth of the Space Age
.,She declared at the time how the blackened craft, wrapped in the tattered remains of its thermal insulation, was “my lovely one, my best and most beautiful friend, my best and most beautiful man.”,Blatchford told those in attendance at her birthday gala celebration last week: “What better time to pay tribute to the achievements of such a heroic and pioneering woman than during Women’s History Month?” He added: “On her last visit to the Museum in 2015 she declared her wish to join me on a space flight, and I look forward to making plans with her this time around!”,She now greets Blatchford like an old friend, giving him a bear hug – “she almost cracked my ribs!” he protested.,Throughout the birthday celebrations, Tereshkova referred to their
joint space adventure
, and how they would sing duets as they ventured forth in a joint mission to Mars.,This would, of course, she explained, be a cooperative mission involving many nations, not a privately-backed adventure.,Doug Millard, Deputy Keeper of Technologies and Engineering and Curator of ‘
Valentina Tereshkova: First Woman in Space’
said “Valentina Tereshkova epitomises the can-do spirit that propels humanity to great things. As the first woman in space and still, the only one to have flown a solo space mission, her story continues to be an inspirational one for millions.”,Following the unveiling of
Tim Peake’s Soyuz spacecraft in January
by the first ESA astronaut, along with a
VR experience
, this exhibition marks another key event in the 2017 UK-Russia Year of Science and Education.,Because of her proletarian origins, Tereshkova was a Soviet propaganda dream come true. Her mother was a textile factory worker and her father a tractor driver and war hero, who was killed during the Soviet Finnish conflict of 1940.,Fascinated by skydiving, Tereshkova joined the local aviation club in her home town of Yaroslavl in 1959, aged 22. After her first parachute jump, she wrote that she wanted to do it ‘every day’.,Inspired by the launch of Yuri Gagarin in 1961, she would sit on the banks of the Volga, dreaming of piloting a spaceship. In the spring of 1962, Valentina Tereshkova was selected as a cosmonaut candidate, by which time she had completed over 120 jumps.,Early one morning, Tereshkova set off for a closed military installation, Star City, near Moscow. Sworn to secrecy, she had told her mother that she was “being recruited to be a parachutist in the Russian national team.”,Gagarin (“we looked to him as a god”, she recalls) would visit the trainee female cosmonauts in Star City to offer them encouragement in what was a boot camp with a gruelling regime, from a centrifuge, nicknamed the ‘devil’s mill’,  to isolation tanks. It was, she recalled, like “renouncing life on Earth.”,Despite the scepticism of male peers, Tereshkova was selected for launch from the original crop of 400 candidates. She described how, after completing her communication and life-support checks in the craft, she felt no fear, only excitement of the kind that electrifies athletes before a competition.,Tereshkova was launched from obscurity to global fame on 16 June 1963. Her Vostok-6 rocket thundered into life at 12.30 Moscow time, after a two-hour countdown.,She recalled how the spaceship rose slowly over the launchpad, like some great creature, as she shouted: “Hey, sky, take off your hat, I’m coming to see you!”,As it accelerated, g-forces began to push her against her seat, making it harder to breathe. She could be heard over the radio chanting her call sign: “Ya Chaika, Ya Chaika” [I am Seagull],Tereshkova orbited t Earth 48 times over three days, logging more flight time than all American astronauts combined up to that date.,Like Gagarin, she had to eject at a height of seven kilometers after the re-entry, during which the exterior of her capsule had heated to 1500 degrees.,After 16 minutes of fiery and turbulent descent, when she was no longer weightless, an ejection mechanism triggered. “I catapulted out of the spacecraft and parachuted down,” she said.,Rather than falling to Earth in Kazakhstan, she had ended up in the Altai region of what is now the Russian Federation. Her heavy parachute, which billowed open at four kilometers, could not be steered as she floated over a lake. “I begged God not to land on water,” she said. “God heard my prayers and allowed me to land on the shores.”,Curious locals started to take an interest in stripping her craft. Tereshkova, who had been bruised by her descent, “showed them my pistol” she recalled and shouted: “leave my parachute alone”. The tense encounter ended amicably. They gave her milk, eggs, bread, and honey. After space, she said, “nothing from a delicatessen can compare” with “simple village food.”,Tereshkova reciprocated by giving the excited locals her cosmic rations, later earning a stern reprimand for disobeying his orders to only eat space food. Even so, she was awarded the titles of Hero of the Soviet Union, Cosmonaut-Pilot of the USSR and the Order of Lenin.,A star was born. Women imitated her hairstyle and fashion. Tereshkova featured in postcards, posters, children’s stories, toys and on T-shirts too.,The ‘modest Yaroslavl girl’ became an ambassador-of-goodwill for the Soviet government. In all, Tereshkova made 42 foreign trips between 1963 and 1970, receiving more invitations than even the great Gagarin.,She fell in love with a fellow cosmonaut, Andriyan Nikolaev, leading to the first ever ‘space marriage’. Their daughter Alyonka, born in 1964, was hailed as the first ‘space baby’.,Tereshkova was also the first civilian to go into space, the Russians and Americans who were launched into the cosmos before her had all been servicemen.,The ‘First Lady of Space’ would never fly again but her mission remains a milestone in pioneering space exploration. It would be another 20 years before the next woman went into space."

The imposing array of switches, lights, knobs and display screens, gives me command of a powerful yet responsive machine. There is a lot of noise from the cooling air blowers, and occasionally the machine emits strange sounds from its loudspeaker indicating the progress of an application program. This is how the original operators of Pegasus would have felt in the 1950s.,,Sometimes an operator would be the person who actually designed and wrote the program, taking hands-on control to ensure the program worked correctly.,Operators became wizards at manipulating the control switches to direct what the machine does, as well as monitoring the binary data shown on the cathode ray tube screens.,While the program was running, they rolled-up any punched-paper tapes to be kept, or glanced up at the clock to write the next log-book entry. There was a pervading feeling of warmth, comfort and order.,The Ferranti Pegasus computer was developed in the early 1950s by a team of former Elliott Brothers Ltd engineers using a technology pioneered in the Elliott/NRDC 401 computer.,The engineering of Pegasus is outstanding. It is assembled from hundreds of plug-in electronic modules about the size of a paper-back book which contain two or three valves (vacuum tubes – pre-dating the use of transistors or
microprocessors
).,Some of these modules are used as the internal memory of the computer but the main memory is based on magnetised spots on the surface of a rotating drum, similar to a modern day magnetic disc drive. Data input and output is via 5-track punched-paper tape. No typewriter keyboard or display screen!,Pegasus was the first “user friendly” computer, and about forty Pegasus systems were sold, between 1956 and 1962. Scores of programmers and users of the machine have commented on the ease of programming and operation.,A fundamental part of Pegasus was a simple operating system, a set of routines called Initial Orders which was stored permanently in a write-protected area of the drum.,Pressing the “Start” key caused the Initial Orders to be executed, and they gave the programmer facilities for inputting programs and data, for debugging, for assembling large program systems from sub-sections and libraries, and so on.,Pegasus and the Science Museum
The Science Museum Pegasus, serial number 25, has been re-located at least eight times in its life, including a period in Sweden. The museum acquired it from UCL London in 1983 and it was initially displayed in Manchester where it was occasionally maintained by a colleague and myself. After a couple of years the machine moved back to London.,When the
Computer Conservation Society
was formed in 1989, a group of expert volunteers re-commissioned and demonstrated Pegasus at the museum. It was put on prominent display in the Computing gallery in 2000, where for the first time in its long life, Pegasus was on view to the public. It is a tribute to the quality of the original engineering that Pegasus survived this repeated stripping down, moving, and re-assembling.,For nearly a decade Pegasus was demonstrated every fortnight, but in 2009 a fault with the machine required it to be shut down and Health and Safety considerations subsequently stopped further operation. This historic, 60-year old computer continues to be an important artefact in the Science Museum’s Computing and Data Processing collections.,Chris Burton is a volunteer at the Museum who helps maintain and run Pegasus, one of the oldest computers in the world. Chris is a member of the Computer Conservation Society.,For more information on Pegasus, read “The Pegasus Story” by Simon Lavington published by the Science Museum. In 2015, the Computing gallery will close, reopening in late 2016 as the new Mathematics gallery.

first non-stop transatlantic flight
, taking off from Newfoundland on 14 June 1919 and crash-landing in a bog in Ireland on 15 June 1919.,Alcock and Brown won the Daily Mail prize for the first crossing to take less than 72 hours and were knighted by King George V.,You can see the original
Vickers Vimy/Rolls Royce biplane
on display in the
Flight Gallery
at the Science Museum and the

toy cat mascot that flew with Alcock and Brown at the
Science and Industry Museum
in Manchester.,The
journey of the Vimy
, however, did not finish in a County Galway bog.,After crash-landing, it was taken to the Vickers factory in Weybridge. There it had to be completely stripped down and cleared of all the mud, before being reassembled.,While the fuselage and larger parts are likely original, many of the smaller pieces of equipment were removed and replaced.,Consequently, quite a few souvenirs exist, made from parts of the original Vimy.,For instance Anne Boultwood, who worked in the erecting and doped fabric department and was the only woman to work on the Vimy, had two souvenirs from the aircraft: a light switch from the fuselage to allow Alcock and Brown to see the instrument panel and a poker made out of the RAF wire used for the rigging.,The Science Museum Group has a
letter opener formerly owned by Alcock and made from the aircraft
.,Bill Montague worked at the
Vickers factory in Weybridge
and was part of the team that helped reconstruct the aircraft for display at the Science Museum.,Supposedly, the names of those that helped reconstruct and move the Vimy are visible on the starboard fin on the tailplane. Though my trip to the
Flight Gallery
did not immediately reveal any.,Conversations between Vickers, the Office of Works and the Science Museum convened shortly after Vickers finished the reconstruction of the Vimy.,As there was no room to store it anywhere, it had to go on display in the upcoming Aeronautics exhibition. Construction on the new gallery was delayed, much to the frustration at times of Vickers, who had to continue storing the aircraft themselves.,Vickers clearly felt strongly about preserving this aircraft, recognising that a museum was its best chance of survival.,P. D. Acland, manager of the company’s Aviation Department wrote in a letter to the First Commissioner of Works, Alfred Mond:,‘…it is essential that an apparatus of this description should be in a good building, in view of the fact that Aeroplanes are liable to depreciate unless properly housed.,Should it be possible to put this machine into one of the principal Public Museums, it would be a permanent memorial, and remain in good condition for a great many years.’,Vickers also felt strongly about the importance and status of this modern aircraft, putting it on par with
Stephenson’s Rocket
, the most significant
early railway locomotive
.,Acland writes:,‘In making this offer, we respectfully beg to inform you that it is our sincere wish, and that of Messrs. Rolls-Royce, that this machine might be housed somewhere in the vicinity of the historic “Rocket”.’,The Under-secretary of State for Air, General John Bernard Seely, however, elevated the Vickers Vimy above Stephenson’s Rocket:,‘I should think it would be a far more interesting relic to succeeding generations than many other things which have been kept, such as Stephenson’s “Rocket”.’,Colonel Parkinson, Keeper of the Machinery and Inventions’ Division at the Science Museum disagreed, writing,,‘It is ridiculous, of course, to compare this aeroplane with the Rocket. I should think that future generations will consider the Henson and Stringfellow and the Maxim models as of more interest than a machine which crossed the Atlantic…‘,After being installed through the windows of the gallery, the
Vickers Vimy
was presented to the nation on the 15 December 1919 during the opening of the temporary Aeronautics Gallery.,A century on and the Science Museum is proud to display the astonishing Vickers Vimy biplane, the first aircraft to fly nonstop across the Atlantic Ocean.,Hugo Massac Buist’s prediction
of what the public would think 100 years on rings true and is an excellent summary of the important
contemporary collecting work
that the museum continues to do:,‘We may think our machinery to-day very perfect and of the finest quality; but only a hundred years hence people will gape in amazement to think we ever got off the ground, far less than we ever flew from
England to Australia
, or from Newfoundland to England, on what will seem to them such crude constructions as those which appear to us to-day to be the very last word.’,See the Vickers Vimy biplane and 9 other significant moments from the history of flight in this

Wounded
exhibition
none have the power to move more than a series of pastel sketches that show the devastating facial injuries suffered by young Allied soldiers.,The drawings bear powerful testament to the dangers faced at the Western Front when heads placed above trench parapets were targeted by low-level gunfire and fast-moving shell fragments.,They also mark an important milestone in medical history, for they stand as early surgical records of the emerging discipline we now know as plastic surgery.,At the heart of the story was an ear, nose and throat surgeon from New Zealand by the name of
Harold Gillies
.,Having seen facial operations carried out in France – while serving with the Red Cross – Gillies led the call for similar treatment to be offered to soldiers returning to England.,He campaigned for the establishment of the world’s first dedicated hospital for facial injuries, which opened in a leafy suburb in northern Kent in August 1917.,This was known as the
Queen’s hospital, Sidcup
, and some 11,572 operations were carried out there before the unit closed in 1925.,As Gillies’ techniques were a new medical discipline much had to be learned through trial and error. His greatest accomplishment was the development of the tube pedicle skin-grafting technique.,In this technique the surgeon separated but did not detach a flap of skin from a healthy part of the soldier’s body, and took it across to the injured area, where it was sewn into place to allow new tissue to form.,Gillies’ colleagues also found a new way of administering anaesthetic to those suffering from facial injury by passing a tube into the windpipe through which ether could be fed directly into the lungs.,This technique remains the basis of anaesthesia today.,Gillies described plastic surgery as a ‘strange new art’ and saw illustration as a powerful tool with which to record surgical procedures and help the surgeon achieve an aesthetically pleasing result.,He worked alongside
Henry Tonks
, a surgeon turned painter and art teacher, who sketched the patients before, during and after their operations. Tonks left Sidcup in early 1918 to take up the role of official war artist in France.,Gillies also realised that 3D imaging could transform the work of the plastic surgeon. A team of sculptors were brought to Sidcup to make plaster casts of the men’s faces.,Artificial ears, noses and chins were added before surgery to show how a soldier’s face might look after the operation.,Kathleen Scott – widow of Antarctic explorer Robert Falcon Scott – was a talented member of the team. An example of a cast can also be seen in the
Wounded
exhibition
.,The press heralded the work at Sidcup as ‘the most extraordinary medical discovery of the age’.,In reality, while great advances were made, many soldiers were left struggling to cope with the psychological impact of living with long-term disfigurement.,Wounded: Conflict, Casualties and Care

The Science Museum’s collection is constantly growing as we discover both historic and contemporary scientific and medical objects. Sometimes people donate their belongings to us, other times we purchase them, and occasionally we find them by sheer luck.,Natasha McEnroe, the Keeper of Medicine at the Science Museum, always has a keen eye for historical objects. While holidaying in Dorset this summer, she saw this charity collection box for sale in an antique shop, and felt it could be a valuable addition to the collection.,However, before we can add anything to the collection, it is really important that we find out as much as we can about an object’s history, including its previous owners, to ensure that we can legally, and ethically, acquire it.,A common sight on British streets throughout the 50s, 60s, and 70s, collection boxes like this one raised money for many different charities.,The first challenge was identifying which charity this box belonged to. Though it had a label, it has since been lost. As the child is wearing a calliper (a leg brace) we expected her to be from a charity that supported children with polio and cerebral palsy, conditions that were often associated with callipers.,We narrowed it down to either Scope or Action, two children’s charities established in the 1950s. After contacting both organisations, Scope confirmed that it was one of their historic collection boxes, though they were unsure of how it came to be in an antique shop. They were kind enough to share the object’s unique history with me.,The girl depicted on the box was called Debra, and she was placed in high streets and outside of shops in the 1970s. She collected money from generous passers-by for Scope, a charity formed in 1952 by three parents of children with cerebral palsy.,Prior to the creation of Debra, many collection boxes were designed to appear realistic and lifelike to promote charitable giving. The most famous example is the collection box that Damien Hirst modelled his ‘Charity’ statue on.,Debra was different. She was designed in a cartoon like style, which signifies a time of changing attitudes towards disability.,Nowadays these boxes are (mostly) a thing of the past. This is due to the work of Valerie Lang, a Trustee of Scope. She was elected in 1979 and made it her mission to,“to get rid of the collecting dolls that the Society had, standing outside shops… [because] they made very little in the way of profit, because people had to go round and empty these boxes, but my main contention was that in an era when the Society was attempting to foster independence, and although I don’t think it was then talking in terms of ‘equality’, it was talking in terms of people having a place in society, and I thought the image of a begging child was not conducive to asking for independence, and a place in society. And to me the awful thing was that each of these dolls, they tended to have callipers on and drooping heads, and outstretched hands, and they were designed to evoke pity, and I thought the day of pity should have gone.”,The Science Museum’s collection doesn’t contain many similar collection boxes, but we do have one from the 1950s that shows a scene from the Pied Piper of Hamelin, created by Action.,In the famous folktale there were 3 children who were unable to keep up with the Piper which, depending on the version you are hearing, may have ultimately saved their lives. One of them is pictured on the left-hand side of the box, just behind the other children. He can’t match pace with the others and is left behind.,,Debra will soon arrive in the conservation lab where our team will check and stabilise her condition. Time has not been kind to her, but we think that the damage to the paintwork around the coin-slots will help us tell her story. She will then become a part of the Science Museum Group Collection and be used to inform our exhibitions, research, and events.,Do you remember Debra? Share your stories with us.,"

The fact that the museum
has
a Classical collection may come as a surprise to some readers; to quote a former colleague’s young son, ‘Planes, cars, trains, and rockets!’ may more readily come to mind when thinking about the Science Museum.,However, the collection does exist and has many interesting stories to tell, some of which will be included in new galleries dedicated to the history of medicine that will open 16 November 2019.,Greek and Roman antiquities made their way into the Science Museum more or less entirely from the enormous collection amassed by
Henry Wellcome
(1853-1936). The great majority were transferred as a
permanent loan
into the Science Museum’s custodianship in the 1970s as part of a larger collection relating to the history of medicine.,Looking at the Classical collection today there is a wonderful mix of ceramics, sculpture, glass vessels, surgical tools and coins just waiting to be discovered.,Amongst the most eye-catching finds is the large number of
anatomical votive
offerings of terracotta and marble which include heads, abdominal viscera, feet, breasts, wombs, genitalia, eyes and ears.,While the exact age and provenance of these anatomical models, unfortunately, remain uncertain, we know that they would have been brought to sanctuaries and shrines in the ancient world to express thanks or request healing or fertility from the gods believed to reside there.,As divine property, the votives were not destroyed or recycled but instead packed into small buildings or rooms, or buried in sacred pits, which is why such large numbers have survived.,Votives were made from moulds and mass-produced, most likely by family-run businesses located near shrines and on the major pilgrim routes. In some cases, the reproductions were modified to show specific pathological conditions or were even specially commissioned to show the specific limbs and features of individuals. You can see the former in this copy of a votive elbow covered in raised pustules below.,Anatomical votives do not only tell us about religious medicine in the ancient world but also of the Roman and Greek understanding of the body and of common ailments and afflictions affecting ancient populations.,In some cases, votive deposits confirm and underline what we know from written sources and other archaeological material, as is the case with for instance eye disease. Partial or complete blindness was a very serious condition in the ancient world as it would have prevented people from carrying out their livelihoods.,Eye conditions, in general, were common and feature prominently in both ancient literature and medical texts. Additionally, votive eyes have been found in large numbers and also feature prominently in the Science Museum collection.,There is a theory that different conditions can be gleaned from the way votive eyes have been depicted. Votive eyes showing eyeballs may indicate conditions affecting vision (e.g. short-sightedness, detached retina, and cataract) while those with eyelids and other surrounding tissues may point to infected lesions (e.g. trachoma or inflammation of the eyelid).,In the ancient world, religious medicine was part of a bustling medical market place where individuals were at liberty to consult different practitioners in lieu of, or alongside, seeking divine help. Any comfort, psychological or otherwise, gained from religious medicine should not be underestimated.,There is also evidence to suggest that healing shrines specialised in for instance injuries to hands and feet, or indeed eyes and that practitioners specialising in treating the above would have set up shop near the shrine, offering their services and wares. Ultimately votive offerings and religious medicine in general needs to be considered when looking at ancient medical practice as a whole.,Ulrika Danielsson was a Content Coordinator at the Science Museum. This and many more exciting stories will be told in the new Medicine galleries opening at the Science Museum in November 2019."

","At the Museum,Science in the news","communication,lates,Lates events,Quantum computers,Quantum computing","Common misconceptions and myths about quantum computing, hailed by some as the next great disruptive technology, emerged during an expert discussion that I introduced in the
Science Museum at last week’s Lates
. This event with UCL’s CompBioMed consortium was held to mark our latest blockbuster exhibition,
Top Secret: From Ciphers to Cyber Security.,These next-generation computers rest on the principles of quantum mechanics, which was developed at the start of the 20th century to describe nature at the smallest scales of energy and matter.,Ordinary or so-called ‘classical’ computers were first put on a mathematical basis in the 1930s when English mathematician
Alan Turing
came up with a mathematical portrait of a universal computer.,Half a century later, it was pointed out that Turing was working with classical physics and that a universal computer based on quantum physics would have greater powers. This would mean that calculations that would take a classical computer longer than the history of the universe could be done in a reasonable amount of time.,The reason it would take so long is that classical computers encode information in the
form of bits
, which can take the value of 1 or 0 (think of them as the currency of on/off switches that ultimately control how a computer works).,However, quantum computers are
based on ‘qubits’
, which can represent both a 1 and a 0 at the same time (quantum mechanics refer to
‘superposition,’
where they are in states that are neither zero or one).,What is remarkable is that while a quantum computer with two qubits could run four calculations at the same time,
a 1,000-qubit device could process more simultaneous calculations than there are particles in the known universe
.,The rapt audience was told by its MC – theoretical physicist, author and broadcaster
Prof Jim Al-Khalili
– that, despite the strangeness of the subatomic world, quantum computing is increasingly making the headlines: ‘Are we approaching the time it is going to become a reality?’,During the event, various myths and misconceptions emerged:,Quantum Supremacy spells the end of normal computing.,News recently leaked that Google scientists had achieved
“quantum supremacy”
, where a quantum computer outperformed a regular computer on an especially hard task.,But the set task tends to be ‘extremely artificial,’ said
Peter Love of Tufts University
, who used to work with D-Wave-Systems, a Canadian quantum computing company. In the case of the Google work they tackled the ‘random circuit sampling problem.’,Although a quantum computer has won a race with a classical supercomputer, the practical implications are minimal, and it remains possible that classical algorithms can sometimes catch up.,Love added that when it comes to the much-disliked phrase ‘quantum supremacy’, ‘that’s a term that pre-dates Donald Trump.’,Quantum Computers can outperform normal computers.,Yes, for certain tasks, but no for other things at which they are ‘utterly useless,’ said
Ian Levy, Technical Director, National Cyber Security Centre.,They will be useful to tackle hard problems like optimisation, such as how to make processes run more efficiently, whether finding the shortest routes for a delivery run, or providing search results from the internet, said
Viv Kendon of Durham University
, who works in the
Joint Quantum Centre
of Durham and the University of Newcastle. ‘They have several tricks that can bypass what classical computers can do.’,,However, both are digital computers and
Peter Coveney Director of Computational Science at UCL
, and a chair at the University of Amsterdam pointed out in a
paper published the day before
that the numbers they rely on are a poor representation of reality.,So neither classical or quantum computers can completely reliably reproduce the behaviour of ‘chaotic systems’, which are commonplace.,Quantum Computers will be commonplace in 20 years.,Pundits have been saying that for the past twenty years, remarked Ian Levy.,Quantum Computers will replace normal computers.,Viv Kendon told the packed IMAX audience that computers are becoming more diverse and interconnected and the future lies in hybrid machines since classical computers remain very powerful: ‘We are not expecting quantum computers to sweep away classical computers.’,Quantum Computers will wreck internet security.,Security depends on hard problems, such as factorisation, finding the two prime numbers that must be multiplied together to produce a third. Using a classical computer to break a 2048-bit key would, based on his assumptions, take roughly the entire UK electricity generating capacity 150,000 years, said Levy.,However, quantum computers with around 100,000 qubits (we can only manage around 50 at present) could do this job in seconds. Ian Levy said that this is ‘kind of cool but really scary’ but added that mathematics already provides new ways of doing cryptography that cannot be cracked so easily by a quantum machine.,Quantum computers can run the same programs that we can use on classical computers.,They must use different kinds of algorithms and, to develop them, computer scientists need more quantum computing hardware ‘to try ideas out’, said Viv Kendon.,Quantum Communication will be important.,Quantum theory, which is deeply counter-intuitive, states that particles can be in two places at once, another example of superposition. Moreover, two particles can be related, or ‘entangled,’ so that their properties are linked, regardless of their relative distance, which some have used for secure communications since they reveal if someone is tampering.  But these only provide links between given points, which is highly restrictive, said Levy.,Quantum computers will be better at modelling the real world.,Yes, when it comes to quantum systems, for instance when it comes to designing materials bottom-up, from scratch, a long-held dream described by Peter Love: ‘We really believe quantum computers can solve that problem.’,However, he added that although classical computing has failed to crack this problem for the past 60 years, scientists lack the proof that they will never be solved this way.,They will be used to help create a ‘digital doppelganger’ of patients, a so-called
virtual human
, to
test treatments and drugs
, said Prof Coveney. However, these simulations of the body will have to work at a range of scales, from the level of atoms (amenable to quantum computing) to the level of organs, where conventional computers can be used.,Quantum machines could become conscious.,Prof Al-Khalili warned the audience before opening the discussion that anyone who suggests that quantum computers, which are somewhat mysterious, can somehow solve the consciousness, itself a notoriously hard-to-define concept, ‘will be taken out and shot.’,Join more discussions like this

Public Health Act of 1848
. But many of these older sites and their modern counterparts – regularly vandalised and expensive to maintain – have closed their doors. Yet while these often substantial buildings still survive, albeit boarded up or changed in use, most of the old simple
public urinals
have long gone.,This is less true in other parts of Europe. Despite the removal of many open urinals (aka ‘pissoirs’), they can still be found.  During my recent holiday in Belgium, referred to
previously

Langemark
. I must admit when approaching it, in need, I assumed the door was round the back. There was no door… just the other side of the wall. I’m not sure where this leaves desperate female churchgoers.,While I’ll put my expectations of an enclosed room down to cultural conditioning, things in Britain have and are changing. A bit.,This final example is also from Bruges. But it could be from London’s West End or other British streets where such portable open urinals are laid on for late night crowds.

Arms, legs and ex-Servicemen
showing our 20th century collection of prosthetic limbs. The history of artificial limbs is inseparable from the history of
amputations
and closely linked to warfare.,This artificial arm was made for someone who had their left arm amputated above the elbow. Many people have commented on how sinister and robotic the arm looks. This is probably because you can see all of the joints in each of the fingers and the wrist. Unlike some modern prosthetics no attempt has been made to replicate the appearance of a hand, just its function – each of the fingers have some movement, the wrist and elbow rotate and move up and down.,A great deal of craftsmanship has gone into the arm. By the beginning of the 1800s, specialist prosthetic makers took over the jobs of making them from carpenters, blacksmiths and armour makers. Some prosthetic limb makers originating in the 1850s such as
Hanger
and
Chas A. Blatchford
are still in business today.,If you want to see the sinister looking arm, it is on display at

Stitch London
to stitch all things science…,Last year the Stitch London crew came to the Museum to create their stitched selves in our
Who am I? gallery
about brain science and genetics.,This year we’re thinking even bigger – Stitch London are going to help us stitch the world’s largest handmade stitched solar system.,Plus they will be creating lots of stitched science specimens – anything from stitched skulls and stethoscopes to James Watt and Einstein. Tiny stitched Professor Brian Cox anyone?,The Stitch London team are already busy stitching away as but they can’t do it all on their own – they’ll need your help. From pom pom planet rings to knitting a giant Jupiter, your skills are needed to help create this piece of art.,Can’t stitch or knit? Don’t worry! The Stitch London experts will be running a number of workshops over both days to help you master the science of knitting. Learn the ‘knitting jenny’ technique, create a Mars martian and discover how to turn a plastic bag into yarn for our planet Earth. Find out

Florence Nightingale
.,Not so with the collections though. During one visit to the stores I came across a curious item: Khaki haversack, belonging to Dr. Caroline Matthews. Intrigued, I started searching through Wellcome Images.,So just who was Dr Caroline Matthews (1878-1927)?,After graduating from Edinburgh Medical College for Women in 1903, Dr Matthews spent most of her time on the continent. We are fortunate enough to have some of her medals for her services during the Messina Earthquake in Italy, 1908 and with the Italian Red Cross.,During the Balkan War of 1912-13, she was war correspondent for the
Sphere
, and held the rank of surgeon in the Montenegro army and was also awarded a medal for her services.,Dr Matthews wrote
Experiences of a Woman Doctor in Serbia
, published by Mills and Boon in 1916, in the middle of the First World War or the ‘Great Upheaval’ as Caroline called it.,The book recounts her journeys through Serbia with the Scottish Women’s Unit, her time as a Prisoner of War and her journey back to London in 1915. Quite possibly my favourite part of the book is her account of stocking up on supplies, with her “English RAMC (Royal Army Medical Corps) ‘Tabloid’ case on which to rely.”  Tabloid was the brand name of Burroughs, Wellcome & Co. Maybe she carried her supplies in the haversack, now sitting in the Science Museum stores?,I’ve been trying to work out why this material is in the collection. It was acquired from a private collection, just five months after her death. I feel a part 2 to this blog coming along….."

‘the discovery of the elements radium and polonium … the isolation of radium and the study of the nature and compounds of this remarkable element’.,Isolating radium from pitchblende was a laborious process, with a ton of ore yielding only a tenth of a gram of the new substance. In the early 20th century radium was a hot commodity, with the world’s small supply in demand for scientific, medical and industrial research. Curie established a Radium Institute in Paris to carry out research into radioactivity and continue production of radium and other substances.,Radium’s reputation as a wonder-substance led to a public craze for radium therapies.

Medical Research Council
’s annual science writing competition after Max Perutz, the distinguished essayist who helped set up Britain’s ‘Nobel Prize factory’, the Laboratory for Molecular Biology in Cambridge and, equally apposite, in 1962 shared the Nobel Prize for revealing the atomic structure of complex biological molecules, notably the haemoglobin that makes blood red (there’s a
model
in our collections).,With my fellow judges Prof Fiona Watt, MRC Executive Chair, and Andy Ridgway, Senior Lecturer in Science Communication at the University of the West of England, it was an honour and pleasure to judge the best of the 116 entries to the Max Perutz Science Writing Award 2019, which represents around ten per cent of council funded doctoral students in the 22
nd
year of the competition.,At a ceremony earlier this week in the Royal Institution, London, the winner of the
2019 prize
was announced, MRC-funded doctoral researcher: Mr Akira Wiberg, of the University of Oxford, who received the first prize of £1,500 for his article: “
Getting on your nerves

I’m hoping to tread a career as a surgeon scientist. I’m currently a plastic surgery trainee but I want to carry on doing my clinical work alongside research and I think communicating my research with the public is very important.”,Runner-up Ms Erin Attrill, University of Exeter, received £750 for “The enemy of my enemy is my friend”. And highly commended, and awarded £400 was Ms Anna Beukenhorst, University of Manchester, who wrote “Smartphones for healthcare research: data at our fingertips”.,Congratulations to the other entries who made the
shortlist
this year:,There is already a great deal of advice for budding science writers (for instance this,
by me
).  Of all the factors that distinguished the top entries from the rest was that they worked harder to intrigue the reader, earning the right to take a deep dive into explanation, while too many entrants were preoccupied with trying to explain the background of their research to get the reader interested in the first place: the latter read more like Wikipedia entries.,Prof Fiona Watt, who chaired the judging panel this year
and last
, said: “Their articles represent the fantastic breadth of research we fund – from discovery research to clinical studies and development of new technologies. Topics include disease prevention, precision medicine and new ways to treat mental health conditions and tackle antimicrobial resistance.,“Using conversational language, relatable anecdotes and personal experiences, the writers grab the reader’s attention, explaining simply and clearly why their research matters. I’m proud to say that previous winners have gone on to win national science writing awards, give TED talks and become BBC presenters.”,Before the ceremony at the Royal Institution, the shortlisted entrants had the chance to attend a science writing masterclass led by Dr Claire Ainsworth, freelance journalist and science writer. The keynote speech of the evening was delivered by Professor Robin Perutz, who said that for his late father: “there was nothing more important than communicating the benefits of science and dispelling the misinformation that surrounds it. He would be thrilled that you as the MRC research students, are out there passing on the message and that the competition still bears his name.”,Next month, to engage new audiences with medical thinking down the ages, the Science Museum will unveil its

Research Fellow Farrah Lawrence-Mackey explores the story of a special Iron Lung she came across while carrying out research in the Science Museum Group stores.","Collections and Objects,Research",medicine,"Daphne burst into tears when she saw the weird-looking box.,‘Come on, Daphne, it won’t hurt you,’ Dr G Emrys Harries, the medical superintendent comforted her as he took her hand. The large wooden object,
an Iron lung
, was used to treat
polio
, a deadly virus that could paralyse chest muscles making it impossible to breathe unaided.,Patients were placed inside these coffin-like boxes so that a vacuum could be formed around their chests, causing their lungs to expand. Air would then be pumped back into the box allowing the users’ lungs to deflate, basically keeping the patient breathing.,These devices still appear alarming to us today; no wonder ten-year-old Daphne was scared at being told she actually had to lie inside it, trapped with only her head poking out of the box.,The ‘iron lung’, or negative pressure ventilator that little Daphne was placed in at Cardiff Isolation Hospital in 1938 had only just arrived at the hospital. Before it was installed, Dr Harries had been very worried about what would happen should a child come to the hospital with chest paralysis. Without a negative pressure ventilator, there was very little that he could do to help these patients. With this in mind, a few months before Daphne became ill, Dr Harries decided to build his own ‘iron lung’ out of wood and other odds and ends.,At a cost of only half a guinea, Harries built a wooden box five and a half feet long, about eighteen inches in depth and two feet wide. He placed the box on a metal bedstead, the joints were sealed and made airtight and a sliding door at the head end (the foot end of the bedstead) was inserted with a circular space for the patients’ head and neck to fit through. A small glass window was inserted near one end for observations and on the top of the box, a large set of leather blacksmiths bellows were fastened, the main expenditure of the project. The bellows had a long handle for hand operation so that the pressure in the box could be increased and decreased as the air was pumped in and out of the wooden chamber. Harries had built a very simple negative pressure ventilator.,When a professionally made metal iron lung was delivered to Cardiff Hospital, the homemade Harries lung was not simply put in a basement to rot. In fact, Harries’ lung was reported to have kept a patient alive for twelve hours a few months after it was built, and it was anecdotally said that the hospital used it up to the 1950s.,As a Science Museum researcher, I came across the articles describing Harries’ efforts with his hand-operated wooden ‘iron lung’ while undertaking my own research.,As I read these articles, I had a light bulb moment. I had seen this object before!,There are many peculiar objects in the
Science Museum Group Collection
, perhaps to be expected considering its acres of storage.,One of these odd objects is a wooden negative pressure ventilator that sits in the basement of the Blythe House object store between
the more conventional ‘Iron lungs’
.,The museum database held very little information about it, but it was known that it was given to the Museum by Cardiff Hospital and that it may have been built in the 1940s and used until the 1950s.,I suddenly realised that I had found not only when this object had been built, but by whom and when and where it had been used.,Historical research is long-winded and can be disheartening, but every so often you can find something quite surprising that suddenly uncovers a trove of information about a previously obscure or bizarre object. This was one of those moments and I am very thankful that my time at the Science Museum has allowed me to experience this."

It is the first DNA fingerprint. Roger Highfield explains more. ","At the Museum,Collections and Objects",dna,"This fuzzy image, taken on 10 September 1984, launched a revolution; one that sent out shockwaves that can still be felt today. It is the first DNA fingerprint, taken on a Monday morning at the University of Leicester by
Alec Jeffreys
, now Sir Alec in recognition of his momentous achievement.,The fuzzy pattern that he recorded on an X-ray film was based on genetic material from one of his technicians, Vicky Wilson. At that time, Sir Alec was investigating highly repetitive zones of the human genetic code called “minisatellites”, where there is much variation from person to person. He wanted to study these hotspots of genetic change to find the cause of the DNA diversity that makes every human being on the planet unique.,Gazing at the X-ray film recording Wilson’s
minisatellites
, he thought to himself: “That’s a mess.” But then, as he told me, “the penny dropped”. In this mess he stumbled on a kind of fingerprint, one which showed not only which parts of Wilson’s DNA came from her mother and which from her father, but also the unique genetic code that she possessed, one that was shared by no other human being on the planet.,In that Eureka moment, the science of DNA fingerprinting was born.,Sir Alec and his technician made a list of all the possible applications of genetic fingerprinting – but it was his wife, Sue, who spotted the potential for resolving immigration disputes, which in fact proved to be the first application.,Soon after his discovery, Sir Alec was asked to help confirm the identity of a boy whose family was originally from Ghana. DNA results proved that the boy was indeed a close relation of people already in the UK. The results were so conclusive that the Home Office, after being briefed by the professor, agreed to drop the case and the boy was allowed to stay in the country, to his mother’s immense relief. “Of all the cases,” he recalls, “this is the one that means most to me.’’,Sir Alec is the first to admit that he never realised just how useful his work would turn out to be: in resolving paternity issues, for example, in studies of wildlife populations and, of course, in many criminal investigations (DNA fingerprinting was first used by police to identify the rapist and killer of two teenage girls murdered in Narborough, Leicestershire, in 1983 and in 1986 respectively).,Similar methods were used to establish the identity of the ‘Angel of Death’ Josef Mengele (using bone from the Nazi doctor’s exhumed skeleton), and to
identify the remains of Tsar Nicholas II
and his family – in the course of which the Duke of Edinburgh gave a blood sample.,Sir Alec told the University recently
: “The discovery of DNA fingerprinting was a glorious accident. It was best summarised in a school project that a grandson of mine did years ago: ‘DNA fingerprinting was discovered by my granddad when he was messing about in the lab’. Actually, you can’t describe it better than that – that is exactly what we were doing.”,Sir Alec
has long been concerned about the world’s DNA databases. He describes how there needs to be a balance between the state’s rights to investigate and solve crime and an individual’s right to genetic privacy. “I take the very simple view that my genome is my own and nobody may access it unless with my permission.”,As for what happens next, Sir Alec says: ‘I’m now retired and consequently busier than ever.’"

",Science in the news,"stem,women in science","As a jubilant
Christina Koch stepped out of her scorched soyuz capsule
in the snowy grasslands of Kazakhstan last Thursday after 328 days in orbit, it felt truly special to celebrate her achievement for the longest continuous space flight by a female astronaut.,Together with Koch’s other world record –  the first women’s spacewalk joint with her fellow NASA astronaut, Jessica Meir
in October last year
, this is a moment for celebration for all women working in space science and STEM.,It was also a moment to reflect on the extraordinary partnership that is the International Space Station – which was Koch’s home for nearly a year. A partnership between the Russian Space Agency, NASA and three other international Space Agencies including the European Space Agency which has benefited our understanding of human space flight since its launch in 1998.,Koch’s time in space marks the latest milestone in a line of pioneering women. From the first woman in space, Valentina Tereshkova in 1963 to the first Briton in space, Helen Sharman in 1991, the legacy of female astronauts is one of defying preconceptions.,Both women went on to continue very successful careers in STEM – Valentina in engineering and Helen in Chemistry. And we were thrilled to reunite them at the Science Museum in 2017 to celebrate Valentina’s 80th birthday.
Hear more from Tereshkova as she recaps her historic journey into space.,Whilst onboard, Koch also conducted experiments including studying the effects of zero gravity on Mizuna mustard greens, bioprinting, combustion and kidney diseases.,And just like Tereshkova, Koch is not just an astronaut. She is also an electrical engineer who has been involved in scientific field work for the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Alaska and other remote locations.,Koch’s record is not only impressive as a feat of physical endurance but will provide a wealth of new data on how the female body responds to zero-gravity conditions. Through missions like Koch’s we are able to right a historical imbalance and enhance our understanding of how long missions will affect women too including the next challenge in human space flight – a five hundred day flight to Mars and back.,In order to find solutions for the challenges that space travel poses we need a range of diverse individuals shaping its development, enabling us to travel further beyond the limits of our world and understand our place in the universe.,The Science Museum Group has a key role to play in inspiring female scientists, engineers, technicians, mathematicians and astronauts that will take us further than we have ever gone before.,In our

German Enigma cipher machine
, first introduced for civilian use in 1923.,The Enigma machine was one of the first machines to use moving rotors and electric circuits to encrypt messages.  In the late 1920s, more sophisticated versions of Enigma became Germany’s main military encryption device.  Due to the massive number of possible encryption settings, the German military believed Enigma to be practically unbreakable.,One of the first countries to try to break into Enigma was Poland.  After the First World War, Poland had regained its independence and quickly realised the importance of codebreaking during the Polish-Soviet War of 1919-1921 when
Józef Piłsudski
, Polish Head of State in the 1920’s and 1930’s, used intelligence provided  to him by a very successful Polish Army’s ‘Cipher Section’ to gain the upper hand over the Russians.,Hundreds of enemy ciphers were broken by a team that included army lieutenant
Jan Kowalewski
and three professors of mathematics:
Stefan Mazurkiewicz
,
Wacław Sierpiński
and
Stanisław Leśniewski
. This ultimately led to the Polish success in the Battle of Warsaw – ‘an enormous defeat’ in the words of Vladimir Lenin.,This Polish victory was built upon – the Polish Army ‘Cipher Section’ became the ‘Cipher Bureau’ and began recruiting civilian mathematicians to study and break the new mathematically complex cipher systems being developed in the 1920s.,In the early 1930s, they hired and trained new mathematicians including
Marian Rejewski
,
Jerzy Różycki
, and
Henryk Zygalski
to generate new code and cipher systems and to study and break enemy code and cipher systems.  They weren’t the only country interested in being able to decrypt and read German forces’ communications, which could provide crucial secret information and offer a vital military advantage.,Polish, French and British codebreakers had all begun attempting to break Enigma in the 1930s.  However, the Poles were the furthest ahead in part because they were able to intercept Enigma messages as soon as the German military started to use.  Thousands of miles away, Britain could not intercept Enigma messages until the Spanish Civil War between 1936 and 1939.,Between 1932 and 1938, mathematicians at the Polish Cipher Bureau broke the Enigma cipher.  Polish codebreaker Marian Rejewski reverse-engineered the inner workings of a military Enigma machine and produced a copy referred to as a ‘Polish Enigma Double’ manufactured.  We have one of two surviving examples on display in
the
Top Secret
exhibition
. Rejewski calculated its wiring by mathematical analysis of encrypted messages, knowledge of a less secure commercial version of the Enigma machine and secret information provided by the French military.,With a looming war on the horizon, and aware that further success depended on international cooperation and money, the Poles decided to share their success, tools and knowledge with other Allies including British codebreakers from Bletchley Park.  In July 1939, Polish codebreakers shared everything they knew about Enigma with their British and French counterparts at a secret meeting in woods near Warsaw, just before Germany invaded Poland and the Second World War began.,Their help was vital for the codebreakers at Bletchley Park. It was the groundwork on which Bletchley Park codebreakers built their efforts to decrypt Enigma messages.  Staff at Bletchley Park, including Alan Turing and
Gordon Welchman
, developed a scaled-up electromechanical version of the hand-operated Polish Bombe machine, a purpose-built machine used to break into German Enigma traffic.,This painstaking work, the sheer power of minds, and international co-operation of British and Polish codebreakers enabled the Allies to routinely break into Enigma from early 1940 onwards and contributed to Allied success in the war.,Further reading,X, Y & Z: The Real Story of How Enigma Was Broken

our Group
on what we are doing to reduce our carbon emissions, as part of a broader conversation that will help us to drive further improvements in our response to this huge global challenge.,In addition to ideas drawn from internal teams, we are in regular contact with experts in a range of fields, from architecture to climate science, to understand more about the evidence and best practice in operating more sustainably.,A key contributor has been our former colleague Chris Rapley, Professor of Climate Science at UCL, who has kindly agreed to join the Science Museum Advisory Board.,By sharing more information through this blog, I know we will spark further conversations that will benefit the public programme in
our museums
and bring fresh impetus to our work on sustainability.,Our sustainability journey to date,Our total energy use today is 43% less than it was in 2001 and 25% less than in 2011/12.,This reduction has been achieved despite growth in the Science Museum Group (partly through new museums joining) that equates to a 24% increase in floor area.,Since 2016 we have purchased all electricity for our museums from renewable sources while energy efficiencies and renewable electricity procurement have led to a 69% emissions’ reduction against a 2011/12 baseline.,Actions that have contributed to the reduction in energy use include LED lighting, plant replacement and embracing passive design such as harnessing natural light and passive cooling.,In addition, we have solar panels at both the
Science Museum
in London and
Locomotion
in County Durham, with more solar panel projects planned as part of our work at the
National Collections Centre
near Swindon, which will all feed directly into our buildings.,The Solar Farm at the National Collections Centre is a mark of our commitment to thinking differently in our approach to sustainability.,Whilst we are not directly operating the solar farm, we view this a vital use of our land. We lease 183 acres of land to an external company for a solar farm, which feeds up to 50 million watts of electricity into the national grid at any one time.,Over an entire year, approximately 50,000 million watts of electricity goes into the grid – almost four times what we use as an organisation – saving 22,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions every year.,Engaging our audiences,We are uniquely placed to engage our visitors with the history of industrialisation and its effects on the environment, including climate change. The stories of
our collection
demonstrate how we got to where we are today and what we can do to solve the problems we now face.,Our programming in the last twelve months has achieved this in original and unique ways. The
Manchester Science Festival
promoted dialogue around plastics, sustainable food and endangered species.,The Science Museum’s ‘The Sun’ exhibition, now
open in Manchester
, explores the story of humankind’s relationship with our closest star and its potential for endless energy.,In York, the
National Railway Museum
’s February Half Term programme focussed on “Energy and Sustainability” and engaged families with recycling and alternative energy. School programmes across Group support environmental curriculum links including power generation, materials and design.,Visitor engagement extends to our commercial offer. The
new retail space
at the Science Museum is an opportunity to lead the conversation on sustainable products.,The retail team are collaborating with innovative company Pentatonic who create beautiful products from everyday waste streams, for example water glasses from smartphone screens.,The newly opened shop also has a display of collection objects along the theme of “re-use” including a
toy helicopter
made of Heineken Cans and a handbag made from recycled rubber tyre inner tubes.,Current priorities,To reduce our emissions further and maintain year-on-year reduction we need a holistic approach which brings together technological solutions and culture change.,We have gaps in our approach that must be addressed, among these the need for sustainable procurement guidelines and a travel plan that covers colleague commuting, business travel and visitor travel.,Our current priorities in improving our approach on sustainability are:,Our work against these priorities is being supported by an internal team of around forty colleagues from across the organisation who act as advocates, support environmental activities and constructively contribute to our approach, through their own unique experience of the organisation.,Progress will be assessed by our Board of Trustees later this year and shared publicly as we continue this important dialogue.,Sponsorship,Some campaigners who care about the issues I have addressed above have suggested that we should also sever our long-standing relationships with several energy companies, such as BP, Shell and Equinor.,This has been the subject of regular review by our Executive team and the Board of Trustees and the clear view has been that such an act would be unwise.,The major energy companies have the capital, geography, people and logistics to be major players in finding solutions to the urgent global challenge of climate change and we are among the many organisations that regard the approach of severing ties as being unproductive.,We believe the right approach is to engage, debate and challenge companies, governments and individuals to do more to make the global economy less carbon intensive.,Through research and technological innovation in areas such as carbon capture, fuel efficiency and alternative energy, energy companies have a major role to play, and we must continue to challenge them to show more leadership to deliver on this potential.,We also achieve public good with the sponsorship we receive from energy companies.,The ground-breaking
Atmosphere Gallery
(visited by 5.4 million people since it opened in December 2010 and publicly praised by Al Gore) would never have been possible without support from Shell.,Thanks to support from Equinor for
Wonderlab
, thousands of young people, from very diverse backgrounds, are inspired to be the scientists and engineers of the future. The same is true of BP sponsorship of
The Science Museum Group Academy
.,I am sceptical about the argument that such sponsorships are greenwashing. It would be much easier for companies to seek a quiet life by not sponsoring high profile institutions, because working with us exposes them to exceptional scrutiny.,Ultimately our visitors can – and do – make their own minds up about our approach.,Finally, it is important to point out that all sponsorships are considered in line with our
ethics policy

Top Secret: From Ciphers to Cyber Security
is the life and death importance of secure communications in the trenches of the First World War.,Here, different methods of signalling were used to communicate and one of the most ancient systems of communication used were carrier pigeons, also known as messenger pigeons.  In the First World War, carrier pigeons were used to send short messages on land, in air, and at sea.  On the frontline, they were mostly used for espionage and for emergency messages, from soldiers and tanks in no-man’s land and when an attack was about to take place.,The use of pigeons as method of military communications dates back over 3,000 years with the earliest recorded use of pigeons in warfare dating back to c.1150 BCE when the Sultan of Baghdad strapped capsules filled with papyrus sheets to the leg or back feathers of pigeons and used them as messengers.,Carrier pigeons were also used over three thousand years ago by the Egyptians, Persians, Greeks, Romans, and others.  Despite the development of optical telegraph signalling systems in France in the late eighteenth century, carrier pigeons remained popular in France.  They went on to prove their worth during the four-month siege of Paris during the Franco-Prussian War in 1870-1871 when, it is said, 400 birds delivered nearly 115,000 government messages and about a million private messages.,Carrier pigeons were well regarded by the British military with a strong and illustrious tradition: carrier-pigeons were used to deliver the news of Wellington’s victory at Waterloo in 1815.  By the outbreak of First World War in August 1914, the military use of carrier pigeons was well established.  However, the British Army did not have a carrier pigeon service, unlike their counterparts in the French and German Armies.,In September 1914, the French Army gave 15 pigeons to the British Intelligence Service and by May 1915 a carrier pigeon service was improvised by the Second Corps during the Second Battle of Ypres.  Shortly afterwards, the Carrier-Pigeon Service was officially founded under the control of the Intelligence Corps and under the directorship of Captain (later Lieutenant Colonel) Alfred H. Osman.  Osman had a long-standing interest in racing pigeons: in 1898, he abandoned his career as a lawyer’s clerk and established and became first editor of
the Racing Pigeon
, a weekly magazine still in publication today.,In his 1928 volume,
Pigeons in the Great War
, Osman described the carrier pigeon service as “practically infallible” and gave an unsubstantiated delivery success rate of 95-99%.  The advantages of pigeons are clear: they could fly silently through the air without indication of place of departure or destination; they did not have difficulties with shellfire or gas, and were remarkably resilient against gunfire while on the wing; they were quicker than runners, mounted orderlies or dogs; they could easily fly distances of over 50 miles; finally, they were more easily replaced than alternatives such as horses or men.,However, carrier pigeons did have some flaws: while they could be released from anywhere without the aid of wires or equipment, they had only one location of arrival – their home roost or loft.  Additionally, carrier pigeons were not necessarily scalable: it took around six weeks to train a carrier pigeon as to where their home roost or loft was located.  Furthermore, pigeons could only be used to carry short messages and so were mostly used on the frontline for espionage and for emergency messages.,Carrier pigeons were used for a new type of espionage: in 1907, German apothecary and amateur pigeon fancier
Dr Julius G. Neubronner
patented a pigeon camera, which was put into limited use for aerial reconnaissance by the German Army during the First World War before they were superseded by aircraft reconnaissance.,Carrier pigeons have also captured popular imagination featuring regularly and prominently in many different forms of popular culture, from page to
screen
and beyond.  Well-known screen outings featuring carrier pigeons in prominent rules include
Disney’s Valiant
(2005) and
Blackadder Goes Forth
(1989), the latter being a personal favourite of this curator.,In the second episode of
Blackadder Goes Forth
, “Corporal Punishment,” Blackadder shoots General Melchett’s beloved pet pigeon, Speckled Jim, who has been called into service as a carrier pigeon and was being used to deliver a message to the trenches.  In reality, carrier pigeons were used to communicate in the opposite direction: to send messages from the front line to pigeon lofts behind the lines from where they were delivered to military headquarters.,While carrier pigeons did have particular successes with the French Army at the Battle of the Somme in 1916, and with the British Army at the Battle of Verdun in 1916, their main area of success was with the Intelligence Service.  By the end of the war, there were over 22,000 pigeons, 150 mobile lofts and 400 personnel serving in the British Army Carrier Pigeon Service and over 100,000 pigeons were used by the British military services during the First World War.,Further reading,Blechman, Andrew D.

was used by Rear-Admiral Richard Evelyn Byrd (1888-1957) on his expedition to Antarctica in 1928-1930. Some of the bandages and equipment are labelled with the words ‘From Little America Antarctica Byrd Antarctica Expedition II Medical Officer’ – Little America was the base camp used for his expeditions. The kit has  hardly been
used.,During the Heroic Age of Antarctic Expedition, ‘Tabloid’ brand first aid kits made by Burroughs Wellcome & Co were given to explorers and influential people packed with the company’s products in a shrewd attempt to promote the product.,Not your average feline,
Sno-cat
was one of four to be used in the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctica Expedition from 1955-8, the first motorised crossing of the continent. It aimed to carry out a complete physical and scientific survey along the route.,The Sno-cat had been originally developed to negotiate very soft snow in North America, so needed a few alterations to survive Antarctica, with its highs of -40°F and powerful snow drifts. This included a special anti-freeze engine lubricant, sealing every hole or crevice and lagging the cabin with inch-thick cellular plastics.,This
Prestwich 35mm cine camera
was used by Herbert Ponting for Robert Falcon Scott’s Terra Nova Expedition to the Ross Sea and South Pole – he was one of the first people to use a portable movie camera in Antarctica. Called a cinematograph, this camera could take short video sequences, helping record the behaviour of large Antarctic animals, like killer whales, seals and penguins. In fact, Ponting’s dedication to his work nearly cost him his life – he narrowly escaped death on one occasion when, attempting to get as close as possible to the action, a pod of killer whales broke the ice on which he was standing. Ponting also took some autochrome plates with him to the expedition and took some of the first known colour still photographs of Antarctica.,A popular choice at the time, the same model of camera was later used by cinematographer Frank Hurley on the Shackleton Antarctic Expedition – this camera, alas, did not survive the trip.,Ernest Shackleton led his first expedition to Antarctica on the Nimrod, with the goal of reaching the South Pole.,The Nimrod was quite a small ship compared to ‘Discovery’ used by Robert Scott, a choice dictated by budget constraints. Despite this, the Nimrod successfully reached Antarctica. Shackleton and his crew were able to carry out a great deal of scientific research, extensively map the area and ascend nearby volcano Mount Erebus (4023m), but eventually failed in their goal of reaching the South Pole. 97 miles away from it, the party of four had to head back, defeated by frostbite, lack of food and the extreme weather conditions.,Shackleton would then go on to lead two more Antarctic Expeditions, the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition (1914-1917) being perhaps the better known one, a feat of heroism and stoicism we still look up to today.,This
Electron capture detector
, a highly sensitive detector for measuring air pollution, was constructed by James Lovelock in 1960.,In the summer of 1967, he measured the air blowing off the Atlantic onto the West Coast of Ireland and and found that it contained chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), now known to cause ozone depletion.
In a partially self-funded research expedition in 1972, went on to measure the concentration of CFC-11 from the northern hemisphere to the Antarctic aboard the research vessel RRS
Shackleton.
These findings helped him elaborate his popular Gaia hypothesis in 1972, in which he proposes that all life on Earth interact with the physical environment and form a complex system which can be thought of as a single self-regulating organism.,(Header image: British Antarctic Survey),Antarctica Live is taking place at the Science Museum every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday between 14 and 30 August 2018."
https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/sir-andrew-wiles-on-the-struggle-beauty-rapture-of-mathematics/,Roger Highfield,Sir Andrew Wiles on the struggle & beauty of mathematics,Roger Highfield explores the beauty of mathematics at a recent event at the Science Museum,"At the Museum,Science in the news","Events,imax,maths","One of the world’s greatest mathematicians, Sir Andrew Wiles, made a rare public appearance in the Science Museum this week to discuss his latest research, his belief in the value of struggle, and how to inspire the next generation.,Sir Andrew made global headlines in 1994 when he reported that he had cracked Fermat’s Last Theorem, so named because it was first formulated by the French mathematician Pierre de Fermat in 1637.,His triumph while working in Princeton marked the end of a long gruelling struggle for Sir Andrew, who first became entranced by the theorem in the early sixties, when he was 10 years old.,Why did Fermat exert such a tight grip on him? The romance of this mathematical story, ‘captivated me’, he said. ‘Fermat wrote down this problem in a copy of a book of Greek mathematics. It was only found after his death by his son.’,Last year, in recognition of his towering achievement, Sir Andrew was awarded the Abel Prize, the mathematics’ equivalent of the Nobel Prize, and today the Royal Society Research Professor of Mathematics at Oxford’s Mathematical Institute continues to explore new horizons in mathematics that have been opened up by his work on Fermat.,After a brief lecture, Sir Andrew was joined by mathematician and broadcaster Dr Hannah Fry of University College London, a familiar face in the Science Museum, having this year presented
Britain’s Greatest Invention
from the museum’s storage facility near Swindon, and been one of the faces associated with the museum’s
Tomorrow’s World
partnership with the BBC, Royal Society, Open University and Wellcome.,Despite his years of struggle, and the scepticism of his peers, did he always believe it was possible to prove Fermat’s Last Theorem? ‘Oh yes,’ said Sir Andrew. “I am always quite encouraged when people say something like: “You can’t do it that way.”’,Did Fermat himself really have a proof? Based on the mathematics of his day, ‘the probability is almost zero,’ though he added: ‘it is just conceivable.’,Sir Andrew realised early on in his attempt on the problem that conventional mathematical approaches had been exhausted but became intrigued once again in 1986 when he realised a new route to crack the problem had opened up in mainstream mathematics, through the study of what are called elliptic curves.,During years of intense study, he placed his faith in the ‘three Bs’: Bus, bath and bed. In other words, the power of the subconscious, when his mind could relax and was given rein to wander.
Sir Andrew is a specialist in number theory, a branch of mathematics dedicated to the study of integers. So, asked Dr Fry, are there other areas of pure mathematics that he wished he had more time to study? ‘I confess that I was addicted to number theory from the time I was ten years old,’ he said.’ I have never found anything else in mathematics that appealed quite as much.’,Dr Fry pointed out that the implication was, of course, that there were other fields of undergraduate mathematics where the Abel prize winner felt he was weaker. ‘Definitely true’, he said.,Even so, he found a way to sate his addiction as a student. ‘There was not much number theory in undergraduate mathematics’ so he would ‘sneak off to the library to try and read Fermat. ‘But Fermat had this really irritating habit of writing in Latin,’ said Sir Andrew. Even today, his grasp of Latin remains ‘minimal’.,Terms such as ‘elegance’ and ‘beauty’ are bandied around by many mathematicians. What do they mean? They are hard to explain but Sir Andrew likened the mathematical equivalent of experiencing the rapture of beauty to walking down a path to explore a garden by the great landscape architect Capability Brown, when a breathtaking vista suddenly beckons. In other words, elegance in mathematics ‘is this surprise element of suddenly see everything clarified and beautiful.’,But you should ‘not stare at it non-stop’, he warned, else the majesty will fade, as is also the case with great paintings and music.,Today he is still walking through the great garden of mathematics, ‘the language of science,’ he said. Another way Sir Andrew described his lifelong passion to the rapt audience was as a ‘beautiful edifice…the most permanent thing there is.’,Industry and government realise that mathematicians are the lifeblood of a modern economy but are concerned by the lack of uptake of maths. Most young people ‘do have a real appetite for mathematics’, said Sir Andrew, but they are put off because, he believes, their teachers are not viscerally interested in the subject.,It is in primary schools that teachers need to kindle sparks of interest in the subject but many of them aren’t actually mathematicians because so many maths graduates end up in better paid careers.,Young people need to learn from someone who truly enjoys the subject, and shows their enjoyment, he said. When the teachers don’t truly care about mathematics, ‘that gets passed on.’ One solution to attracting better teachers, he added, is to ‘pay them more’. His comment was greeted with warm applause.,Is skill at mathematics more a matter of nature than nurture? Sir Andrew disagrees with the depiction of mathematicians in the movie
Good Will Hunting,
which suggests success means being born with an aptitude for mathematics so that ‘it is easy.’,He told the audience that there are some things you are born with that might make it easier but, he stressed, ‘it’s never easy.’,‘Mathematicians struggle with mathematics even more than the general public does,’ said Sir Andrew. ‘We really struggle. It’s hard.’,But, he added, ‘we learn how to adapt to that struggle.’ Intriguingly, he said that some young, bright PhD mathematicians might find it hard to adapt to a life with less instant gratification from solving problems, and ‘can’t cope with being stuck for more than 24 hours’.,To be a great research mathematician, it takes character more than just technical skill. ‘You need a particular kind of personality that will struggle with things, will focus, won’t give up.’,Paradoxically, he suggested that those who are not so good at mathematics are able to cope better with research and the frustration of being stuck.,What is the next great challenge in mathematics? Sir Andrew referred to the Millennium Prize Problems, seven problems in mathematics that were highlighted by the Clay Mathematics Institute in 2000, each with a $1 million prize.,One, the Poincaré conjecture, was solved in 2003. The most famous of the remaining six, and the one that he would bet on to be cracked next, is the Riemann hypothesis, a great unsolved problem identified in 1900 by the highly influential German mathematician David Hilbert. ‘It says something about the way prime numbers are distributed,’ he said.,He encouraged young mathematicians to attempt these ‘impossible problems’ while they are teens or undergraduates, to give them a taste for research, but to set them to one side when starting a career ‘to be responsible.’,The special event was introduced by Martin Bridson, Whitehead Professor of Pure Mathematics, Head of the Mathematical Institute, and by Dame Mary Archer, Chair of the Science Museum Group, who listed various mathematics initiatives in the museum.,Dame Mary pointed out that the museum’s
Wonderlab
interactive gallery has launched a new mathematics show for young visitors, called Primetime, to celebrate the remarkable impact of mathematics on everyday life.,Thanks to the help of Prof Marcus du Sautoy of Oxford, also one of the museum’s advisors, the Bodleian commissioned a carbon dating project of the ‘Bakhshali manuscript’, part of which is
on display
in the museum, which revealed the first written record of zero, a highly-influential number, dates back four centuries further than most scholars had thought.,Since it opened last December,
Mathematics: the Winton Gallery
, has welcomed 1.2 million visitors and won two awards. In the audience was David Harding, who with his wife Claudia donated £5m to fund the gallery, designed by the late Dame Zaha Hadid, to inspire future generations of mathematicians.,Also in the packed IMAX theatre was the TV presenter Dara O’Briain, William Shawcross, Chairman of the Charity Commission for England and Wales, Ilyas Khan of Cambridge Quantum Computing, school teachers and many young mathematicians – perhaps even a future Abel prize-winner or Fields medalist.,"

Star Wars
is very firmly a work of fiction, the films have inspired scientists and enthusiasts alike since the release of
Episode IV – A New Hope

lightsabre
, for example, has long been the subject of various theories and experiments, though an exact replica remains beyond our grasp.,It is also reported that ‘Maria’ from Fritz Lang’s 1927 film,
Metropolis,
was George Lucas’ inspiration for C-3PO. We have a replica of ‘Maria’ in our collection and she is
currently on tour
with the Robots exhibition in Manchester at the
Museum of Science and Industry
. Can you see the resemblance?,,Some current scientific work has rather tenuous links with Star Wars, but is still fun to explore.,Boston Dynamics created a robotic dog, called ‘
BigDog
’, which bears a rather wonderful resemblance to an Imperial Walker. Though as you can see in the clip below It is a bit better at staying on its feet.,‘BigDog’ was created for use by the US military, unfortunately, they were discontinued as they proved too noisy for stealth work, not dissimilar to an Imperial Walker!,﻿,A moisture vaporator is a device used on desert planets such as Tatooine to pull water from the air. Our neighbours at Imperial College London have started a company called ‘ThinAir Water’ which condenses water from the air in even the driest of climates. They use a biomembrane which requires no power, and can be fixed anywhere, to gather and store clean water for local communities.,A Landspeeder is a transportation vehicle which hovered slightly above the ground and could travel at high speeds. Luke Skywalker owned an X-34 landspeeder. A hovercraft was actually first produced before the release of
A New Hope
and we have
the world’s first hovercraft
, SRN1, built by Westland Aircraft in 1959, as part of the collection.,Though initially designed for use over water, not land, hovercrafts are now used over water, mud, ice, land and other surfaces by the military, coast guards and for disaster relief efforts, transportation and sport.,General ownership of hovercrafts is still yet to be realised, though attempts have been made over the years. Recently, Renault and Central Saint Martins held a design competition for autonomous driving, electric power and connected technology. Yunchen Chai created the
winning design
called ‘Float’, an electrical hover car.,A tractor beam is a force field that pushes or pulls objects (mainly ships) in certain directions. The Imperial I-class Star Destroyer, the MC80 star cruiser and the Death Star all had tractor beam capabilities.,Researchers at the University of Sussex and Bristol, in collaboration with Ultrahaptics, have built a
working sonic tractor beam,
which can both push and pull small objects. The technology can now be 3-D printed and used by anyone (with some assembly required). They have begun experiments on using this technology with larger objects like footballs.,﻿
In the films, a cybernetic replacement is a biomechanical device which is used to replace limbs or organs. The limbs would be integrated into the body and were used in the same way as the flesh that was replaced – though they did require some mechanical maintenance. Both Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader underwent this procedure.,In 2015, through
neural technology developments
under the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), a 28 year old, paralysed patient was able to physically feel the touch of each finger of a prosthetic hand, which was connected to his brain. This advancement points to a future where people with missing limbs or who are paralysed would be able to control and ‘feel’ their robotic limbs – just like in Star Wars.,The Star Wars franchise captured the world’s imagination when it was released in 1977. It changed the way that films were produced and gave us a glimpse of what the colonisation of space might look like.,Will be we zipping around, travelling through hyperspace, coexisting with beings from other star systems a thousand years from now?,Some people believe that this is the sort of future that humans need to be striving for. Individuals like
Elon Musk
and
Jeff Bezos
think that inhabiting space is ‘the next frontier’ and Star Wars has helped us earthlings picture just what that might look like."
https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/the-science-behind-your-easter-egg/,a guest author,The Science Behind Your Easter Egg,Isabelle Alaya explains how to become a chocolate chemist.,"At the Museum,Exhibitions and Galleries","chemistry,food,robots","This Easter, we’ve partnered with the
Chocolate Museum
to make our very own Robot Easter Egg. Isabelle Alaya, Founder and Director of the Museum, explains the science behind the process and how you can become a chocolate chemist.,Did you know that in order to make chocolate glossy, smooth and silky in texture it has to be tempered? Chocolatiers have to manipulate the sugar and fat crystals within the cocoa butter by meticulously heating, cooling and agitating its molecular properties so the mixture crystallises into its most stable form. While the process may seem complex, everyone can become a chocolate chemist and temper their own chocolate at home. Here’s what you’ll need:,First, like all good chemists, be aware of your experiment surroundings and your equipment before you begin the process. Chocolate should be tempered in a cool, dry environment, as moisture and humidity can cause the sugar crystals to evaporate, leaving your chocolate with streaks and a gritty, matte texture. Keeping this in mind, make sure all your equipment is dry and shut your windows on a humid day.,Take your saucepan and fill it with two inches of water to create a bain-marie. The trick is to ensure that when you place your large melting bowl over the pan the base does not touch the water, otherwise the chocolate at the bottom of the bowl will heat over boiling point and split, ruining its molecular structure.,Bring your water to a gentle simmer over a medium to low heat, fill your bowl with chocolate, place it over the saucepan, and leave it to melt for at least ten minutes. Many chocolatiers insist on leaving their chocolate to melt for at least one to two hours to completely separate the existing sugar and fat crystals, but letting your chocolate melt for at least ten minutes will still enable you to melt the appropriate crystals and get the shine and smooth texture you’re looking for in tempered chocolate.,As your chocolate melts, the chemical changes in the cocoa butter begin to take place. Cocoa butter makes up 55% of what is extracted from the cocoa bean and its intricate molecular structure is what gives chocolate its enticing aroma and silky texture. Cocoa butter is believed to be made up of at least six different types of sugar and fat crystals each with their own melting temperatures, but only one, Form V (or the ẞ crystal form), is exactly right as it melts at body temperature and has a firm, stable and shiny texture that snaps when set.,Once fully melted, lift your bowl of melted chocolate off the heat. The crystals within the cocoa butter will now be fully separated. Now chocolatiers manipulate the crystallisation of the cocoa butter by controlling its cooling through a process called tempering.,The first step of tempering involves agitating the mixture to ensure that it quickly cools to a temperature between 27-28°C, causing part of the mixture to crystallise in a V formation. After this step, chocolatiers reheat the mixture to 31°C for milk (30°C for white, 32°C for dark chocolate). Through this process an inner grid of stable crystals are formed, leaving the chocolate perfectly shiny and with a crisp snap when broken. To speed up this method, chocolatiers often work on marble which has incredible natural cooling properties.,There is a simpler way to temper your chocolate at home using a process called the ‘seeding’ method. To temper chocolate by seeding you must agitate and cool the mixture by adding solid chocolate and mixing forcibly. It takes roughly an extra third of the amount of chocolate you melted to temper your chocolate perfectly. Check the chocolate’s temperature frequently as you add your additional chocolate in small pieces and mix them quickly into the bowl. Allow them to melt entirely before adding more. When you have reached the working temperature (31°C for milk, 30°C for white, 32°C for dark chocolate), you can start filing your desired mould, dipping, coating or drizzling.,,To check your chocolate is tempered and ready to work with, you can dip a metal teaspoon into the bowl and wait to see how it dries. If the cocoa butter has crystallised into the desired V formation, the chocolate will set with an entirely glossy shine. Alternatively, if you rub the surface of the chocolate it should have a smooth texture that melts at body temperature.,‘Blooming’, a common problem in chocolate making, may occur during this tempering process. This is recognisable by any discoloured grey casting, streaks and spots in the chocolate and is by the fat crystals forming into an unstable crystal formation during the tempering process.,Blooming may also cause your chocolate to be noticeably rough in texture, often caused by high humidity or exposure to moisture. The surface sugar crystals will absorb the moisture and dissolve, after the moisture has evaporated the sugar will recrystallize into a different and larger crystal formation which is grainier in texture. But don’t worry, if this happens you can always remelt the chocolate and start the process all over again!,Happy chocolate making!,Visit

It can sometimes feel like a daunting task but occasionally serendipitous circumstances lead to a great acquisition.,A member of staff from
GE Healthcare
was visiting the
Science and Art of Medicine
gallery of the 5th floor of the museum and noticed that their company had recently developed a new updated version of a piece of kit. Fortunately for us, they offered us a model for the Museum’s collections.,The generator produces a radioactive version of the element
Technetium-99
, used as a tracer in the body. Radioactive tracers are used in
nuclear medicine
. This is the use of radioactive isotopes to diagnose and treat illness. The radioactive element is injected, swallowed or inhaled and the progress is tracked using a gamma camera or a
PET scanner
. The radiation received from a tracer is comparable to that of an X-ray.,Non-radioactive tracers have also been used to image the body. Early versions of tracers include a barium meal drink used with X-rays to show up the guts.,One of the most commonly used tracers is Technetium-99. One of the problems is that Technetium-99 has a
half-life
of only 6 hours. So it is transported with a longer lasting isotope Molybdenum-99. Once at the hospital, the isotopes can be separated. This is done by injecting a saline or salt solution which leaves the molybdenum absorbed on the aluminium columns inside.,The designers at GE Healthcare worked in collaboration with hospital staff including radiographers to find out their needs and come up with a design solution. The model has won design awards from the Design Business Association and has also reduced its carbon footprint in the process."

John Hunter
(1728-1793), the celebrated surgeon, anatomist and
collector
, lies
safely buried
amongst the great and good in Westminster Abbey – not far from the likes of Ben Jonson, David Livingstone and Robert Stephenson.,This was not always the case. For over 60 years, his body lay in the vaults of London’s
St Martin-in-the-Fields
church. Only in 1859, when the vaults were being cleared for public health reasons, were Hunter’s remains reinterred in their current prestigious place.,This transfer was down to the actions of one man,
Francis (‘Frank’) Trevelyan Buckland
– surgeon,
natural historian
, fellow collector and
general eccentric
. Son of William, a leading naturalist and the Dean of Westminster, Frank was a larger than life character whose approach to recovering Hunter’s body was typical. With the help of a few hired hands, he rolled up his sleeves and set to work himself.,Finding Hunter amongst the hundreds of coffins crammed in the vault took two weeks, at the beginning of which even the strong-stomached Buckland had a wobble. His diary for the first day of the search reads, “The stink awful; rather faint towards the end of the business”. But he knuckled down and, ever the collector, couldn’t resist nabbing a few souvenirs while he was there.,Alongside more “Dust of Death” sweepings from the church vault – a second example of which is shown above – Buckland retained some more solid remnants, such as these unusual skull fragments.,But alongside the nameless human detritus, he was clearly intrigued by encounters with known individuals. Twins
Robert and Daniel Perreau
, infamous gentlemen criminals hanged in 1776, appear to have held a particular fascination.,Not content with the skin from the neck of one brother, on which he could still see the marks of the rope, Buckland also retrieved several neck vertebrae – described by another of his hand-written notes.,Surprisingly, such ad hoc ‘body-snatching’ was not so out of the ordinary as there is evidence of other prominent figures acquiring similarly grisly relics when presented with the opportunity. And, given that Buckland only found Hunter’s remains in the second last of the 3,260 coffins in the vault, perhaps he felt entitled to some grisly mementoes from a truly grisly task."

.  Change was not instantaneous, but in 1965 cigarette advertising had been banned on TV and by 1971 health warnings appeared on cigarette packaging for the first time.,In time, smoking would be progressively marginalised – banned from public transport, places of work and finally from
enclosed public places
such as bars, restaurants and pubs.  Truly a spectacular fall from grace.   As a major area of public health, smoking is of great interest to us and its many facets are well represented in our collections.  Here are an eclectic group of objects associated with smoking’s ‘better’ days.,He may have been one of England’s players, but this was surely not the secret of Stanley Matthews’s success.  In this advertisement from 1952, Stanley swears by the cigarette that’s “kind to your throat”.,Ashtrays are one of the most potent symbols of communal, public smoking.  This example was said to be the last branded ashtray from London’s famous
Groucho Club
– the others having been ‘pocketed’ in the run up to the 2007 ban.,Signage can also hint at the changing status of smoking.  This sign tells of a time when it was felt necessary to gently remind visiting smokers of the appropriateness of their surroundings.,Finally, rather than pay out in coins, this arcade game rewarded the lucky winner with a cigarette.  A prize indeed for all those 11 year olds who presumably could access it along with everyone else!  And there were certainly winners.  The flat, dry remnants of chewing gum all along the underside of the game evoke visions of happy punters, swapping one habit for a rather more dangerous one.,"

Medway doble

In the later 1960s when the model was put in a landscape setting of its own as part of the new Shipping Gallery, it turned out there were some problems of scale when it came to the inclusion of both a human figure and a seagull:,In this display showing small craft of the Thames estuary there is a realistic setting for the Medway doble model and as the scale of this model is very different to that of the other two [models in the case], a scale human figure & a sea gull are included. I might add that there was some argument about the size of a sea gull and the Museum illustrator ended up in the
Natural History Museum
with a stuffed sea gull to measure.’ (Bathe, Assistant Keeper, 1961),This model and display has a particular significance for me because I’m originally from Rochester in Kent and know the River Medway very well. I hope you’ve enjoyed my posts on the

During this period, many cities including London were in the grasp of deadly water-borne diseases, including cholera. This object tested for the presence of organic matter and chemical pollutants in water; thereby being a useful tool in the prevention of disease.,This kit came less than a decade after John Snow first argued that cholera was a water-borne disease. Before this time, the medical profession preferred the idea of germ theory, championed by Louis Pasteur who argued that diseases were spread by noxious ‘bad air’.  Fortunately, we now know differently and this knowledge is going some way to educate people and purify drinking water.

Do you have your mother’s green eyes, or your father’s freckles? We’re so used to thinking of physical traits in terms of genes – genes for height, genes for eye colour, even genes for baldness. But new research reveals that your genes are only a tiny part of what makes you, you. In our new display case, Switch To A Different You? – the Science Museum explores the significance of a groundbreaking discovery.,,Genes make up only around 2% of your

. So what’s the rest of it for? We used to think that most of our DNA was junk – but it isn’t. Scientists working on the Encyclopaedia of DNA Elements project – called
ENCODE

Your DNA is, in effect, a gigantic, dynamic, dancing switchboard.,What does this mean for science – and for our sense of identity? If our genes are such a small part of our DNA, then why do we look the way we do? How does our childhood environment influence the behaviour of our genetic switchboard?

, the Victorian mathematician and inventor spent much of his life designing calculating machines, first the Difference Engine, and then in later years, the Analytical Engine that bear so much resemblance to modern computers. Unfortunately, Babbage never got to see any of his machines built. After quarrelling with the government his funding dried up and he couldn’t afford the costs of construction. All Babbage could do was endlessly refine his plans for the engines.,Apart from a few test models, which are
on display
in the Science Museum, technical plans are all Babbage left of his inventions.  The Museum – which holds the Babbage archive, the most complete collection of Babbage’s technical drawings and notebooks in the world – used these plans to build
Difference Engine no. 2

Visitors will now be able to compare Babbage’s own drawings to the modern model of the Difference Engine in the Computing gallery.,The plans of the Analytical Engines show the many similarities between it and our electrical computers although it was designed over 170 years ago. The engine has a memory, a central processor, an input device in the form of punched cards that could program the engine and a printer. Instead of modern day circuit boards and silicon chips, a combination of cams, clutches, cranks and gears would have worked out calculations.,The most iconic plans of the Difference and Analytical Engines will be on display in the

This winter, we’re performing our well-loved Festive Physics Christmas show, in which you can find out how reindeers can fly, why you might not like Brussels sprouts and what makes crackers crack. We have also developed a screen-printing workshop for families, to accompany our snowflake-making event, Snow and Tell.,As I’m sure you can imagine, lots of work goes into developing events for the thousands of visitors that come through our doors over the festive season, and we’re always looking to reinvigorate our workshops. In Snow and Tell, families try to make it snow in the Museum by creating unique paper snowflakes to take home and hang on their Christmas trees. The workshop is always fun, but we felt the
science behind snowflakes
was getting lost in the blizzard!,We thought introducing
screen-printing
as part of the workshop would make it appeal to a wider age range, and that it could also provide a creative way for people to take the science home with them.,As people tend to retain information well through rhyme, we composed the key messages as a poem:,Each snowflake starts off with six arms
But cold or heat or wind or calm
Can change the patterns that they make
So every single snowy flake
Is just as different as you and me
Yet they have perfect symmetry
And now you know how snowflakes grow
So see the science in the snow!,We then started designing different prints, incorporating the poem and snowflake images that we hoped to screen-print into a lovely A3 poster. Once we settled on a design, it was time to get our hands dirty and try out the
printing process
. BUT as soon as we tried it we realised you need long arms, and a fair amount of strength to press the ink through the screen and produce a clear A3 print! As our workshops are for families, we decided that a smaller A5 print was the way to go, and, as it is the appropriate season, it would be best taken home as a greeting card!,Unfortunately, the design we had settled on had too much text to print clearly on a smaller canvas. After some brainstorming, we decided that because real snowflakes are often too tiny, or
melt far too quickly
for us to get a good look, it would be wonderful to give our families a chance to see them up close. The amazing team at
Screen Grab
present workshops at our
Lates
events, and we knew that they could expose detailed macro photographic images of real snowflakes onto screens that we could then use to print the front covers for our cards.,In the final design, our snowflake science poem was printed on the inside of the greeting card; with a blank front cover ready for visitors to screen print the beautiful macro photographic images of snowflakes.,We’d love for you to join us in making own snowflake greeting card, or at any of our other
festive events

various times

Woburn Abbey
, and the
Science Museum
went head-to-head in a curious battle. They had decided to experiment with a pioneering new technology known as the radio-guided tour and both were eager to be the first to launch the scheme to visitors.,The pair were neck and neck as scripts were written and new equipment installed. The Museum’s director, David Follett, noted how it would be ‘a feather in our cap’ if his team could beat the Duke. With a team of expert curators, technicians and an in-house workshop on-hand to troubleshoot any technical issues, it was not long before a tour was prepared for the Museum’s Iron and Steel Gallery.,The Duke, distracted by other events, would take another eight months to produce his own tour for the State Apartments at Woburn Abbey. So the Museum won the battle, toasting its success with a special press event.,The start of radio-guided tours at the Museum marked an important point in the history a very familiar feature at museums, galleries and heritage sites: the humble audio guide.,Researching the radio-guided tour,During my PhD at the University of Nottingham, I took an in-depth look at the development of the radio-guided tour at the Museum. In the history of audio guide technology in museums, this technology has been often overlooked. However, I was less interested in technological novelty, instead investigating the role of sound and sound technology in shaping the experience and interest of visitors to the Museum.,One of the things I discovered was a connection between the radio-guided tour and a type of exhibition display, or rather an ‘exhibition landscape’.,It might seem strange to refer to a museum exhibition as a ‘landscape’ as opposed to an exhibition space. Yet during the 1950s and 60s, ‘landscape’ described a new kind of exhibition layout aimed at a growing number of visitors with a general interest in the Museum and its exhibits.,The term ‘landscape’ in exhibition design speak referred to the picturesque in eighteenth century landscape painting. Outside the Museum during the post-war years, a new generation of exhibition designers had revived the picturesque to shape their designs for commercial displays, trade shows and international exhibitions.,Commissioned by the Science Museum, exhibition designer V. Rotter – one of the lead designers at the 1951 Festival of Britain – used the technique of ‘exhibition as landscape’ for the Iron and Steel Gallery. Internally too, the Museum’s curators picked up on the principles of the picturesque.,Its key principles included contrast – in scale, colour and texture – and the elements of concealment and revelation. Each was deployed to engage visitors and evoking emotions such as awe and wonder. Gradually this new approach replaced an older kind of display at the Museum, the taxonomic approach, which had row upon row of glass and mahogany showcases.,During my research, I discovered that it was these newer galleries that were selected to host the radio-guided tour. By studying the written scripts for each tour, I discovered the automated commentaries helped visitors interpret individual exhibits and navigate the exhibition landscape.,So whilst the Science Museum and the Duke of Bedford vying for the accolade of pioneer of the audio guide is an amusing thought, the issue of who won or lost wasn’t the focus of my research. Instead, I set out to question how and why the sound was used in the Museum as a space for learning, and I discovered a key connection between sound and a very particular kind of museum display. What fascinated me about the radio-guided tours was how the technology brought sound and landscape together to help an ever-growing number of museum visitors interested in science and technology.,Where were the radio-guided tours installed?,These tours were installed in the Iron and Steel Gallery, Electric Power, Sailing Ships and Acoustics galleries in the Science Museum.,How did the technology work?,Each tour comprised of a tape player, a radio transmitter and a set of portable radio-receivers. The tapes were fed via a radio transmitter to an induction loop antenna fixed to the ceiling of the exhibition space. The output from each tape – a vocal commentary and occasional accompanying sound – was then picked up by visitors on the ground via
hand-held radio receivers
. The receivers, also known as
‘lorgnettes’
could be hired from the Museum’s bookstall at a cost of one shilling and a refundable deposit of ten shillings.,What happened to the tours?,In the end, a little like the Duke of Bedford, the Museum became distracted by other pressing matters. The modernisation of exhibitions during the 1950s and 60s put the whole Museum in a constant state of flux and change. The regular reordering of exhibits meant that commentaries quickly became obsolete and re-recording was expensive and time-consuming.,The construction of the
new Centre Block
, which opened in 1963, also created a lot of unwanted noise making the commentaries often difficult to hear. A host of technical failures didn’t help either, nor the occasional light-fingered listener taking off with a radio receiver! The scheme was abandoned in 1964 just four years after its launch.,Where is the equipment now?,A tape player, magnetic tape and a handful of ‘lorgnette’ radio receivers now reside in the Science Museum’s stores at Blythe House.,Dr. Jennifer Rich is a Cultural Engagement Fellow at the University of Nottingham.

Human Longevity Inc
(HLI) to change the nature of medicine with big data, also the subject of a museum exhibition opening in July, Our Lives in Data.,HLI is analysing human DNA with the world’s largest DNA sequencing facility, which decodes a human genome every 15 minutes. In addition, it will study
microbiomes
, the DNA of gut microbes, which play a key role in health and gather data about phenotypes: patient behaviour, physiology, and anatomy, notably with MRI body scanning.,Using machine learning and spending $1 million every month on cloud computing to analyse these data, Dr. Venter wants to make
a decisive shift in medicine, from treatment to prevention
.,The Science Museum audience was held spellbound by his account of a series of dramatic case histories in which HLI diagnosed rare conditions, provided advance warning of disease and helped customise treatments.,They were also given a demonstration of how DNA can be used to predict eye colour, facial features, skin tone, height, age and more. He added: ‘We think we can predict, fairly accurately, when you might die.’,Dr. Venter has a record of innovation which dates back to the 1990s when he came up with a nimble way to find genes, then unveiled the first complete DNA sequence of a free-living organism, the bacterium
Haemophilus influenzae
.,He became global front page news in June 2000 when his privately funded company Celera unveiled its first human genome alongside the publicly funded version in the White House. In 2007, he published the first complete genome of an individual human – his
own genetic code
.,He set up the
J. Craig Venter Institute
, which has the first
carbon neutral lab
in La Jolla, and co-founded
Synthetic Genomics
, a firm dedicated to using modified microorganisms to produce clean fuels.,He described to the audience how he left his signature in the form of a
DNA watermark
in the world’s first synthetic organism, even its URL and email address, and has also ‘changed the software of life to change the species’.,,Dr. Venter recently figured out the
minimal number of genes
to create an organism with just 473 genes, of which one third are of unknown biological function. He has launched a competition for students to adapt this minimal cell, ‘recapitulate evolution’ and see who can ‘add the biggest evolutionary step.’,Earlier Science Museum Group Director (SMG), Ian Blatchford, told the distinguished audience about the year’s highlights for the Science Museum, which was the
most Googled museum on the planet
in 2015.,They included opening of the world’s oldest horological collection, the
Clockmaker’s Museum
; hosting 4,000 schoolchildren to
count down to Tim Peake’s launch on his Principia mission
; and the news that the museum’s exhibition about particle physics,
Collider
, has now been seen by more than half a million people on its world tour. “I joked at the original opening that we would show how ‘achingly glamorous’ particle physics can be and so how appropriate that the final venue will be the dashing Museum of Tomorrow in Rio.”,He announced the transfer to Moscow of
Cosmonauts: Birth of the Space Age
, which was described by The Times as the ‘best space exhibition ever’.,Treats to come include the most comprehensive exhibition ever on
Robots
, launched with a
Kickstarter campaign to rebuild an iconic British robot
; the new
Mathematics Gallery
, designed by late and great Dame
Zaha Hadid
and the next generation of science learning galleries with £6m of investment – most of it from new corporate supporters. ‘There will be joy in physics, engineering and (for the first time) in maths and chemistry too,’ he said.,After SMG Chairman, Dame Mary Archer thanked Dr Venter for his speech and awarded distinguished guests Science Museum Fellowships.,The first is Professor Dame Ann Dowling, Order of Merit, the first female professor in Cambridge’s Engineering Department, and the first female President of the
Royal Academy of Engineering
, which has worked with the museum on
Engineer Your Future
– seen by over 700,000 people since it opened in December 2014.,The second is Dr.
Helen Sharman
, now at Imperial College London, who also notched up two remarkable firsts when, in 1991, she became the first Briton to go into space and the first woman to visit the Mir space station. Helen will be marking the 25
th
anniversary of her flight
next week
.,Dame Mary also told the audience about our own Northern Powerhouse – our museums in Manchester, Bradford, and York. Manchester will create a major new gallery – Cottonopolis – to tell the story of Manchester as the world’s first industrial city.,‘In July we’ll be opening a nano-sized exhibition –
Wonder Materials
– exploring the potential of graphene, the extraordinary two-dimensional material identified at the University of Manchester by Nobel Laureates
Andre Geim
and Kostya Novosolev.’,Dame Mary said the headline news of the year for National Railway Museum (NRM) was the triumphant return of Flying Scotsman to the rails after a ten-year programme of restoration. Further north, the NRM at Shildon also had cause for celebration with its two millionth visitor, “quite remarkable after only eleven years of operation of a museum that was expected to get a modest 40,000 visitors a year.”,“Meanwhile, more visitors are coming through the door at our National Media Museum in Bradford, where a much clearer focus on STEM subjects – science, technology, engineering, and mathematics – is enabling us to explore our collections in new ways.“,The MC of the event was the SMG Director of External Affairs Roger Highfield and other guests included Trustees David Willetts, Lords Grade, and Faulkner, Professor Dame Athene Donald; Ms Sharon Flood; Professor Russell Foster; Anton Valk and Dame Fiona Woolf.,Also present were photographers Jonathan Anderson and Edwin Low; Sarah Main of the Campaign for Science and Engineering; double Oscar-winner Paul Franklin; Marcus du Sautoy of Oxford University; Gail Cardew of the Royal Institution; Astronomer Royal, Lord Rees; Howard Covington of The Alan Turing Institute; cage fighter Jack Kreindler; Lucie Green of the Mullard Space Science Laboratory; and John Womersley of STFC.,The Science Museum Group is grateful for the opportunity to recognise and thank our funders and partners.,"

Power UP
, a hands-on, fully interactive gaming event which features the very best video games and consoles from the past 40 years.,This inspired the Families and Accessible Programmes team to brighten up our summer events programme with a brand new free family workshop called
Game On
.,We wanted our workshop to be available to as many people as possible so long programming sessions designing video games were out of the question. We were also aware that visitors to Power Up will have already spent a lot of time in front of screens so we decided that we wanted our workshop to be more tactile.,Therefore, rather than our visitors designing a video game, we thought they could design a gaming controller. As part of the workshop you get a blank cardboard shape of a gaming controller to decorate, colour in and embellish as you see fit.,But what fun would a cardboard gaming controller be if we couldn’t get it to work? How could we use these cardboard creations to, say, play a game of Pac man?,Enter
Makey Makey
!,Makey Makey is a little invention kit that includes a Makey Makey board, alligator clips, and loads of possibilities for fun! These tiny, accessible circuit boards can turn everyday objects into touchpads when connected to a computer. We use them to bring our cardboard gaming controllers to life by connecting them to the foil-covered buttons on the controllers.,At our first
Game On
workshops everybody had lots of fun creating beautiful gaming controllers. Families played Pac man and the
bongos
using their controllers and some even connected themselves and their parents to the circuit which meant they could play the drums by high-fiving each other!,Bring your family and join us for Power Up and Game On at the Science Museum and show off your creative and gaming skills.,Game On will be running at the Science Museum from 25 July – 7 August (excluding 6 August).

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/robots-coda-to-coda/,Coda to Coda,Robots: The Making of an Algorithmic Soundscape,,At the Museum,,"When
Coda to Coda
were commissioned to create the soundscape to the
Robots
exhibition at the Science Museum it seemed like the perfect opportunity to think about the relationship between music and machines.,Back to basics…,Much of what we think of as ‘musical’ nowadays is the result of the feedback between musicians and instrument makers. To take an obvious example, the piano is an embodiment of both a mathematical and physical solution to the concept of musical harmony. Without it and the many scholars and craftsmen who evolved both the tuning and mechanism of the piano over centuries, much of what we now take for granted in Western music would not exist.,The
piano’s mechanism
also invites us to consider the possibility that something other than human fingers might also play it. Through this contemplation of the mechanics and possible mechanisation of musical instruments, the question ultimately arises as to why music is still almost exclusively made by humans for other humans. This was not a question that was lost on the clockwork virtuosi of the 17th century. A notable example are
Jacques de Vaucanson’s
musical robots, the first of which was a life-sized flautist who could play 12 melodies and are perhaps the most celebrated. The capacities of these clockwork machines shocked and amazed their audiences and set us on the road of ever more complex simulations of our own human attributes.,Fast forward to the 21st century…,We live in an time where music making is more mechanised than ever. To pick one example among a vast number, we are all accustomed to hearing the voices of singers corrected by a computer so as to have perfect pitch. Indeed Cher’s hit song
‘Believe’
from 1998, through its extreme mechanical warbling, might perhaps be said to have consolidated the idea that popular music’s relationship with technology is symbiotic.,The production of sound and music via mechanical means therefore describes unique and diverse narratives in the annals of technologisation. This is something we wanted to try to both explore and impart to those visiting
Robots
. For this reason we conceived of the soundscape for the whole exhibition as a mechanism in its own right – a musical robot that would run behind the scenes and animate the spaces with sound and music that not only illustrated the sound worlds of the eras the exhibition documents, but also the mechanical processes and constructs that underscore them.,Thematically, the exhibition moves from the dawn of clockwork mechanisms through the mechanical repetition and sequencing of the industrial revolution to the embedded synthesis and logic of electrical circuits up to the evolution of general computation and embodied intelligence. The soundscape not only attempts to describe these themes sonically but also to enact compositionally.,,,In the beginning… Marvel,After an opening preface of the automaton baby, the exhibition soundscape begins with ‘Marvel’; a world of untempered, microtonal melodies and numerous polyrhythmic clockwork pulses which are gradually coalesced into something that gives the illusion of music. Disparate rhythms begin to weave together, out of dissonance harmony is articulated. At its peak the soundscape sounds less like a set of mechanical elements and more like a composition, allowing us to perhaps glimpse in musical terms what the makers of the clockwork automata on display revelled in creating as physical objects.,Dream…,A similar methodology is applied throughout the exhibition. Each era of the soundscape is composed and programmed in such a way to foreground some of the most pertinent technological developments of the time and their repercussions for sound and music. In the ‘Dream’ section of the exhibition we are introduced to radio and electronics and their impact on sound and music. We focus not only on the impact in terms of broadcasting and sound synthesis, but also ways in which ‘tuning’ in and out of signals and the harnessing of random numbers as elements to be used in musical composition effect our perception of what might constitute music.,,Imagine…,As we enter the ‘Imagine’ section of the exhibition and the present day and beyond, our focus shifts to digital technologies, their amorphousness and ability for mimicry and extrapolation. An array of 18 speakers immerses visitors in the current and imagined sonic landscape that issues from the
internet of things
that increasingly surrounds us; a crowd of human synthesised voices, a chorus of synthesised birds and a habitat of phrases from the likes of 3D printers and digital communications made audible.,At the end of the exhibition and in contemplation of
‘iCub’
a humanoid robot about the height of a 5 year old designed for research into cognition and learning development. We attempt, metaphorically, to return to the theme of ‘Marvel’ by deconstructing an algorithmically generated chorale in the style of
Bach
via the techniques of contemporary electronic music. In this way we aim to make reference both to the sense in which research in
music A.I.
predominantly relies on a constrained set of musical examples on which to assess its output and conversely how many experimental music producers continue to develop the eclecticism and meta-narratives of musical expression using the same technology.,,,Robots: The Exhibition Soundtrack

The sculptural designs for our new mathematics gallery set a new standard when it comes to crystallising abstract mathematical thinking into beautiful physical forms.”,Her diverse portfolio of work includes the
Aquatics Centre
that she designed for the London Olympics and China’s Guangzhou Opera House.,Dame Zaha said, ‘I am very proud to be awarded the Royal Gold Medal, in particular, to be the first woman to receive the honour in her own right.’,The new Mathematics gallery at the Science Museum has been made possible by the largest individual donation ever made to the museum from long-standing supporters of science, David and Claudia Harding.,At the launch of the gallery with the Hardings, Dame Zaha expressed her excitement at being a part of the project as ‘it connects ideas of complexity and curvature with science making it a science installation instead of an art installation.’,Dame Zaha was also the first woman to receive the
Pritzker Architecture Prize
, once again defying traditional and stereotypical expectations of what woman can achieve in architecture and science.,During a visit to the Science Museum, Dame Zaha talked about the battles woman face when pursuing science and mathematics, compared with men, with women comprising only 21% of full science professors (according to the US National Science Foundation).,She
noted
how her success has been an inspiration to young women: ‘when I go out to give a talk somewhere there are many girls who come to me. They want to be reassured that they actually can break that barrier and also do it with confidence.’,Next month the museum will celebrate
Ada Lovelace Day
(13
th

last year
, the practice is several centuries old, as quickly becomes evident when thumbing through back issues of the oldest journal dedicated to science.,Philosophical Transactions
, which celebrates its 350
th
birthday on 6 March, has plenty of evidence of citizen science that dates back long before the 20th century, before the internet put terabytes of data at our fingertips, long before TV and long before even  the term ‘scientist’ was coined in 1833.,Three centuries ago, in 1715,
Edmund Halley used Philosophical Transactions
to ask colleagues to help him observe a total solar eclipse, prompting observers from all over the country to respond.,When in 1749, crowds gathered in Green Park in London to watch the great firework display of King George II, a 20 year old Fellow of the Royal Society,  Benjamin Robins, published an appeal in the
Gentleman’s Magazine
to ask people to help record this spectacle of the age, which he reported in
Phil Trans
.,Due in great part to the complex instructions devised by Robins (citizen scientists take note), only one report was sent in, from a Welshman some 140 miles away who couldn’t see individual fireworks, but upon seeing flashes, reckoned that the pyrotechnics were a waste of money.,Creature surveys date back a long time. When Charles Darwin was developing his theories of evolution he browsed popular natural history magazines and sought out information from an army of almost 2000 correspondents (a
project
to compare this approach with today’s citizen science  is now under way by Chris Lintott and Sally Shuttleworth at Oxford, with Gowan Dawson in Leicester.),The Audubon Society’s Christmas Bird Count, which began in 1900, is but one example of a long-standing tradition which has persisted to the present day. Butterfly counts are another example, with schemes starting in the UK and North America in the mid 1970s.,Various wildlife surveys were also conducted by MegaLab, a project that began with the BBC and Daily Telegraph in 1995, using mass media and phone lines to earn the ‘mega’ prefix. Some projects were citizen science in the strict sense defined by the OED (‘‘scientific work undertaken by members of the general public, often in collaboration with or under the direction of professional scientists and scientific institutions’). Others invited a broader form of citizen engagement, where a mass audience provided test subjects to further understanding of the human body and mind.,The first experiment, which was in the latter category, was conducted with Prof Richard Wiseman of the University of Hertfordshire. We used national television, radio and press (BBC1’s Tomorrow’s World, BBC Radio One and The Daily Telegraph, where I was science editor) to test whether it is easier to detect lies in print, radio or TV.,A million call attempts were made but, due to overload, we only recorded data on 40,000. In the journal Nature, Richard Wiseman reported that the radio listeners detected the lies 73.4% of the time, the newspaper readers 64.2% and the television viewers 51.8%.,MegaLab and its successor, Live Lab, continued to do dozens of mass experiments, from counting stars to measure light pollution to studying the
Mozart effect
, working with popularisers, such as Simon Singh, Raj Persaud and Andrew Cohen, and doctors and scientists, from
Simon Baron Cohen
to
David Perrett
and
Jim Levine
. Other papers emerged from the experiments, for instance this
survey of the extent to which Antipodean flatworms had invaded the UK
, and one by Richard Wiseman on
public participation,The web extends the reach of scientists engaging with citizens, and in many different ways. One was to harness idle computer processing power, as with
seti@home
, which helps look for extraterrestrial intelligence, or a
DIY climate forecasting project
that I launched in The Daily Telegraph.,The web could also help reach out to an audience. MegaLab used the web to conduct
Turing tests
, for example, and there are many more examples of internet based projects, such as
Galaxy Zoo
, which asks for help in classifying images of distant galaxies, and the
fold.it
site, which runs a game to fold the structure of selected proteins as well as possible.,The web also allowed an
intelligence test
to be undertaken worldwide in 2010 by
New Scientist
, which I edited at the time, with Adrian Owen, now at the University of Western Ontario, and colleagues. Some 110,000 people took part and the findings
challenged the idea of IQ
and led to a paper in the journal
Neuron
.,Another substantial citizen science project –
#hookedonmusic
– was created by computational musicologists at the University of Amsterdam and Utrecht University. The project has been run by Wellcome Trust public engagement fellow Erinma Ochu and the
Museum of Science & Industry
, Manchester to investigate the science of songs which may have implications for future research into dementia. To date there have been 175,000 players of #HookedonMusic, reviewed
here
, across 199 countries and research papers are expected based on its findings.,The range of citizen science is expanding. To prove that you don’t have to be an adult to do original science, children from a Primary School in Blackawton, Devon, published the results of an experiment on how bees forage for food in different coloured flowers in the Royal Society journal
Biology Letters
in 2010.,Working with Royal Society Research Fellow,
Beau Lotto
, they came up with a question, made simple observations about simple phenomena, and discovered  ‘bees use a combination of colour and spatial relationships in deciding which flower to forage from.’ Gratifyingly they also discovered that ‘science is cool and fun.’ Lotto also ran a laboratory at the Science Museum from late 2010 to the spring of 2012 called, appropriately enough,
Lotto Lab
.,The museum, through its
Lates
and
Live Science
program, has offered many other researchers a chance to experiment on the museum’s three million plus visitors each year. Subjects tackled over the past 15 years range from face scans for surgeons in Great Ormond Street Hospital to gait analysis with Oxford Brookes,  synaesthesia with Sussex, and risk-taking with UCL.,Various papers have been published as a result of experiments on visitors, for instance on
self recognition
and also the way
groups behave
and
crowd behaviour
, explored in our
ZombieLab
event. We are currently running a taste experiment (you can take part
here
) devised by food scientist Charles Spence from Oxford University, with the support of chef Heston Blumenthal.,Citizen scientists can now build and operate their own instruments to gather data for their own experiments or as part of a larger project. There are
robotic telescopes
that they can operate. Nasa gave one group
permission to attempt to activate a 35 year old satellite
. They can contribute to
mathematics projects
too.,And, no doubt, a range of new technologies, such as cheap open source computing power from the Raspberry Pi and Arduino, drones and 3D printing, will aid the long, remarkable and productive rise of the citizen scientist.,The Royal Society is

We know the public relies on museums for accurate information. We also need great journalism more than ever before. We need fabulous science too. We all have our work cut out for us.”,“Can it really be a quarter of a century since we held the very first Scientists meet the Media party, here in the Museum?” added Highfield, who recalled how the very first was attended, among others, by playwright Tom Stoppard, Nature Editor John Maddox, Daily Telegraph Editor Max Hastings, and Judith Hann of Tomorrow’s World, and addressed by the then president of the Royal Society, Sir Michael Atiyah.,Julie Maxton, Executive Director of the Royal Society, told the party that the expression, “may you live in interesting times” has never been more relevant  than today, given the recent “political drama.” She emphasised that, whatever some commentators may be saying, there “is still a place in this world for facts.”,Maxton highlighted several scientific milestones: the birth of the first so-called ‘three-parent baby’ and the green light given by our regulators to offer the procedure in the UK; approval for the use of gene editing (CRISPR-Cas9) in human embryos;
Google’s DeepMind
beating professional Go players; prosthetics with sensations;
gravitational waves
and “we even had a Royal Society event about Machine Learning at the Royal Festival Hall where touts were selling tickets for a higher mark-up than for Adele at Wembley.”,Sarah Sands, Editor of the London Evening Standard, described how she had just walked through
Information Age
in the Museum and was “so moved to be reminded of the birth of global news” – the first message being sent across the transatlantic cable in 1858 “the start of a golden age in newspapers, before Facebook swallowed us all.” She added that the Evening Standard was adapting, rather than dying.,She was also pleased to see eminent snail geneticist and former Telegraph columnist
Steve Jones
at the party and congratulated him on his new book, The Ladybird book of Evolution and remarked that he now sits alongside the Prince of Wales “in the pantheon of great scientists who have written Ladybird books.” The series will be featured in
January’s Lates
.,Perhaps, she mused, the two species of scientists and journalists could cross-breed. “Scientists could sum up their work in a sentence, and journalists could wait 20 years before publishing their stories.”,She also referred to the

lights up the skies. This year’s display promises a good blaze, weather permitting, as there’s no interfering moonlight.,The meteor shower occurs as the Earth passes through debris from
Comet Swift-Tuttle
and

burn up in our atmosphere. It gets its name because the radiant, the point in the sky the ‘shooting stars’ seem to come from, is in the constellation of
Perseus

Cassiopeia

great meteor of 1783
was made, there was still debate over whether meteors originated in the Earth’s atmosphere (‘meteor’ comes from the Greek for ‘in the sky’) or from space.,By the time of the
spectacular 1833 appearance
of the Leonids, another annual shower, it was becoming apparent that the celestial streaks had an astronomical origin. Some decades later,

third installment
in a series of blog posts where we have been exploring the lives of our ancestors by looking at a collection of tool bags from the Science Museum’s collections. This time we will be looking at the mining industry. We might think we’re fairly familiar with the tools of the mining trade, with the Davy lamp and pickaxe especially being mining icons. But do you know what kind of instruments mining engineers would use?,,Mining engineers played (and still play)  an important role in the consultation of almost every stage of a mining operation. They first analysed the potential of a mineral deposit, and then determined the profitability of a mine.,When the minerals had been successfully extracted, this mineralogical test kit was used to perform a mineralogical analysis in order to identify mineral species and understand their characteristics and properties. In order for a substance to be classified as a mineral it had to pass a series of tests, and this kit contains the tools needed for mineral testing, including a blowpipe, tweezers and chemicals.,The flame test indicated the identity of the substance being tested by the colour of the flame it produced. For example, a potassium compound burns with a lilac flame. Blowing through the blowpipe over a candle providing a heat source produced a tiny area of intense heat on a charcoal block, and created the right conditions for separating metals from their ores. After the process of mineralogical testing had taken place, this Tutton’s goniometer for cutting, grinding and polishing minerals may have been used. It was manufactured by Troughton and Simms, London c. 1894, and designed by Mr. A.E. Tutton.,,"

Explainer
at the
Science Museum
is the wide range of work we get the opportunity to do. So as well as working with the public in our interactive galleries and performing
science shows
on a daily basis, sometimes we get to do something a little bit different. A few Sundays ago, David and I had the opportunity to do one of these different things, in this case, 6 minutes of live television.,Channel 4’s
Sunday Brunch
, a morning magazine show, invited us along to do a segment about bubbles. This was a great opportunity for the Museum to promote our
Bubbles show
which we perform throughout the year at weekends and we were about to perform a lot more over the half term. We, of course, leapt at the chance.,What was really nice for us was the level of input we had over what we did, which was pretty much free range. After a few phone calls and emails with the production team at Princess Productions and working alongside our press office, we sent through what we thought would fill 6 minutes. It included a brief introduction to why bubbles have a role in science and science communication (Name-checking
Thomas Young
and
Charles Vernon Boys
), an experiment for viewers to try at home, some experiments they wouldn’t be able to do at home and our popular finale, the human bubble; A bubble so big, you can fit a human inside it. The week of the show, we discovered that the human we would be using would be Kelly Jones, lead singer of the Stereophonics along with one of the presenters, Simon Rimmer.,It was an early start on Sunday morning, the show starts at 9:30, but for rehearsals and set up we arrived before 8. After setting up and meeting the presenters for a “Block” rehearsal, where the camera crew can work out where they need to be and what they will be filming, we basically had to wait until our slot at about 11:00. We watched the show while the nerves built up, I think David was probably more relaxed than me, but I kept thinking about all the things I could say or do wrong in front of the 700,000 strong TV audience!,The segment itself went really well, David had the trickiest bit as he needed to get a paperclip to sit on the surface tension of a small bowl of water. We had prepared some already in case it went wrong, but, ever the professional, David did it on the first attempt. The demo worked really well and we followed it with some carbon dioxide filled bubbles, but had to skip our intended helium filled bubbles as we were running short on time, what with it being live, so moved straight on to the big finale.,As soon as the item finished, the presenters and main crew had to run off to the next area of the studio to continue the show, but the extra crew, along with families of the crew and guests, made a beeline for our table and had a good play with our experiments. We gave them carbon dioxide bubbles to hold and put them in the human bubble until everyone was satisfied, then we headed back to the museum.,We had lots of great feedback from the crew, our colleagues and the public via the Twitter feeds for both the
Museum
and Sunday Brunch. All in all a great experience, interesting, exciting and just a little bit different.,Explainer Fact:

Medical Research Council
(MRC) celebrates 100 years of life-changing discoveries. The MRC has its roots in the National Insurance Act, passed by Parliament in 1911. At the turn of the last century, TB was as great a concern to the Edwardians as cancer is to us today. Desperate for cures, government proposed that one penny per working person per year should be taken from their national insurance tax and put into tuberculosis treatment and research. We would call it ring fenced funding today. By 1913 it was recommended that this research should be extended to all diseases. An advisory council and executive committee was convened to oversee this research and administer funds — and thus it was that the MRC was established.,And what a 100 years it has been. You can read about some of our outstanding achievements on our
Centenary Timeline
including the 1916 discovery that rickets is caused by a lack of Vitamin D, the 1933 finding that flu is caused by a virus, the
unravelling of the structure of DNA
by MRC researchers in 1953, and the invention of the
MRI scanner
in 1973. Our scientists also invented
DNA fingerprinting
in 1984 and helped Parkinson’s disease patients with deep brain stimulation in 1995. More recently we have developed the phone app Txt2stop which doubles a smoker’s likelihood of quitting.,Although it’s great to look back, MRC-funded research continues to have a huge impact on health both in the UK and globally. Less well known is the profound impact that this research has had on our economy and society. We want to share these successes and our birthday celebrations with the British public who today continue to provide the funding for our research through their taxes.,So far this year we have hosted an installation at
Imperial College London
looking at the past, present and future of science; saw Her Majesty The Queen open the new building for the
MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology
(51 years after opening the original); and revealed that antibiotics won the public vote in our
Centenary Poll
on the most important medical discovery of the past 100 years. We’ll be celebrating our official birthday on 20 June with our
Centenary Open Week
, which will see more than 60 public events taking place around the country.,To launch Open Week we are offering a ‘teaser’ of MRC research by joining forces with the Science Museum to host
The Life Game
– a free festival taking place this weekend. Visitors will be able to enter Life and take their character (
pal
) on a journey through the years talking to our scientists, taking chances and making choices as they progress through the festival, creating the story of a long and healthy life for their character.,Visitors will be able to meet scientists to find out about how friends and family can affect health; ground-breaking research on the brain; the impact of living in different social and physical environments; antibiotic resistance; the allergens that can be found by exploring inside a giant nose and how a disease outbreak can spread. People can also gain an insight into how MRC research is helping to improve the lives of transplant patients, and find out how they compare to other visitors in our health tests.,To celebrate the centenary of the Medical Research Council, visitors at the Science Museum were given the chance to create a pal and take them through a unique life journey.

Science and Technology Select Committee
, Andrew Miller MP, has held evidence sessions outside Westminster, notably in Sheffield for its “bridging the valley of death” inquiry into the commercialisation of research and one in Falmouth to take evidence for its inquiry into marine science, so more people can attend without the need to travel to London.,The Committee now wants to uncover what the
public understand about climate
, where they look for their information and how their understanding may impact policy.,Today Mr Miller and fellow MPs convened in the
Atmosphere gallery
of the museum – which has explained climate science to more than 1.7 million visitors since it opened in 2010 – to take evidence as part of its inquiry into
Climate: Public understanding and policy implications
.,‘This is a first,’ said Miller, referring to how the museum is an appropriate location for the inquiry, given its efforts to communicate climate science to a broad audience. The Science Museum has more than three million visitors each year, 37% which are children aged 15 or under.,Among the witnesses was former Science Museum director, Professor Chris Rapley, now of University College London, and Dr Alex Burch, the museum’s Director of Learning.,‘For our visitors, this subject is complex, with an emotional element, and can be overwhelming,’ said Dr Burch.,Dr Burch explained that ‘Various lines of research, for instance at the museum, suggest that for many people climate change was something that happened elsewhere, to other people and in the future.’,The Atmosphere gallery, which has a carefully designed narrative, has been visited by leading figures, including Al Gore, the Chinese Ambassador, and a delegation of MPs from India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.,Prof Rapley called the gallery ‘atmospheric’ and ‘unique’ and said it is aimed at everyone, not just the converted, so they can make up their own minds. ‘It is not the job of the museum to tell people what to think.’,In evaluation surveys, visitors described the gallery as ‘interesting’ (88% of surveyed visitors), ‘enjoyable’ (79%) and ‘educational’ (76%).,To accompany Atmosphere, the museum launched a
three-year programme
of schools outreach around climate science in 2010 with the
National Railway Museum
in York,
Museum of Science and Industry
in Manchester,
At-Bristol
science centre and the
Catalyst Science Discovery Centre
in Runcorn, which has engaged 3,193 secondary-school students with issues of climate science and its communication, notably through a magazine called Atmos.,The museum has also undertaken more unusual initiatives: an online education game about risk management,
RIZK
, which has been played 3.3m times since launch;
A Cockroach Tour of the Science Museum
, a participative art piece by Danish collective Superflex, where visitors explore the Museum and human history and society from the perspective of cockroaches; and Tony White’s e-novel
Shackleton’s Man Goes South
. White was present at today’s hearing in the gallery, which features his book.,The museum’s qualitative research with adult visitors suggests that understanding of climate science is patchy and disconnected, findings backed by other research, such as a nationwide survey conducted a decade ago by the Economic and Social Research Council which showed, for example, that 44 per cent of the public believe (wrongly) that nuclear power directly contributes to climate change.,Research suggests that while the public generally trust scientists as a source of information about climate change, there is evidence that negative stereotypes of scientists (such as poor communication skills and remoteness) hamper direct public engagement with researchers.,Research indicates an important role for trusted institutions such as the Science Museum that occupy the interface between the scientific community and the public. ‘We are trusted by the public, and by scientists,’ said Dr Burch.,In recognition of hypocrisy as another potential barrier to trust among the public, the Museum undertook various measures during the development of Atmosphere, which include employing a Sustainability Consultant, and setting up a Working Group that reduced the organisation’s carbon footprint by 17% between 2009 and 2010.,The Science Museum Group’s new Hemcrete storage facility at its Wroughton site
recently won
a Museum and Heritage’s Sustainability award and the Best Workplace New Build category at the Greenbuild Awards.,The Group also aims to generate energy both for our own use, and to send it to the grid. An example of this is the proposed 40MW solar array at the
Wroughton
site which will provide electricity for around 12,000 homes."

this
link to a small synthesizer hidden in a book.,The synthesiser is a bought piece of equipment, but it’s designed to be hacked and modified by whoever uses it and this particular owner probably had a good reason to keep it hidden. Or he just thought it would be fun to stick a synth in an old book.,Either way, this quirky instrument instantly reminded me of one of the objects in our collection: the Shozyg, invented and built by electro-acoustic musician Hugh Davies.,It is one of many electronic instruments designed by Hugh and made with unconventional materials. He called these instruments Shozygs. This is one of the first Shozygs Hugh made and, like the tiny synthesiser, it is also hidden in a book. It is built into a volume of the New World Library Knowledge Encyclopaedia covering words starting with the letters Sho- to Zyg-, to be precise. It inspired Hugh to come up with the quirky name Shozyg for this instrument and those that were to follow.,I’m not an expert when it comes to identifying electronic parts, but a surprising number of them seem strangely familiar to me when I look at the Shozyg. Squares of foam that could have been part of a sofa, blades of a fretsaw, a spring that looks very similar to the kind you find inside some pens.,Like so many other instruments I came across when working on our exhibition about the history of electronic music, it doesn’t look much like an instrument at all.,This made me wonder, what would the Shozyg have sounded like? After a bit of digging around I found
this video
of Hugh playing the Shozyg before it became part of the Science Museum’s collection.,After Hugh passed away, many of his instruments were given to the Science Museum by his widow. Sound recordings of his work can be found in the British Library.,Some of the Hugh Davies Collection is currently on display in our exhibition Oramics to Electronica: Revealing Histories of Electronic Music. I particularly like his toolbox. It reminds us that so many electronic musicians, past and present, use their creativity not only to play existing instruments, but also to imagine new ones. Whether you call it hacking or making do with what you’ve got, it’s certainly inspiring.,Oramics to Electronica: Revealing Histories of Electronic Music can be found on the second floor of the Science Museum until December 2012."

is one of a
number of ‘Tabloids’
that the Science Museum Group cares for. Medical kits bearing the company’s ‘Tabloid’ brand were given to famous expeditions to promote the company’s products.,The expeditions included the first
non-stop transatlantic flight
(and earlier
transatlantic balloon flight
), an
Antarctic expedition
, and an
expedition to climb Mount Everest
.,I had the opportunity to research this first aid kit and find out more about the round the world flight while completing an
inventory check
as part of an
ambitious project
to reveal more than ever before of our incredible collection.,It became clear to me that Silas Burroughs and Henry Wellcome were right to choose the American air team as one of the recipients of their Tabloids.,The crew had quite the adventure in the months that followed and would have generated the international publicity the two businessmen were hoping for. It was the ultimate product placement.,The crew took off from Seattle, Washington and travelled 30,000 miles, making 74 stops along the way, on a journey that would last 175 days.,The team travelled in four aircraft: Seattle, Chicago, Boston and New Orleans
.
It was by no means a smooth journey and only Chicago and New Orleans completed the entire trip.,Just 24 days after take-off, the team encountered dense fog and strong winds which caused Seattle to crash into the side of a mountain in Alaska.,While the aircraft was destroyed, the two crew onboard fortunately survived the crash and were found ten days later wandering the Alaskan wilderness.,This unfortunate episode was not the only obstacle to befall the intrepid adventurers, who survived several mechanical failures, crash landings, and even a stowaway journalist!,All the more important would this first aid kit have seemed to the airmen in light of such dangers.,The kit
was housed inside an aluminium case and canvas satchel. It contained a variety of bandages and dressings as well as medicines for pain relief, antiseptic, and upset stomachs.,Upon their return, the crew autographed the first aid kit and presented it back to Burroughs Wellcome and Co. as a gift.,Promoting their products through such expeditions was a shrewd marketing move by the pharmaceutical company.,The 1920s saw a heightened interest in exploration and adventure among the general public, in part due to the significant advances in aircraft technology that had been achieved during the First World War.,The world was beginning to seem smaller and exploration of it more feasible.,Experiences like those of the eight people who flew round the world 96 years ago would have captured the public’s imagination as they waited to find out the fate of the crew, or even to greet them in person when they landed.,A number of Tabloid medical kits are on display in

air thermoscope
, which I wrote about a recently. The alternative design shown below was in use from the 1600s. As the air in the vessel expands and contracts water moves up and down the spout, indicating changing atmospheric conditions.,Before air pressure was understood, the instrument was sometimes called a
perpetuum mobile
– perpetual motion – because the water level fluctuated with no known cause.,The English physician and mystic Robert Fludd (1574-1637) interpreted the weather glass as a ‘key to two worlds’. For him, it was a microcosmic symbol of the universe and a model for the human body. Others claimed that it could predict the weather days, weeks or even months in advance.,By the 1660s leading experimental philosophers, who had recently begun to distinguish between temperature and air pressure and to use the thermometer and barometer respectively to measure them, tended to dismiss the weather glass since it responded to both variables.,However, it remained attractive for domestic use due to its simplicity, and portability: one maker claimed in 1917 that his was ‘More Sensitive than the Most Perfect Barometer’.

opens with a
flurry of exciting events
. Which means that we’re getting to the best part of exhibition work – after all the planning, the objects are finally starting to make their way onto gallery.,That’s sometimes easier said than done when your objects
come from CERN
. A few are so large that we’ve had to install them on gallery early and build the rest of the exhibition around them. First up was the object we call The Beast, a 2-tonne section of one of the giant dipole magnets that keep the LHC’s particle beams on course.,Thankfully it was only a section – a whole LHC magnet weighs in at 35 tonnes and is 15 metres long. And our basement gallery is a lot easier to get to than a tunnel 175 metres below ground, the challenge faced by CERN as they
upgrade the LHC’s magnet system
.,Another 2-tonne behemoth, delivered from CERN that morning, followed – an accelerating cavity from LEP, the
Large Electron Positron collider,
which previously occupied the tunnel that now houses the LHC. The copper cavity, used in the first phase of LEP operations, looks like something Jules Verne might have imagined.,Of course, being the Science Museum, we’re used to big bits of kit. The LHC objects, although hefty, were a piece of cake compared with
getting the planes in
. Or handling the 4-tonne
Rosse Mirror
, which we moved into its current position in
Cosmos & Culture
in 2009.,Made of speculum, a mixture of copper and tin, the Rosse Mirror is six feet in diameter. It is one of the few surviving original pieces of the largest scientific instrument of its day, the enormous telescope built by the Earl of Rosse at Birr Castle in the Irish midlands and known as the  ‘Leviathan of Parsonstown’. The mirror was donated to us in 1914 – here it is being delivered.,There’s a clear distinction between ‘doers’ and ‘watchers’ in this photograph. On
Collider
this week I was definitely the latter. As those keen observers of the museum world, the Ministry of Curiosity, point out,
curators rarely do the actual muscle work
.,So, rather than take my word for it, why not ask someone who really knows about moving big bits of particle accelerator around? Lyn Evans (
or ‘Evans the Atom’ as he’s dubbed in the press
) was Project Leader for the LHC build. Next Wednesday 30 October, thanks to our friends at the
London Science Festival

Einstein’s? Marie Curie’s perhaps?,True, all these had quite a lot to offer in the grey matter department, but when it comes to offering the world a clearer picture of the human brain and providing vital insights into the formation and storage of memories, the prize goes to a man by the name of Henry Molaison.,In 1935, 9 year old Henry got in an accident with a cyclist in his home town of Hartford, Connecticut; he hit his head and later developed intractable epilepsy. In 1953 at the age of 27, in an attempt to correct his seizures, he was referred to William Beecher Scoville, a neurosurgeon at Hartford Hospital, for treatment. At that time, neuroscience was quite rudimentary and the procedure carried out on Henry was unprecedented. Scoville removed both temporal lobes of his cerebral cortex and a sea-horse shaped structure called the hippocampus. That’s quite a lot of brain tissue gone.,,Brain model- green sections indicate the Temporal lobes removed by Scoville,The operation succeed in dissipating his seizures, but unfortunately he emerged unable to form new memories. They had removed a part of his brain that was responsible for storing short term memories! Neurologists refer to this state as profound amnesia.,He lived the rest of his life this way, remembering events that occurred before his operation and unable to form new ones after it. He knew  his mother was Irish and also about World War 2, recalling almost nothing after that. Luckily for the world of neuroscience, Henry wanted to help people and gave himself to neurological research for the rest of his life until his death in 2008.,Before Henry Molaison (or
Patient HM
as he is often known to psychology and neuroscience students), memory was an abstract idea, now, thanks to Henry and his brain, we can see where long and short term memory areas are formed in the brain.,,Section of HM's brain indicating where tissue was removed,Had Henry not being so willing to help science to better understand the human brain, many people may not have received the treatment they needed to help with their conditions.,How do you feel about donating your body to Science?,Can you think of any reason that would prevent people from doing so?,Would you donate your pet’s body to science?,If you would like to see and hear elements of this fascinating story, visit the Who Am I gallery on the first floor in the Wellcome wing of the museum.,–

https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/joules-spiders/,Trilce Simila,Joule’s Spiders,,Collections and Objects,chemistry,"Before my first visit to the Science Museum’s stores, I’d imagined having to search for my mysterious magnetic instruments in the midst of much dust and cobwebs in the warehouse from the closing scenes of
Citizen Kane
.,In the rather more ordered and hermetically sealed rooms of
Blythe House
, the spider threads I found were of a much cosier sort. Encased in their own tiny frame, they rather reminded me of my great-grandparents in their wedding portrait.,The two cocoons of Diadema spider silk are surviving samples of the types used in the dip circle designed by James Prescott Joule. (Yes, that Joule.),As scientists became more interested in magnetic phenomena in the late eighteenth century, more effort was made to improve the apparatus used in their study. The friction of pivoted needles found in many magnetic instruments was a problem limiting the accuracy and ease of making measurements.,The usual method involved the needle’s cylindrical axle rolling on agate planes as it aligned itself with the surrounding magnetic field.,Joule turned to spider threads to create an alternative suspension method. JD Chorlton examined one of Joule’s dip circles after the latter’s death, describing it as follows:,“The needle, constructed of a thin ribbon of annealed steel, weighing 20 grains, is furnished with an axis made of a wire of standard gold. This axis is supported by thread of the Diadema Spider attached to the arms of a balance suspended by a fine stretched wire. The whole is hung by a wire which can be twisted at the head through 180°”.,Strong, resilient and light,
spider silk
sounds like an ideal material. In practise the silk was too fiddly, and the needle’s weight and friction with the axle meant that the thread would be prone to snap. Still – it’s a lovely story which gives a sense of the patience, precision and ingenuity required of scientific investigation."

optical telescope
operated by NASA and ESA. From its orbit, around 550km above Earth, it has captured unprecedented views of celestial bodies near and far, from distant, ancient galaxies to the planets and moons of our own Solar System.,On 24 April 1990, Hubble was launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida, USA, and ever since that day it has allowed scientists to make groundbreaking discoveries that help to unravel the secrets of our universe. Though this date marks the start of its mission, the history of the Hubble Space Telescope reaches back further than you might expect.,The concept of a telescope in space can be traced back to a German scientist in the early twentieth century, named Hermann Oberth. In 1923, Oberth published
an article
speculating that one day, we could position a telescope in Earth’s orbit.,At that time, his ideas were considered flights of fancy, but then in 1946, an American astronomer named Lyman Spitzer published
a scientific paper
explaining the advantages of a telescope outside of the Earth’s atmosphere. People did start to take this idea seriously, but it wasn’t until much later that technology would catch up with these space-age ideas.,It was the
technological success of the V2 rocket
that made people realise that the once-lofty ideas of Oberth and Spitzer might be achievable.,Originally developed for use in the Second World War, the V2 became the first man-made object to reach space in 1944. This achievement
paved the way for modern rocket technology
and is considered the first step towards putting a telescope into space.,In 1957, another milestone was achieved: the launch of the first artificial satellite, Sputnik. Sputnik was a
Soviet satellite about the size of a beach ball.
It was launched, in October 1957, into a low elliptical orbit where it continuously circled the Earth 1,440 times during its three-month mission. Sputnik’s success proved that putting man-made objects into orbit was possible.,In 1977, a team at NASA were given the green light from US Congress to begin the Large Space Telescope programme, as it was then called. Astronauts began training the following year, and construction of the telescope’s main mirror, which focuses light gathered to form an image, commenced.,The building of the telescope was a collaborative effort; ESA had been invited to collaborate on the project and different components and instruments were manufactured in sterile facilities across Europe and the USA. The project was later renamed the Hubble Space Telescope in honour of American astronomer Edwin Hubble, who was the first
to identify galaxies outside of our own Milky Way in the 1920s.
By 1985, construction of the Hubble telescope was finally complete.,After completion, Hubble was scheduled to launch in 1986. However, this was delayed due to the
Challenger disaster.
Tragically, the seven astronauts onboard the Challenger space shuttle lost their lives when the orbiter broke apart shortly after take-off. All scheduled shuttle launches were then postponed until it was deemed safe to continue the programme, in 1988.,On 24 April 1990, the space shuttle Discovery took off from Cape Canaveral with the Hubble Space Telescope on board. The telescope was released into orbit the following day, beginning a mission that would span more than 30 years, surpassing all expectations. Thanks to Hubble,
scientists have made some amazing discoveries
; from determining the age of the universe to understanding the birth and death of stars.,The mission continues today, as scientists from all over the world continue to explore the vastness of space through the Hubble’s aperture, hoping to solve even more cosmic mysteries."

It is a universal language across different countries and cultures and it is also deeply personal. Everyone has their own favourite tunes, songs that make their mind drift off into daydreams or remind them of a particular time in their lives.,We wanted to start a piece of research that explored what happened when we listen to music we like, or more accurately how our brains respond to music even if we claim not to like it!,But what really happens in our brain when we listen to our favourite music? In recent years, music-induced pleasure has been associated with increased functional connectivity and a richer neural network in the human brain as we know the brain reward system is activated at moments of peak emotional arousal.,In this context, our work builds upon recent research demonstrating that such findings can be understood by monitoring the brain’s electrical activity using electroencephalography (EEG) devices.,Our aim was to utilise wearable brain-scanning devices to record the underlying neural activity in nearly real-life settings, in order to study the effects of music on the listener’s brain dynamics.,The
#MyBrainTunes
experiment, that ran at the Science Museum from February – March 2020, used the latest technology to monitor human brainwaves while participants listened to music, to predict how much they liked a particular song.,It was an ambitious attempt to accommodate, for the first time, a wide-scale collection of human brainwaves during music listening.,Our goal now is to use the collected data to build computational models that will deepen our understanding of people’s music-listening brain states and investigate the roles that age, sex, ethnicity and music education has on which genres of music our brains enjoy.,So how did it work?,We began by selecting songs from the Official UK Singles Charts from the past 40 years. We then prepared an app for visitors to use to rate a sample of songs according to how much they enjoy them.,During the
Live Science
residency, we introduced the experiment to visitors. If they decided to participate, within a few minutes they were listening to and rating our selected songs. John Lennon or Adele? Queen or Coldplay?,One of the most enjoyable parts of the experiment was observing families, couples, friends and single visitors dancing along while they were marking their familiarity and likeness scores.,Then, with the help of our research team, everyone had their brainwaves recorded by wearable EEG headsets whilst they were listening to the same songs.,Afterwards, we shared graphs with the participants that illustrated their neural activity during different songs and showing how their brains responded to the songs that they liked versus the songs that they didn’t like.,We are currently exploring the data that we have collected, working on both engineering and scientific tasks.  With the help of modern brain signal analytics, our team is using the music-induced brainwaves to train algorithms for decoding the listener’s experience and disposition to particular musical pieces.,#MyBrainTunes
was funded by Imperial College London, and the results will be published later this year. You can

how they work here

There was a marked accelerator lag in the Rover, for instance — put your foot down and it wouldn’t start moving for a little while. Not ideal at the traffic lights. And it was very thirsty, so while it was a useful experiment, it was back to the internal combustion engine for cars.,Hidden amongst our older displays is this monster, by Metropolitan-Vickers, from the 1940s, in the Marine Engineering gallery.,It’s the first jet engine (gas turbine) ever used to power a ship – MGB 2009 (that’s

The first whole-body test dummy was developed in 1949 by the Sierra Engineering Company for the US Air Force. He was called ‘Sierra Sam’, and the firm went on to develop a series of figures: Sierra Stan (1967), Sophisticated Sam (1968, with General Motors) and finally Sierra Susie (1970). That’s our girl! By then, other companies were developing crash test dummies, with such glorious names as Dynamic Dan, Repeatable Pete and Tuff Kelly.,Here’s the reference: Advisory Group for Aerospace Research & Development, Advisory Report 330, ‘Anthropomorphic Dummies for Crash and Escape Systems Testing’, NATO, July 1996 (ISBN 92-836-1039-3).

Then 225 years ago, in 1784, the
Royal Mail coach system
was inaugurated. Fast coaches running to strict timetables operated a network of mail routes, each covering some eight or nine miles per hour by changing the horses at stages of about every ten miles.,The coaches were finely built and lightweight, but strong enough to withstand the shocks of the poorly-made British roads of the day.

We sailed from Ushuaia at the bottom of Argentina through an incredible storm with waves about ten meters high for two days. My first impression of seeing land having been thrown around on a boat, feeling like I was a weightless astronaut, was a sense of relief.,It was like something I’d never seen before, where there’s no sign of humanity at all and just literally hundreds of whales. Whale after whale and penguin after penguin and full of wildlife and these beautifully sculpted icebergs. It genuinely felt like we’d arrived on another planet.,SM: What surprised you the most about the icy continent?,JK: I think it was just the amount of wildlife. You look out from the side of the boat and there are killer whales, minke whales, humpback whales, sei whales – and then pods of penguins swimming as well. It was a constant stream of animals.,When we went to film with leopard seals, there were just thousands upon thousands of penguins. And what I loved as well is that they aren’t afraid of us at all. You go to so many places in the rest of the world and animals run away or they’re scarce, and actually in Antarctica, there are penguins sat right next to you. It means it’s great for the giant screen because you can get really nice and close and it makes it feel intimate, like you’re really there.,SM: Can you share some of your most memorable moments from the film shoot?,JK: We were working with some Argentinian scientists who were the most hospitable, friendly people. They fed us, played music, danced with us – we were all in our full Antarctic gear with boots and everything, and we would dance with them in the evenings, so that was a wonderful memory.,And of course, the memory of all the penguins when all the chicks had grown up and shed all their fluffy feathers and they all walk down to the sea for their first swim. They’re sat next to you waiting to go in and then some of them fall a sleep maybe a couple of meters away, so trusting. That’s a really sweet moment and it makes it all the harder when they then jump in the ice sea and they’ve got to somehow escape the jaws of a massive leopard seal.,SM: Were there any amazing moments of animal behaviour that you witnessed?,JK: One incredible animal moment where I suddenly thought, ‘OK, that’s in the film’: when a penguin manages to escape the jaws of a leopard seal and climbs onto an iceberg. The leopard climbs up onto the iceberg after it and is inching closer. The poor little penguin is just exhausted.,And this was happening right in front of us!,The leopard seal has its mouth open and the penguin is leaning forward and trying to peck this huge predator to get it away. Imagine a 30-centimetre-high penguin and a three-metre-long leopard seal – it’s completely David and Goliath! It was so brave and… well, I won’t spoil it, you’ll have to see the film.,SM: What was the biggest challenge of filming in Antarctica?,JK: It’s about the most mindful thing you can do to be sat on a coastline where no one else is and you’re watching penguins, waiting for some behaviour to happen. There is nothing challenging about it, it doesn’t matter that it’s cold or windy or that it’s snowy. I just found it really fascinating to sit from morning until evening, to watch and observe and then to capture it and turn it into engaging images for an interesting and inspiring story – that’s about as good as it gets.,SM: One of the main themes in the film is how what happens in Antarctica affects us all, even though the vast majority of us will never visit the continent. Can you explain a bit more about this?,JK: This is something that only came to light while we were making the film. We realised that actually Antarctica may be so far away and so remote but what happens there affects all of us, because all the life in the southern oceans and oceans themselves absorb, trap and lock away so much carbon – more than double that the Amazon rainforest does every year.,We’ve also got an amazing sequence in the film of hundreds of whales and you realise that these whales in the last 40 years since commercial whaling was largely banned in the 1980s have made a terrific come back, and the amount of carbon that they trap is so important. If these whales weren’t there, the oceans wouldn’t be healthy, carbon wouldn’t be trapped, and we’d all be much more impacted by climate change.,SM: What do you hope audiences will take out of the film?,JK: What I really love is the idea that audiences will come and enjoy the film. I want them to feel happy, inspired and awestruck but also hopeful and uplifted. I also want them to maybe take away that thought that actually what happens here in Antarctica is really critical for all of us and it’s worth fighting for.,Watch BBC Earth’s latest documentary

Instagram
feed is one of the channels that has been cheering me up.,Britain’s mapping agency is a household name, with their iconic maps accompanying many of us on our outdoor adventures.
Today, 21 June, is
a special anniversary for the organisation
, being the
date
now
recognised
as the birth of
the Ordnance Survey.,Strictly speaking, it’s hard to pin down an exact foundation date for the agency.
Its roots stretch back into the eighteenth century, though i
t wasn’t until 1801 that
the name ‘Ordnance Survey’
was first used when it was written onto a draft document
;
it first featured on a printed map in 1810.,But it was during summer 1791 that the ‘Trigonometrical Survey’ – the basis of the first accurate map of Britain – was initiated
.,On 21 June
1791
Charles Lennox, the Master-General of the Board of Ordnance, purchased an impressive
three-foot theodolite
. This instrument, now
on display in
Science City 1550-1800: The Linbury Gallery
,
became recognised as the founding act and was central to the survey’s activities for the next 70 years.,Theodolites measure horizontal – and sometimes, like this one, vertical – angles between points on a landscape.
They are used for a surveying practice known as triangulation
:
if you know the length of one side of a triangle, and its internal angles, you can calculate the other two lengths mathematically using trigonometry.,By creating a network of triangles across a landscape and measuring the angles, surveyors can calculate distances over the ground without having to measure them directly.,This theodolite was used to make the measurements that underpinned the first accurate maps of the nation, a project known as the Principal Triangulation of Great Britain. Precision was key, particularly as its users needed to account for the curvature of the Earth in their calculations.,The Ordnance Survey is so-called
because it was founded by the Board of Ordnance, the government department responsible for equipping the military. Though many of us perhaps now associate the agency and its maps with leisure, its name serves as a reminder of its origins: having an accurate representation of the nation’s topography was an issue of national security.,The all-important theodolite, however, almost ended up somewhere else entirely.,Jesse Ramsden
, one of Britain’s most esteemed makers of mathematical instruments, had been commissioned to construct the theodolite by the East India Company, who hoped to use it for their surveying work in India.,Ramsden, a notorious perfectionist, spent considerable time improving and adjusting the instrument
at his workshop in Piccadilly, London
, but when he presented the bill to the
company
they refused to pay
the high price he demanded
.,Fortunately for Ramsden, Lennox was
enthusiastic about the idea of initiating a trigonometrical survey of
Britain and
seized the opportunity to purchase the instrument for his department.,The theodolite
travelled the length and breadth of the country, its 200lb (90 kilogram) bulk transported in its own purpose-built carriage
between 1791 and 1858.,Moving to another object with an Ordnance Survey connection, t
his
scale
’s
case
bears the name of its
us
er,
Major-
General William Roy.
Even though
Roy
died in 1790 before the Principal Triangulation
was
underway
, he was an enormously important influence upon the fledgeling national survey.,Roy, a military engineer, had led the survey of the Scottish Highlands in the 1740s as the result of
a lifelong passion for cartography.,When
President of the Royal Society,
Joseph Banks
, sought a man to lead the British
team for a collaborative Anglo-French triangulation project in the 1780s, Roy was the obvious choice. This project, funded by the
Royal Society
and
King George III
, began in 1783.,Roy’s first task was to ascertain the accurate measurement of a baseline of which all other distances would be calculated. He chose a stretch of land just over 5 miles long on Hounslow Heath, in an area now mostly occupied by Heathrow Airport. This location was convenient for its proximity to London – which aided administration – and the fact that it was relatively smooth and level. That said, Roy’s team spent considerable time clearing the area of scrubby vegetation and molehills before they could begin their measurement.,A key piece of equipment was a
precise
ly-engineered
steel
measuring
chain.
This was constructed by Ramsden, and, true to the maker’s form, only arrived at the site after what Roy described as a ‘tedious delay’.,Once it had arrived, Roy
and his
team set about
painstakingly measuring the 5-mile baseline with the chain. After seeing it in action, Roy was impressed with its performance:,‘
… This most excellent chain seems not to have suffered any perceptible extension from the use that has hitherto been made of it. It is so accurately constructed, that when stretched out on the ground, as in common use, all the long plates lying vertically or edge-wise, if a person, laying hold of either end with both hands, gives it a flip or jerk, the motion is, in a few seconds, communicated to the other end, in a beautiful vertical serpentine line; when the person, holding that handle, receives a sudden shock, by the weight of the chain pulling him forcibly.

these excellent videos
made by Brady Haran and starring Professor Sir Martyn Poliakoff about the chemical elements.,Being on the lookout for additions to the museum’s
Women in Science tour
, I was amazed to learn how Marguerite Perey, then a humble assistant working for Marie Curie at the Radium Institute in Paris, discovered the element
francium
.,Perey’s role was to separate and purify radioactive elements, particularly actinium. Separating actinium was no easy task – naturally occurring uranium contains only a tiny proportion of actinium, about 0.2mg in one tonne (1,000,000 grams).,During her work Perey began to suspect that an anomaly in the radiation coming from actinium might be caused by a new element with a very short half-life (i.e. it decayed very rapidly).,She worked on the problem and on 7 January 1939 managed to establish that the anomaly was indeed caused by a new element with atomic number 87. She did this by quickly measuring the radioactivity of freshly purified actinium (atomic number 89), then again later. The initial activity was different, but soon became that normally seen from actinium.,Perey hypothesised that some of the actinium had, because of the emission of alpha particles, become an isotope (that is a version of a chemical element with a different number of neutrons in its nucleus) of element 87. The new element had a half-life measured in minutes and quickly decayed away.,Chemists knew that Mendeleev’s periodic table was missing the element at atomic number 87, which should be an alkali metal with chemical properties like caesium. Perey tested her hypothesis by precipitating caesium as the perchlorate in the presence of the new element.,Perey was right – the new element 87 co-precipitated with caesium, proving that it had very similar chemical properties. As the discoverer, Perey had the privilege of naming the new element. She called it francium, after her native France.,Discovering a new element was a major scientific achievement worthy of a doctorate at least, but because Marguerite was only a laboratory assistant with no university degree, she could not be awarded one. Even the paper describing her discovery had to be presented by someone else.,Fortunately, her excellence was recognised. She obtained a doctorate from the Sorbonne, became a professor at the University of Strasbourg and was the first woman to be elected to the Académie des Sciences of the Institut de France.,For all our talk of francium, it’s worth remembering there’s only a tiny amount of it on Earth. It’s estimated only a small number of grams exist in Earth’s crust at any one time. With such a short half-life, it is no surprise francium was the last naturally-occurring element to be discovered.,Discover more stories

, the wartime codebreaker who laid the mathematical foundations of the modern computer, has been granted a posthumous pardon by the Queen for his criminal conviction for homosexuality.,A Royal pardon is usually only granted where a person has been found innocent of an offence and a request has been made by a family member. This unusual move brings to a close a tragic chapter that began in February 1952 when Turing was arrested for having a sexual relationship with a man, then tried and convicted of “gross indecency”.,To avoid prison, Turing accepted treatment with the female sex hormone oestrogen: ‘chemical castration’ that was intended to neutralise his libido.,Details of the circumstances leading to his death on 7 June 1954, at home in Wilmslow, Cheshire, can never be known. But Turing had himself spoken of suicide and this was the conclusion of the coroner, following an inquest.,In 2009
Gordon Brown
, the then Prime Minister, issued a public apology for his treatment. A letter published a year ago in the
Daily Telegraph
, written by
Lord Grade of Yarmouth
and signed by two other Science Museum Trustees,
Lord Faulkner of Worcester
and
Dr Douglas Gurr
,
called on the Prime Minister to posthumously pardon Turing
.,Turing has now been granted a pardon under the
Royal Prerogative of Mercy
after a campaign supported by tens of thousands of people. An e-petition calling for a pardon received more than 37,000 signatures.,Chris Grayling, the Justice Secretary, said: “A pardon from the Queen is a fitting tribute to an exceptional man.”,The pardon states: “Now know ye that we, in consideration of circumstances humbly represented to us, are graciously pleased to grant our grace and mercy unto the said Alan Mathison Turing and grant him our free pardon posthumously in respect of the said convictions.”,But the reaction to the news has been mixed. Turing biographer
Dr Andrew Hodges
, of Wadham College, Oxford,
told the Guardian newspaper
: “Alan Turing suffered appalling treatment 60 years ago and there has been a very well intended and deeply felt campaign to remedy it in some way. Unfortunately, I cannot feel that such a ‘pardon’ embodies any good legal principle. If anything, it suggests that a sufficiently valuable individual should be above the law which applies to everyone else.,“It’s far more important that in the 30 years since I brought the story to public attention, LGBT rights movements have succeeded with a complete change in the law – for all. So, for me, this symbolic action adds nothing.,“A more substantial action would be the release of files on Turing’s secret work for GCHQ in the cold war. Loss of security clearance, state distrust and surveillance may have been crucial factors in the two years leading up to his death in 1954.”,The Science Museum’s award-winning
Turing exhibition
,which closed a few months ago, showed that a signature moment of Turing’s life came on February 13, 1930, with the death of his classmate and first love, Christopher Morcom, from tuberculosis.,As he struggled to make sense of his loss,
Turing began a lifelong quest
to understand the nature of the human mind and whether Christopher’s was part of his dead body or somehow lived on.,Earlier this year Turing’s Universal Machine, the theoretical basis for all modern computing,

Whilst she was there, she decided to pursue a career in astronomy. Opportunities for women in scientific academia were almost non-existent in England, so she decided to move to Harvard, USA.,In 1925, Payne completed her PhD at Harvard College Observatory for her work on the temperatures of stars and their chemical make up. During her research she discovered that the Sun was mostly made of hydrogen and helium.,However, this result conflicted with current understanding which stated that the Sun had a similar chemical make-up to the Earth. As such, she was persuaded to reject her findings by Henry Norris Russell, a leading astronomer of the day. He declared her results to be ‘clearly impossible’, although he admitted that her doctoral dissertation was the best he had ever read. In fact, it was so good that it was published as a book,
Stellar Atmospheres
!,In 1929, Payne was proved right by Russell himself who finally agreed with her results and cited her study – although he made no mention to his earlier disbelief.,In 1927 Payne became a fully-fledged Astronomer working at Harvard Observatory. She instructed graduate students and supervised doctoral research but was still denied an academic position, in spite of the fact that the Director of the Observatory, Harlow Shapley, believed she deserved one. This was due to the misogynistic views of the Harvard President, Abbott Lowell, who refused to appoint her and swore that she would never ascend to a Harvard professorship while he was still alive.,In 1938, under the leadership of a new President, Payne was finally recognised as an officer of Harvard, as the Philips Astronomer, although she was still denied the position of Professor even though she was more than qualified. Indeed, Shapley had needed to reassure Harvard that conferring the Philips Astronomer title on a woman would not make her a member of the college faculty.,Finally, in the late 1950s Cecilia Payne became a full professor and Chair of the Department of Astronomy – the first woman at Harvard to achieve this level of success and become a Head of Department. She celebrated by sending handwritten letters to all the female astronomy students and inviting them to a party in the Observatory Library. However, despite this success Payne was still paid less than her male equivalents across Harvard. A
gender pay gap
issue that still exists today.,In 1933, Payne and her future-husband Sergei Gaposchkin met each other for the first time in Germany. He had travelled 150 miles on a bicycle to greet her and ask her for her help. Gaposchkin was one of ten children born to poor parents in the Crimea. He had worked on fishing boats, farms and in factories to finally realise his dream of becoming an astronomer. However due to the political situation at the time and the rise of the Nazis he was under suspicion in Germany of being a Russian spy, and had been denied entry into Russia under suspicion of being a German spy. Payne solved this problematic situation by helping him get a visa to the USA and a position at the Harvard Observatory.,After working together at the Observatory, they fell in love and eloped to New York, where they were married. When the news was announced back in Harvard it was met with some shock as no one knew that a romance had been developing. Some people were particularly outraged by the match due to the fact that Cecilia was taller and earned more than her husband!  They went on to have three children together.,Cecilia Payne’s work was undeniably important to our understanding of the Sun and astronomy. However, due to her gender she had to work that much harder to fight for the recognition she deserved. Indeed, she described herself as
‘a rebel against the feminine role
’ and declared that her real rebellion ‘was against being thought, and treated, as inferior’.,Her career is a sobering reminder that the reason there were not more female scientists in history was not because of a lack of talent or passion, but instead due to the systematic misogyny of society. Women are still
under-represented in science
today for a variety of reasons but the future is looking sunny. And thanks to Payne we know that the Sun is made up of mostly hydrogen and helium!,This post was written alongside our blockbuster exhibition
The Sun: Living With Our Star

It is something I usually do rather unconsciously, as an automatic response to seeing food – as if the waiter had not placed it
exactly
as the chef wanted it to be.,This everyday action that some of us do might hint at the fact that we all enjoy our food more when it is ‘oriented’ in the best way possible.,Indeed, by arranging the food to ‘look better’, we might be unconsciously enhancing its perceived value, and hence our enjoyment of it.,But what exactly makes a given arrangement of the food on the plate feel more pleasing to look at, photograph, and possibly even eat?,A year ago, we stumbled upon this picture of one of the signature dishes of Alberto Landgraf, a Brasilian chef recently awarded one Michelin-star at his restaurant Epice, in Sao Paulo.,It caught our eye because its main ‘visual feel’ seemed to point away from the diner. Note how the individual v-shaped elements of the dish (pickled onions) had all been arranged so as to point upward, but also that the Gestalt (‘whole’) forms a triangle whose orientation points upwards.,With Andy Woods and Professor Spence, we created a new online test to assess the impact of different visual orientations of this image of food on people’s expectations.,Two hundred people took part in the first experiment, and the results suggested that if the food has an explicit point or angle, then people prefer the dish if the individual elements are oriented pointing ‘up’, or ‘away’.,The data also shows that people attribute a higher value, and are willing to pay significantly more, for the optimally oriented dish (the data was analysed using circular statistics, with the kind help of Professor Makus Neuhäuser).,We then replicated this experiment in collaboration with the
Science Museum
,
as part of a live science experiment in the
Cravings exhibition
(you can take part

). The image below shows the visual representation of the data gathered from the experiment between 20 February and April 2015.,The ideal angle to orient this particular plate of food is indicated by the arrow (3.20° clockwise), with the dots representing the orientation chosen by each of the 1667 participants.,We are already very excited about the insights we’re gaining from the
experiment
, in what is probably one of the largest experiments regarding the psychology of food ever conducted. As I write, 12,171 participants have taken part so far and that number is growing everyday.,In the
first published article
using data from the Science Museum experiment, our research suggests that visual shapes presented during a dining experience, and their orientation, could have an important role in modelling certain implicit psychological associations about the food, how we feel, perhaps even modelling the social interactions around the table.,In the end, every single food component on the plate, but also the non-edible elements on the table, could be affecting the pleasure elicited by food.,Certainly, anyone wanting to optimise the pleasure of food that they serve and eat might want to look further than just the design of the food, and think about how it is consumed and visually presented.,I believe much can be gained from developing a better understanding of the pleasure of food and exploring how aesthetically pleasing food compositions on a plate can really enhance our everyday food experiences.,Charles Michel is a chef and researcher on food aesthetics at Oxford University’s

To mark her birthday, Assistant Curator Rebecca Raven explores her life and work, including the invention of the sanitary belt, which played an important but overlooked role in the development of menstrual products.",Collections and Objects,"medicine,untold stories,women in STEM","Throughout history, black women have often been prevented from joining institutions committed to science, technology and engineering, but have nonetheless carried on in the face of prejudice and racism. Turned away because of the colour of her skin, Mary Kenner persevered and ended up filing five patents with the US Government, more than any other African American woman in history.,Mary Beatrice Davidson Kenner was born in 1912 in Monroe, North Carolina, and spent her life inventing contraptions to make everyday tasks easier for people.,Mary wasn’t the only inventor in her family. Her grandfather invented a tricolour light signal for trains, her father a clothing press that could fit in a suitcase, and her sister created boardgames. Inventing things was in her blood and she started at a very young age.,Around the age of 6, Mary noticed that the door in her family home squeaked when her mum left for work early, so she invented a device to stop the loud noise.,When the family moved to Washington DC when Mary was 12, she would often walk the halls of the United States Patent and Trademark Office to see if any of her ideas had already been invented; in most cases, they had not.,One of the most notable objects Kenner invented was the sanitary belt.,In the first half of the twentieth century, menstruation was an infrequently talked about taboo. In 1920s America, most people tended to make their own menstrual products at home out of cloths and rags like they had done
for centuries before
, and only really used commercial products, like Kotex pads, when they had to leave the house for school or work.,Of these commercially available products, Kotex pads were one of the first on the market. However, when asked by Lilian Gilbreth
in a review of the menstrual market
for Johnson & Johnson, they were described as ‘too large, too long, too thick and too stiff’ with participants prioritising comfort and protection over all else. Kenner’s menstrual belt set out to solve these complaints.,Kenner came up with the idea of a belt to hold a menstrual towel in the 1920s, but it was not until 1956 when she was able to raise enough money for the expensive patent process. Her invention held a pad in place in a ‘highly efficient manner’ as well as being ‘easy to use’.,The patent details how the belt included easily adjustable straps that allowed the user to wear the belt in the most comfortable position for them, eliminating negative effects like chaffing and irritation like most other products on the market.,Kenner was continually updating her inventions and three years later she filed another patent for a ‘sanitary belt with a moisture proof’ pocket, making it even more unlikely for blood to leak on to clothing.,The Sonn-Nap-Pack Company heard about Kenner’s patent and contacted her with the intention of making and selling her menstrual belt. Kenner remarks how excited she was, ‘I saw houses, cars and everything about to come my way’, but on meeting Kenner, the company declined her deal when they discovered she was black.,Other companies were reluctant to work with her based on the colour of her skin, and her patent expired, allowing manufacturers to profit off her idea with Kenner never making any money from the belt herself.,In the 1970s, disposable menstrual pads with adhesive strips became more popular, leading to the end of an era for the sanitary belt.,Racism prevented Kenner from profiting from her invention, but this did not stop her submitting a further three patents that each sought to solve everyday problems.,Two patents were related to solving problems around sanitation; a shower wall and bathtub mounted back washer that helped users reach difficult to access areas, and a bathroom tissue holder which caught the loose ends of toilet paper for easier use, especially for blind and partially sighted people and people with arthritis.,Her sister, and fellow inventor, Mildred lived with multiple sclerosis, so Mary invented an attachment for her walker that included a tray and pocket, allowing Mildred the dignity of moving herself and her belongings around without assistance. Kenner was constantly seeing problems and coming up with inventions to solve them for herself, her family, and wider society.,During her life, Mary Kenner filed a total of five patents to the US government, more than any other African American woman in history. She never became rich from her inventions or received any awards or formal recognition, like many black women whose extraordinary talents are so often overlooked.,Mary Kenner made life easier, more comfortable and dignified for people, and we have her to thank for developments in menstrual products that have led us to where we are today.,Mary Kenner’s biography on

With names like serine, leucine and alanine, nature strings together different combinations of these amino acids in proteins, whether those in hair, skin and muscle or the ones that break down food in the stomach.,Now researchers in Cambridge have found a way to create a synthetic bacterium to make proteins composed of novel amino acids, designed by scientists, that lie beyond the canonical 20 found in nature.,The synthetic bacterium was not only able to make novel kinds of protein, far more complicated than anything that can be made in the lab by chemists, but the genetic alteration rendered it virtually invincible to infection with viruses.,To carry out the feat, the team at the Medical Research Council (MRC) Laboratory of Molecular Biology led by Prof Jason Chin engineered the genetic code of a synthetic strain of the gut bacterium
E. coli
to include several nonstandard amino acids, akin to writing a book with several made-up letters in addition to the usual 26, from A to Z.,The advance rests on details of how huge molecular machines –
ribosomes
– that turn genetic code into protein within the bacterium read three “letters” of genetic code at a time, a “word” known as a codon, of which there are 64 different combinations.,There are only 20 amino acids because some are specified by more than one word: for example, the four different codons TCG, TCA, AGC and AGT all code for the same amino acid, serine.,In May 2019, Chin’s team
reported in the journal
Nature
that it had simplified the
E. coli
’s entire genetic code, or genome, so that it packs information more efficiently into the four million letters of DNA that provide the instructions for making a cell.,His team made an organism with a radically altered genome – the largest synthetic genome ever constructed from scratch – that used three fewer codons than the usual number. Though the modified bacteria – called Syn61 – no longer had the codons in their genome they could still make normal proteins and thrive.,Now, by further engineering of their bacteria, Chin’s team has been able to use the three codons removed from the genome to encode three “noncanonical amino acids” which are not found in nature; the result is synthetic
E. coli
with properties not found in biology.,The researchers were able to use the synthetic bacterium to create polymers made of up to eight chemical units – monomers – strung together and join the ends to make macrocycles – a type of molecule that forms the basis of some drugs, such as certain antibiotics and cancer drugs.,Prof Chin says his research could lead to the development of novel polymers – large molecules made of many repeating units, such as proteins, plastics, and many drugs, including antibiotics.,Synthetic bacteria ‘may be turned into renewable and programmable factories that produce a wide range of new polymer molecules with novel properties, which could have benefits for biotechnology and medicine, including making new drugs, such as new antibiotics,’ he says.,‘We’d like to use these bacteria to discover and build long synthetic polymers that fold up into structures and may form new classes of materials. For example, we will investigate applications of this technology to develop novel polymers, such as biodegradable plastics, which could contribute to a circular bioeconomy.’,In the study,
published yesterday in the journal
Science
, the Cambridge researchers also infected their synthetic bacteria with a cocktail of viruses. While natural bacteria were killed by the viruses the modified bacteria were resistant and survived.,The reason is that viruses reproduce by injecting their genetic instructions into a host cell, in this case a bacterium, and hijacking its cellular machinery.,However, when the machinery in the modified bacteria tries to read the virus genome, it fails every time it reaches the missing codons, halting the replication of the virus.,This ability to shrug off viruses is important because many drugs – for example, protein drugs, such as insulin, and polysaccharide and protein subunit vaccines, including
some being developed for COVID-19
– are manufactured by growing bacteria which contain instructions to produce the drug.,‘If a virus gets into the vats of bacteria used to manufacture certain drugs, then it can destroy the whole batch,’ says Prof Chin. ‘Our modified bacterial cells could overcome this problem by being completely resistant to viruses. Because viruses use the full genetic code, the modified bacteria won’t be able to read the viral genes.’,Although some may be uneasy about where this technology is heading, Prof Chin emphasised that, since humans harnessed fire, they have realised there is an upside and a downside to innovation – it is important experiments are done in a controlled way and properly discussed and debated with the public.,The first synthetic organism was created by the American biotech entrepreneur
Craig Venter
, whose microbial replicant based on a copy of the genetic code of the tiny bacterium
Mycoplasma
genitalium
was
unveiled in 2010
. The new work in Cambridge depends on a smaller team and is much easier to scale up, says Prof Chin.,Dr Megan Dowie, head of molecular and cellular medicine at the Medical Research Council, which funded the study to expand the lexicon of life, commented that it marks ‘a really exciting example of the value of a long-term commitment to fundamental, or discovery, science.’,Such research ‘has huge potential for major impact in biopharma and other industrial settings.’"
