They are present in novels, films, advertising, journalism and painting; in both the background and the foreground of representation. These images always amount to something more than the sum of their parts; they are never just about the forms of domestic space but speak of ideas that are deeper and more defining. The appearance of the open fire contained within the protective frame of the fireplace seems to speak to timeless values of comfort and repose, or to address an undefinable human need. In his Psychoanalysis of Fire (first published in 1938), the French philosopher Gaston Bachelard described the experience of reverie before an open fire as an essential human comfort that lies beyond historical determination (Bachelard, 1964). While such a claim appears to conform to common sense and shared experience, it also demonstrates the power of this particular mythology. Roland Barthes\u2019s work on mythology offers a useful framework for an understanding of the ways in which representations of the fireside have been circulated and consumed. For Barthes, the most important effect of myth is the transformation of history into nature; the way in which it suppresses historical conditions of existence in its production of meaning as timeless and inevitable. In this way, he describes myth as \u2018the foundation of a collective morality\u2019 (Barthes, 1972, p 59). To be sure, the fireside has a long and deep history, but its longevity is part of its mythic form. Whilst it bears the symbolism of ancient humanity it is also able to address very modern concerns indeed. This article examines the specific contemporary meanings of the post-war British fireside and of the coal fire in particular. Drawing on residual ideologies, it also expressed new, powerful meanings that specifically addressed the concerns of the post-war nation. Whilst these issues were defined in official discourses and fought over by commercial interests, it was in cultural life, and specifically through the visual forms of advertising and illustration that the myth of the post-war open fireside was most effectively popularised and disseminated. In the decade or so following the end of the war, domestic heating and, in particular, the look and feel of the open coal fire, was an active agent in debates concerning the reconstruction of the nation, the nature of British modernity and the future of the family. Housing was the first great problem for post-war Britain.[1] Its significance went far beyond the provision of dwellings, however. War had shattered families, physically, emotionally and psychologically and the home was necessarily the foundation of post-war social reconstruction and the restoration of family life; home would repair the damage of war. As the locus of economic and political power, the foundation of social reconstruction and the bedrock of emotional and psychic well-being, the home permeated all aspects of public and private life in the post-war period. It defined the aspirations of peacetime Britain and was the distinctive discourse of the period. Although housing was about material realities, it also existed through more abstract and intangible forms, in cultural expression and individual longing; it created the tones of post-war Britain. Whilst political parties struggled over the numbers of homes built, the home was not about statistics, it was about the qualitative life of the period and its deep expression, what Raymond Williams has called its \u2018structure of feeling\u2019 (Williams, 1958, 1961, 1977).In the years immediately following the war social workers and psychiatrists were agreed that British society was in a transitional stage and that the housing shortage was having a destructive effect on the lives of a generation. In a survey of two hundred soldiers and their wives, carried out between 1943 and 1946, Eliot Slater and Moya Woodside examined attitudes to marriage and concluded that the desire for a home was the most common reason for marriage and was of key importance to individual happiness. They found a huge disparity, however, between the fantasies of home and the material realities of post-war accommodation. Many couples were living with relations, or were renting rooms and flats in houses:\nWe found attics, top floors and basements; rooms over shops, pubs and off-licenses; bomb-damaged houses still unrepaired or partly repaired; unpainted cracking walls and ceilings; damp, draughts, and black-out arrangements permanently in position. The families who live in these homes had inadequate storage\u2026inadequate washing facilities\u2026 Many had no furniture of their own\u2026 Others had to make do with bare half-furnished rooms, decked out with the few pathetic bits and pieces they had been able to collect.\nThese were the forms of post-war domestic life; while exhibitions created furnished room sets and manuals set out the \u2018rules\u2019 for good interior design, many were living in surroundings that belonged more to wartime than to peace and that were more suited to life in a Victorian city than the planned towns of the post-war world. With little privacy and shared facilities, multi-occupancy houses were the reality for many who were \u2018setting up home\u2019, a situation that Slater and Woodside described as the \u2018\u2026tragedy of our era\u2019 (Slater and Woodside, 1951, pp 217, 125).Plans for housing that started out as radical visions of a new, modern society were frequently compromised by squeezed resources and political realities; the need for accommodation was so severe that large scale ambitions had to take a back seat to the basic provision of shelter for families. There remained a strong sense, however, that housing was not enough to restore society and did not necessarily create the homes and families that had been torn apart by the war and that were at the heart of social reconstruction. Whereas housing suggested a kind of anonymous mass, home was particular and individualised; it was the object of emotional and psychic investment and was associated with memory and with the past as much as with the modern and the new (Roberts, 1989, p 3).The object that seemed to embody the emotional affects of home and its restorative capacities was the open coal fire. In spite of its inconveniences, for many the mythology of the flames of the coal fire was a lived experience, representing all the accumulated meanings of home and family. Whilst bearing an almost primordial symbolism, they were a source of comfort that still claimed a place in modern, post-war society. Although these associations were present in earlier periods, they had been intensified during the war years, when the domestic hearth symbolised not only the individual family home but the home fires of the nation. In 1943 and in anticipation of a housing shortage when the war ended, Mass Observation published a survey of people\u2019s attitudes to home for the Advertising Service Guild (Enquiry, 1943).[2] Chapter sixteen was devoted to the subject of \u2018Warmth\u2019. Drawing on a random sample taken in May 1942, the survey stated that 78 per cent of people used coal for their living rooms, compared to only 15 per cent who used gas and three per cent who used oil. Moreover, asked \u2018what type of heating they would like if they could choose\u2019, 73 per cent said they would prefer an open coal fire. The reasons for this choice went beyond the provision of warmth, relating to what the report referred to as \u2018Coal Feelings\u2019. The coal fire was \u2018cheerful\u2019, \u2018homely\u2019, \u2018comforting\u2019 and looked nice; it had emotional and aesthetic qualities, \u2018intangible virtues\u2019 that were lacking in gas and electric fires (Enquiry, 1943, pp 136\u20137).One of the great advocates of the national coal fire was George Orwell. In his 1941 essay, \u2018England Your England\u2019, he evoked the embattled nation in terms of its essential and everyday values, \u2018\u2026the pub, the football match, the back garden, the fireside and the \u201cnice cup of tea\u201d\u2019 (http://orwell.ru/library/essays/lion/english/e_eye). These were images and ideas that symbolised an authentic working-class culture but which also superseded class and cohered a nation. Shortly after the end of the war Orwell went further. Saturday 8 December 1945 was a bitter winter\u2019s day. The forecast, published on the front page of the Evening Standard, was \u2018very cold: keen frost: local snow\u2019. In a column on the inside pages that day Orwell addressed the question of homes and heating in post-war Britain. As the nation moved from hurriedly constructed prefab houses to the provision of permanent homes, Orwell argued that every house or flat should have at least one open fire:\nFor a room that is to be lived in, only a coal fire will do\u2026 This evening, while I write, the same pattern is being reproduced in hundreds of thousands of British homes. To one side of the fireplace sits Dad, reading the evening paper. To the other side sits Mum, doing her knitting. On the hearthrug sit the children, playing snakes and ladders. Up against the fender, roasting himself, lies the dog. It is a comely pattern, a good background to one\u2019s memories, and the survival of the family as an institution may be more dependent on it than we realise (Orwell, 1945, p 6).\nHyperbole, perhaps, but Orwell draws on a powerful ideology connecting the traditional family home and the coal fire. Like mother and father, the fireplace should have a capital letter, for its place in constructing family life is equally pivotal. And Orwell suggested one further significance of the coal fire, it warmed the imagination as well as the body:\nThen there is the fascination, inexhaustible to a child, of the fire itself. A fire is never the same for two minutes together, you can look into the red heart of the coals and see caverns or faces or salamanders, according to your imagination\u2026 A gas or electric fire, or even an anthracite stove, is a dreary thing by comparison.\nThe open coal fire thus had \u2018an aesthetic appeal\u2019 and even the restricted heat it produced had a positive impact on family life, enforcing \u2018sociability\u2019 as parents and children huddled within the parabola of its warmth. It was an enduring myth. In 1957, in The Uses of Literacy, Richard Hoggart mourned the loss of authentic, working-class culture and community, symbolised by the family hearth: \u2018Warmth, to be \u201cas snug as a bug in a rug\u201d, is of the first importance\u2026a fire is shared and seen\u2019 (Hoggart, 1958, p 22). In spite of the accumulated symbolism of the coal fire there was growing acknowledgement in the post-war period that burning coal from domestic fireplaces was polluting the urban environment. Coal was difficult to store in bulk, it was awkward and dirty and with post-war shortages it was not necessarily a cheap option. Increasingly, the open fire was being used in combination with other forms of heating such as gas or electric fires. The coal fire might possess residual sentimental values, but it was not the fuel for a modern, clean, stream-lined post-war Britain. By the late-1940s a number of new council developments had been completed, which offered more space, better facilities and different forms of heating. In 1947 the Scottish writer Compton Mackenzie published The Vital Flame, a paean to gas, commissioned by the British Gas Council. Illustrated with 42 colour photographs, it celebrates the industrial, agricultural and domestic uses of gas power. Mackenzie describes a visit to a municipal block of flats, Kensal House in London, which provides \u2018smokeless homes\u2019 and is visited by architects and planners from all over the world (Mackenzie, 1947, p 34; see also plates 8, 28 and 32). Individual flats have gas cookers and water heaters and a \u2018gas-ignited coke fire\u2019 provides a cosy, but smokeless, fireside glow. Colour plates show the uniform, geometric lines of the exterior, as well as interiors such as a living room with slippers warming by the fireside (see Figure 1). The final plate is captioned: \u2018The Story Ends. Coal has yielded up its riches\u2019 and shows a woman cooking with gas and colour coordinated with her modern fitted kitchen, with a view of a gas power station through a window behind her (see Figure 2). The wealth that coal yields is gas.\nIn the years immediately following the war, it was evident that the open coal fire was incapable of providing these amenities and could not remain the fuel of modern housing. Bombing had continued the destruction of Britain\u2019s old housing stock and it was time to do away with Victorian living conditions. In January 1949 the illustrated weekly magazine Picture Post, which reported regularly on the progress of reconstruction and the condition of British cities in the decade following the end of the war, carried an article titled \u2018Housing: London Shows How\u2019, about the new housing developments in Stepney in the East End (see Figure 3). Comparing the old housing in the area to scenes from Oliver Twist, it assured its readers: \u2018The flats of 1949 are not the ugly tenements of Victorian days. They will be surrounded by playgrounds and railed-in gardens\u2019 (Townroe, 1949, p 33). It lists the facilities offered inside the accommodation including: a boiler in the kitchen; a sun balcony; and living-rooms with open fires (Townroe, 1949, p 8). This was the shape of the future, with flats and communities that would not only address the chronic housing problems of the nineteenth century, but would also create functional, modern living and, most importantly, homes that would restore and renew.\nThere is a fascinating oscillation in representations of home in these years between notions of the modern, the new, a fresh start and nostalgia and the persistence of the past, which is encapsulated in debates about the place of the coal fire in the modern home. Although the open hearth represented the heart and soul of the family home, a place of reverie and memory, it was also dirty and inefficient and was as responsible for the polluted air of Britain as smoke from industrial chimneys. One of the foremost domestic design questions, therefore, was how to resolve these competing objectives, how to provide the cosy atmosphere of the coal fire economically and without pollution. Engineering companies advertised adapted grates and boilers that would heat homes cleanly and efficiently, whilst retaining an open fire.[3] Here was a modern fire in a modern home; still using coal or coke but heating radiators and supplying hot water at the same time as providing a centrepiece for an uncluttered and comfortable living-room (see Figure 4; National Smoke Abatement Society, 1951, p 44). Ornaments on the mantelpiece, but not too many; coal in the fire \u2018that warms three other rooms\u2019.\nDomestic heating had become one of the key debates of social reconstruction. Smoke pollution and fuel consumption were the subjects of a series of campaigning articles that were published in Picture Post in the early 1950s. \u2018We are throwing away our birthright in a pall of smoke\u2019, it stated (Stobbs, January 1952, pp 30\u201331). Eighty per cent of coal used in 1951 was wasted; it was time to abandon the open fire and move to the closed stove: \u2018New types of stoves and fires that give improved warmth and efficiency but without sacrificing cheerfulness\u2019 (Stobbs, January 1952, p 15; see also Stobbs, March 1952, pp 15\u201317). To fuel reformers the arguments seemed clear cut; others, however, remained unconvinced. In January 1952 Picture Post quoted Mrs Charlton, the wife of an estate agent, who insisted: \u2018I like to see the fire. Even if it does cost us more to keep our old fire going, we\u2019ll still stick to it. It\u2019s more cheerful, more homely. This [closed stove] looks so cold\u2019 [original emphasis] (Stobbs, January 1952, p 14).\u00a0Following the Great Fog of December 1952, during which London was plunged into five days of thick smog and mortality rates soared, the arguments against domestic coal use became increasingly unassailable. There was a new urgency and public awareness to ongoing debates concerning air pollution and, following pressure from MPs, a Committee of Inquiry was set up under Sir Hugh Beaver, which published its final report in 1954 (see Nead, 2017, chapter one). Clean heating was a priority for modern homes and designers reworked the image of the open domestic fire so that it was compatible with the new furniture lines, the abstract forms and restrained patterns of post-war progressive living. \u2018Let\u2019s Keep the Home Fires Burning Without Wasting Heat and Fuel\u2019, demanded a Picture Post journalist in 1955. \u2018Keep the home fires burning\u2019; it was a phrase that evoked the spirit of the nation in wartime but this was a different post-war world. The new fires and stoves \u2018\u2026cut fuel bills, make rooms and houses warmer, and \u2013 horrors! \u2013 they look entirely different\u2019 [original emphasis] (Stobbs, 1955, pp 36, 37).\u00a0With the passing of the 1956 Clean Air Act and the introduction of smokeless zones, the race was on to sell new fuels and appliances to retailers and domestic consumers. Mr Therm, the cartoon mascot of the Gas Council since the 1930s, came into his own in the 1950s; the chirpy little gas-flame figure would put an end to fog, providing \u2018An open fire but no smoke\u2019 (see Figure 5).[4] An Orwellian fantasy of the family hearth, but updated and upgraded: a middle-class couple in an elegant, smokeless home.\nIt may seem too esoteric or whimsical to suggest that Mr Therm is a symbol of post-war Britain and yet he sits at the epicentre of a series of debates concerning reconstruction, the home and the family that began before the war and continued well into the second half of the twentieth century and that defined what it meant to be a nation that was both traditional and forward-looking. Since at least the beginning of the nineteenth century, when it was still possible to overlook the relationship of smoke and pollution, the hearth had been a symbol of comfort and prosperity. The coal fire was the heart of the family home and was the source of physical and spiritual sustenance; in the context of war it also stood for the defended nation.[5] These images retained a powerful hold on the post-war imagination and the desire for restorative peace; they were part of a fantasy of home, family and community that had survived the war but was still threatened by external and foreign forces. Whilst it was clearly a nostalgic and even reactionary outlook, it was nevertheless an effective ideology that defined experiences and expectations in the post-war years. In an article entitled \u2018No Place Like Home\u2019, published in 1957 in the self-confessed retrogressive and sentimental annual miscellany, The Saturday Book, Olive Cook celebrated \u2018\u2026the privacy, the well-curtained windows and the cosy fire of our own home\u2019 (Cook and Smith, 1957, p 15). In fact, this is a very 1950s take on the open fire. It is homely, private and self-contained; owner-occupied rather than a rented room with shared facilities. Whilst marriages and families were straining to adapt to post-war domestic life, the coal fire remained a symbol of continuity and well-being and in her second Christmas broadcast as Queen, it is hardly surprising that Elizabeth II drew on its reassuring and familiar image to represent the tribulations of the Commonwealth:\nWhen it is night and wind and rain beat upon the window, the family is most conscious of the warmth and peacefulness that surround the pleasant fireside, so our Commonwealth hearth becomes more precious than ever before by the contrast between its homely security and the storm which sometimes seems to be brewing outside\u2026 (Fleming, 1981, p 75)\nThese almost folkloric associations made it harder in the 1950s to legislate against domestic smoke than it was to regulate the smoke from industrial chimneys. Vested interests drew on the powerful rhetoric of the coal fire to combat the smoke pollution reports of the early-1950s and the growing inevitability of legislation. In its response to the 1954 Beaver Report on Air Pollution, a member of the Institute of [Coal] Fuel stated: \u2018I refuse to be deprived of some of the things that are dear to my heart, and one of them is the open fire\u2019; watching the flames of a coal fire, he continued, is a trigger for the romantic imagination, like \u2018\u2026watching waves break on the sea-shore \u2013 and who wanted to sit and look at the electric radiator or the gas fire?\u2019 (Journal of the Institute of Fuel, 1955, as cited in Thorsheim, 2006, p 180).[6] The National Union of Mineworkers was also a powerful lobby group in this period and it is possible that the Conservative Government\u2019s support of anti-smoke legislation was motivated, in part, by the desire to curtail the power of the miners. With royalty, industry, unions and popular culture mobilising the myth of the coal fire, it was up to Arnold Marsh, General Secretary of the National Smoke Abatement Society, to criticise the \u2018\u2026viscous sentimentality that surrounds the open coal fire\u2019 and to spell out the environmental problems created by this \u2018\u2026grand old English custom\u2019 (Marsh, 1947, p 216). The coal fire could only assume its symbolic image as a national custom and a repository of feeling through the people seated around it and in the 1950s those people were the happy companionable couple and their family. The coal fire was part of a post-war chain of being that started with the domestic hearth and progressed to the family, the home, the nation and the Commonwealth. According to the American sociologist and philosopher Lewis Mumford, the Paleotechnic world of iron and coal would be replaced by the Neotechnic world of light, colour and synthetics but post-war Britain existed in the interstices of both phases of development (Mumford, 1955). No one made use of these images and developed them more effectively than the advertisers. What better way to evoke the consuming comforts of home than through their contrast with the chilly chiaroscuro of the city? In the winter months, hot drink products such as Ovaltine and Horlicks, Bovril and Cadbury\u2019s Drinking Chocolate, ran advertising campaigns linking their brands with the restorative values of home. In December 1953, Ovaltine drew on the experience of the Great Fog with an atmospheric black and white image of a man hurrying home through a damp, dark street: \u2018Smog! As you come out into the damp, cold streets and the fog swirls into your eyes and nostrils, how heartily you wish you were at home by the fire with a hot drink in your hand!\u2019 (see Figure 6).[7] The imagined family he is rushing home to is as vivid as the choking damp air of the winter street but a few years later Ovaltine shifted its focus and depicted the world on the other side of the front door: \u2018Ovaltine Families Are Happy Families\u2019 (see Figure 7). Well-dressed, well-furnished and boisterously happy, this is the world of the domestic fireside, the safe haven from the storms brewing outside. There was, however, a more troubling possibility that the advertisers dared not hint at: perhaps the storms were not only outside the home but were also inside, creating conflict that not even Ovaltine could ease?\nWhen post-war Britain stared into the flames of their open coal fires they saw the past and the future; a world of childhood sentiment but also of shifting gender and class positions and a growing fissure between the pre-war and the post-war nation. At the same 1954 meeting of the Institute of [Coal] Fuel, where a man had reminisced about the pleasures of staring at a coal fire, the female mayor of Tottenham suggested that this was a highly gendered amusement, and that: \u2018In almost every home it was papa who wanted the comfort of an open fire when he returned from work, and it was mama who wished that electricity and gas were cheaper so that she could avoid some of the dirt caused by the open coal fire\u2019 (as cited in Thorsheim, 2006, p 180). One man\u2019s cosy fireside is another woman\u2019s labour. And there was one further element that was transforming familial sociality in these years. In its 1943 report on people\u2019s homes, Mass Observation made the prescient comment \u2018\u2026at present the fireplace often occupies a central position in the room\u2026and if houses are to be designed without fireplaces, some new focus may have to be found\u2019 (Enquiry, 1943, p 137). By the middle of the 1950s, television had consolidated its place at the heart of domestic entertainment: more people owned televisions; there were new ways of purchasing or renting sets; national network coverage had grown; and there were longer hours of broadcasting. Steadily and inexorably, the television set usurped the open coal fire at the heart of family life. It could not provide warmth but it could feed the fantasy of the cosy hearth; it comes as no surprise that the virtual fireplace, with crackling flames and glowing logs and coals, is a favourite video today for smart televisions and computer screensavers. No dirt, no smoke, same dream."},

A thing, catalogued as part of a \u2018miscellaneous collection\u2019, with the note attached: \u2018\u00bd vol. not relevant.\u2019 Formally, the object is one part of a collection of books on aeronautica, among the hundreds of items bequeathed by Miss Winifred Penn-Gaskell to the Science Museum on her death in 1949. More descriptively, it is a red, leather-bound album with rough, browning paper and the word \u2018SCRAPS\u2019 embossed in gold lettering on its spine. Inside is a selection of cuttings, classified into three types: early-twentieth century aircraft (see Figure 1); contemporary car models (see Figure 2); and pictures of nude and semi-nude male athletes (see Figure 3). It is a wonderful thing to uncover in the stores at Blythe House, especially as little is known of its former owner besides her spinster status, the address of her isolated cottage and her enthusiasm for aerophilately.\nThe Penn-Gaskell scrapbook is a rare moment of amateurism in the otherwise expertly curated collection of its owner. Scrapbooks themselves, as Ellen Gruber-Garvey has recently demonstrated, transcend the boundaries between mass print culture and personal taste in a way that makes each version a generically representative and yet unique object (Gruber-Garvey, 2012). Historians of such ephemera are tasked, simultaneously, with reading coherent contextual information from a (usually) non-textual object, and trying to resist biased confirmations of pre-conceived theses. In my study of the scrapbook I encountered my own bias in a desire to reanimate the figure of Winifred Penn-Gaskell, a woman representative of a number of maligned and intriguing figures in the history of folk art, museology, and aviation history. \nSeeing the scrapbook for the first time brought on a moment of shock, as the juxtaposition between the anonymous and impersonal transport clippings with sexually-charged portraits of male bodybuilders fell out of the volume's pages. It seemed, initially, to confirm my suspicion that there was a depth of imagination, creativity and desire to the woman I had previously encountered only through her dry personal correspondence with the Science Museum, and her collection of balloon-themed snuffboxes. It was the first 'problem' I had encountered in the archival work I had been engaged in on the Penn-Gaskell collection, and the challenge it posed was one of defining the collection. Aeroplanes held an obvious space in the history of the Penn-Gaskell collection within the Science Museum, and an interest in early-twentieth century automobiles seemed fairly contiguous with this, but where did the nude male athletes fit in? Understanding the scrapbook\u2019s presence within the collections at the Science Museum is one thing, but how to grasp its significance for Penn-Gaskell herself? Moreover, what might this ephemeral object explain about the history of collecting, and the story of early-twentieth century transport technology in relation to the male body, that other, more significant objects already on gallery display in the Science Museum could not?\nIn the first issue of the Science Museum Group Journal (March 2014), Ben Russell outlined the successful integration of James Watt\u2019s workshop into the Science Museum Energy Hall. Despite the apparent incongruity, Watt\u2019s room of workbenches and the materials for his sculpture machine sit alongside the rotative steam engine in the museological narrative of British industrial history. The link between the everyday environment of an inventor and the results of his life\u2019s work is invoked through the visitor\u2019s assumed interest in the practices of this great man. Watt\u2019s workshop, in this sense, is the historic antecedent of a thousand garden sheds, in which diligent tinkering enables eureka moments, changing the technological course of the world. In this paper, I hope to suggest that narratives of failure, of public disinterest and material irrelevancy can offer just as much to the historian of technology who investigates the curatorial practices of science museums as successful histories of men such as Watt. Failure, as Jack Halberstam points out, (Halberstam, 2011) is a behaviour and style adopted by those who cannot compete within the common market, those whose realities are seen as oppositional to and critical of a popular social narrative of success. This article will look at the Penn-Gaskell scrapbook, a single object that has been deemed a failure in its role within a wider collection, and ask what kind of knowledge can be gained from it. The questions driving this investigation are concerned with the broader treatment of insignificant objects within museums that demonstrate national, or global scientific progress, as well as the specific historic context in which the Penn-Gaskell scrapbook was made. What are the processes by which we attempt to \u2018read\u2019 an illegible object, about which little is known or cared?\nWhere Russell concludes that the placement of Watt\u2019s workshop in the Science Museum should lead the visiting public to re-engage with a culture of making, doing and selling, I want to suggest that categories of maker, seller and buyer are not entirely clear-cut in the context of the Science Museum and its collections. Private collections donated to the Museum illustrate this generally, since distinctions between activities of making, selling and buying are compressed into linear histories of acquisition. The scrapbook of Penn-Gaskell is a case-in-point; the non-textual book, filled with photographs of different genres of models \u2013 from bloated airships to slender boxers \u2013 presents a series of problems to the historian of technology, and to those who study the collections of the Science Museum. In this study it will be necessary to resist interpretative limits which tell us there is one place for photographs of naked male bodies and a separate place for clippings of Bl\u00e9riot monoplanes. This argument for categorical fluidity will be applied to our investigation of the scrapbook itself, as well as to its history within and without of the Science Museum. It is in this way that I hope to show the museological value of the economically useless object."},

The new routines required new instrumentation that more effectively accommodated the production of astronomical observations in large numbers and the specialised division of labour. In light of this, from 1845 onward, Airy began the re-instrumentation of the ROG. During the next fifteen years, five new major instruments were installed at the buildings: the Altazimuth, the Reflex Zenith Tube, the Airy Transit Circle, the Barrel Chronograph, and the Great Equatorial (Satterthwaite, 2001, pp 101\u2013113). However, not all of them were used with the same regularity and success. For example, the Great Equatorial did not form part of the routine work of the Observatory, and the Reflex Zenith Tube was considered a faulty instrument. By contrast, the Altazimuth and the Transit Circle were used on a daily basis, and solidified the focus of the ROG on the field of positional astronomy for the last thirty years of Airy\u2019s directorship.\n\u00a0The Transit Circle has remained in its original position ever since its installation in 1850.[2] However, when the ROG was transformed into a museum, the possibility of transferring all of the instruments from the Observatory to the Science Museum was repeatedly discussed. Ultimately, the director of the neighbouring National Maritime Museum \u2013 Frank Carr \u2013 made a successful case for gaining control over the fate of the ROG (Littlewood and Butler, 1998, pp 179\u2013180). Carr achieved this by emphasising that the ROG was set up with the historical aim of finding ever more precise ways of determining longitude at sea. Through the \u2018quest for longitude\u2019, and through the Observatory still being funded by the Admiralty in the 1950s (until 1965), Carr was able to place the historical functions of the ROG within maritime history, thereby making the basis for connecting it to the National Maritime Museum.[3] The discussion about the fate of the instruments in the 1950s was not the first time the Science Museum and the ROG came into contact over these instruments. As the article demonstrates, the South Kensington Museum (which became the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1899, and from which the Science Museum was formed in 1909) had on display a model of the Transit Circle for over seventy years (from 1857 to 1928). The aim of this article is to reconstruct the history of the model of the Transit Circle from the workshop of the ROG, through the 1855 Exposition Universelle in Paris, to its eventual inclusion in the Educational Collection of the South Kensington Museum.\nThanks to George Airy\u2019s meticulous insistence on preserving the documents related to the ROG, a wide-ranging correspondence survived about the first years of the model.[4] The documents give us an almost complete view of the network that contributed to its production, which included instrument makers, government officials, carpenters, banks, astronomers and commercial firms. To understand the interaction of the different entities with the model of the Transit Circle, the article\u2019s approach is influenced by the theoretical frameworks of Actor-Network Theory and Object biographies.[5] Actor-Network Theory considers the analysis of both humans and non-human entities (collectively labelled actants) to be equally significant. Such an approach allows the research to follow non-human actants as they interact (or associate) with different networks. In the case of this article, following the model of the Transit Circle as an actant highlights the network that was set up to support the 1855 Exposition Universelle and demonstrates how different actants interacted with the model. Within Actor-Network Theory, the interpretations and meanings associated with material objects always emerge from the network within which they are embedded, as opposed to from an inherent design and essence found within their material reality. Such an approach brings forth the various meanings and associations attached to actants by the networks that they pass through. This movement of actants through networks is called the chain of translation. According to Bruno Latour, a good application of Actor-Network Theory is one that describes the movement of actants through various networks, and shows how every network alters the actants through creating different associations with them (Latour, 2005, p 129). This article highlights how different networks translated the Transit Circle\u2019s model and how such translations shaped its materiality. In addition, the article demonstrates the various meanings attached to the model of the Transit Circle, such as an \u2018instructive model\u2019, an example to Airy\u2019s re-instrumentation programme, a financial burden or a reputable astronomical instrument. This nano level approach reflects Actor-Network Theory\u2019s preoccupation with defining the social as the translation processes. However, due to the overwhelming number of entities that it can incorporate into its analysis, it is difficult to define the limits of the network that still affects an entity. This can result in overestimating the influence of actants at the boundaries of networks, while at the same time underplaying the role of actants in positions of power (Feenberg, 2017, pp 643\u2013644). The boundaries of the networks described in this article are set by the historical documents preserved among the Airy papers. By doing so, it emphasises the central role that Airy played in managing the fate of the model, and how he negotiated the embodiment of the different meanings in the final form of the model.\nObject biographies offer another theoretical framework for examining the history of the model. This process is useful for the historical analysis of material objects as primary sources. The approach has been used in various fields with a focus on the materiality of objects, including archaeology, anthropology (Kopytoff, 1986; Gosden and Marshall, 1999) and museum studies (Hill, 2012). Similarly to Actor-Network Theory, it is characterised by an agreement about objects forming part of social networks. However, while early works in object biographies consider them to embody and reflect social relations (Kopytoff, 1986), later studies perceived objects as entities that actively participated in the co-production and maintenance of social relations (Gosden and Marshall, 1999). Within history of science, a similar theoretical division can be identified. At its very extremes, the approach allows historians of science to interview and talk to objects through the language of their materiality (Daston, 2004). However, it is most often used to highlight the ways in which the meanings of objects are altered in different social contexts and to follow the life of an object from its construction to its eventual destruction (Alberti, 2005). Within such an approach, alterations made to the materiality of an object become just as important as an individual making a new decision. They highlight new intentions being embedded within and mediated through the object. Therefore, object biographies demonstrate how the chain of translations in the meanings of an entity (as emphasised by Actor-Network Theory), are implemented into its material configurations. Similarly, examining the construction process highlights alternative ideas that were considered to be implemented into an object\u2019s materiality, and reveals what intentions the final form of an object mediates to individuals who interact with it. In the case of the model of the Transit Circle, this article shows that Airy attempted to mediate an educational and instructive aim, which was repeatedly countered by different groups involved in the making of the model. In brief, combining elements from the two approaches makes it possible to analyse the competing and the superseding narratives that were ascribed to the model by different networks.[6]\nThis article tells the story of the model of the Transit Circle by starting out with a description of the status of the ROG around 1855, and how the Transit Circle fitted into the work of the institution. The article then shifts its attention to the 1855 Exposition Universelle in Paris, and how the British authorities decided upon exhibiting a model of the instrument there. A longer elaboration then follows, on the obstacles that both Airy and the British organisers faced during the construction and the installation of the instrument. The article then analyses the reception of the exhibited model, and its eventual return to London. Finally, the piece reflects upon how the model used to be exhibited in the South Kensington Museum, and how it was deaccessioned in 1928. By following the story of the model, the article shows the chain of translation from a model demonstrating the re-instrumentation programme through various other associations until its final form as an instructive exhibit at the South Kensington Museum. This way the article shows that the coexistence of multiple associations and the inability to ascribe a single dominant meaning into the materiality of the model led to major problems with understanding its purpose, which resulted in its destruction.\nThe case study also adds to the existing scholarship on Airy by demonstrating how the model illustrated the cooperation between \u2018science as well as Industrial Art\u2019, thereby becoming a symbol for Airy\u2019s transformation of the ROG into a \u2018factory\u2019.[7] Through an analysis of Airy\u2019s communications with the members of the networks involved in the production of the model, the article shows how he controlled the representation and display of the instrument to both general and specialist audiences. This way, Airy\u2019s control is not limited to the internal business of the Observatory. Instead, it encompasses the management of the public image of the ROG (and its instruments). By doing so, this article also shows how the Transit Circle had already enjoyed an international reputation before being recommended as the instrument to define the Prime Meridian at the 1884 International Meridian Conference. Such a consideration opens up the necessity for the scholarship to consider the contribution of the instrument to astronomy and navigation between 1850 and 1884, in order to demonstrate how it achieved the reputation of a reliable instrument. Finally, the article highlights how even nineteenth-century astronomers using the instrument on a daily basis struggled to communicate it to a general audience. Therefore, the problem of displaying the Transit Circle to visitors today is taken away from the problem of being an \u2018outdated\u2019 instrument, into a new framing where its display already presupposes prior knowledge about the uses of the instrument."},

Pepys was a Member of Parliament and administrator of the Navy, and is perhaps most famous for keeping a diary for almost a decade during his younger life. A few weeks earlier, despite \u2018very cold weather\u2019 he had celebrated a phase of good health, unsure whether to attribute it to his daily pill of turpentine, the fact that he had \u2018left off the wearing of a gowne\u2019, or simply his \u2018hare\u2019s foote\u2019. Yet this good health did not last. The new year brought burning, pimples and pricks, bladder problems, headaches and \u2018a great deal of pain\u2019 to Pepys\u2019 body (Pepys; Wheatley (ed), 1893).[1] On this January morning, however, he had run into an acquaintance at Westminster Hall \u2013 Sir William Batten, Member of Parliament and surveyor to the Navy (Pepys, Latham (ed), 2003, p xlv).[2] Batten had given Pepys medical advice regarding his latest ailment, a most painful bout of colic, for which he showed Pepys the mistake he had made with the hare\u2019s foot and guaranteed the perfect modification to his remedy. Originally, the foot had not been cut properly, and \u2018hath not the joynt to it\u2019; this was where the problem lay.[3] Eager to try anything to alleviate his swollen belly and \u2018grudgings of wind\u2019, Pepys handled Batten\u2019s correctly cut hare\u2019s foot, and noted in wonder:\n[Batten] assures me he never had his cholique since he carried it about him: and it is a strange thing how fancy works, for I no sooner almost handled his foote but my belly began to be loose and to break wind, and whereas I was in some pain yesterday and t\u2019other day and in fear of more to-day, I became very well, and so continue.[4]\nThe next day, having obtained a new animal and taken Batten\u2019s advice, Pepys was finally convinced: \u2018To my office till past 12, and then home to supper and to bed, being now mighty well, and truly I cannot but impute it to my fresh hare\u2019s foote.\u2019[5] One thing was clear; the hare\u2019s foot had worked. Pepys was cured of colic.\nThis object is not unfamiliar to us. This particular hare\u2019s foot, which forms part of the Science Museum\u2019s amulet collection, is originally from Norfolk and dated 1870\u20131920, but hares\u2019 and rabbits\u2019 feet can still be bought as \u2018lucky charms\u2019 and are widely available on the internet.[6]\u00a0 Populist literature similarly continues to reference the use of these items; Scientific American published an article on \u2018What Makes a Rabbit\u2019s Foot Lucky\u2019 in 2011 (D\u2019Costa, 2011). Such objects remain a part of popular culture \u2013 that is, part of recognised cultural traditions \u2013 over three hundred years after being employed by Pepys. Yet we can observe a shift in function. In Pepys\u2019 world, the various elements that constituted sickness and health were broad and wide-ranging. Illness, like health, could be affected by an extensive range of things from an imbalance of the bodily humours, environmental factors such as sleep, food, emotions and exercise, supernatural or preternatural forces, and even the stars.[7] Whilst Pepys sometimes consulted learned medical practitioners, the variety of people from whom he could seek counsel was extensive. In this case, he took the advice of his friend Sir William Batten.[8] Pepys\u2019 story is part of a larger narrative of healing in which learned medicine, religion, astrology, magic, fate and fortune all played a role. As part of healing, objects could be invested with power from any one or more of these various sources, and employed to cure or protect. These objects have often been called amulets, both historically and today, although our interpretation of them has changed over time. The healing potency of amulets has not always been entirely understood, and their means of operation often hidden from comprehension. Yet within their own contexts, this functional complexity has not detracted from the items\u2019 curative or protective effects. The narrative of healing that included amulets continued throughout the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and only when modern medicine necessitated \u2018scientific\u2019, empiric evidence of the mechanisms of objects\u2019 efficacy did this change. In other words, amulets were relegated from the domain of authorised healing once it became a requirement to know and explain how cures worked, not just that they did work.\nThe word \u2018amulet\u2019 originates from the Latin \u2018amul\u0113tum\u2019, and was used by Pliny the Elder (23\u201379 CE) to denote an item worn on the body for therapeutic, apotropaic or exorcistic benefit (Skemer, 2006, pp 6\u20137). Whilst many have noted the belief that the word can be traced back to Arabic, the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) has refuted this (OED, 2018, \u2018amulet\u2019). Whilst definitions vary, \u2018charm\u2019 is often used synonymously with \u2018amulet\u2019, whilst \u2018talisman\u2019 features less frequently. For instance, the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford has implied a semantic similarity between \u2018amulets\u2019 and \u2018charms\u2019, noting that an amulet is defined by the OED as: \u2018Anything worn about the person as a charm preventative against evil, mischief, disease, witchcraft, etc.\u2019, whilst a charm is described as \u2018Anything worn about the person to avert evil or ensure prosperity\u2019 \u2013 \u2018though a charm may also be a spell or incantation believed to have a magical power\u2019 (Pitt Rivers Museum, 2017). \u2018Amulets\u2019 and \u2018charms\u2019 are also used synonymously by the Horniman Museum in London, and the Oxford English Dictionary\u2019s definitions further allude to this; one entry noting that a charm is \u2018Anything worn about the person to avert evil or ensure prosperity; an amulet\u2019 (Horniman Museum, 2017).[9]Evidently, amulets cannot be easily and simply defined, in part because the ways in which they have been used and understood have changed from antiquity to today. What, then, is the defining feature which makes an object an amulet? The answer to this is, its power. In the most basic and fundamental way, amulets are invested with the potency to heal. Healing centres around cure and protection, but where once these two actions were closely related, now they are more distinct. Historically, healing has not been monolithic and has taken many forms, relating to and deriving from faculties of fortune, fate, astrology, religion, magic, luck and more. Healing could therefore constitute anything from curing a specific disease, to averting a malevolent force, or fostering good fortune. This functional variation is valuable, as it can tell us a great deal about the practices and cultures in which objects are situated, as well as the objects themselves. For instance, around 250 years after Pepys cured his colic with our first amulet, the hare\u2019s foot, an amusement park opened in Paris. As part of their brand Luna Park adopted a mascot known as a \u2018Billiken\u2019, a creature devised by an American artist who reportedly saw the mysterious figure in a dream and patented it in 1908. The Billiken, known as \u2018God of Things as They Ought To Be\u2019 was said to bring the customer luck, indicated by the inscription upon our second object, the park\u2019s token: Si tu me gardes je te porterai bonheur (\u2018If you keep me I will bring you good luck/happiness\u2019) / \u2018I smile at you bad luck can\u2019t harm you\u2019.[10] This amulet offered protection and generated auspicious effects to the person who possessed it. Evidently, it had been considered important enough to be kept. Thus whilst culturally, temporally and materially distinct, the hare\u2019s foot and the Luna Park Billiken are nevertheless united by their curative and protective potency, and demonstrate the wide spectrum of healing.\nYet where once healing and amulets went hand in hand, modern discussions tend to treat them as distinct. Labelling certain objects as \u2018amulets\u2019 questions their power to work, and when these items and their potency are challenged, they are \u2018othered\u2019, relegated and disassociated from the realms of healing. The hare\u2019s foot provides an example of this. Whether situated in museum collections or referred to in common parlance, this amulet is not commonly recognised today as a curative object, nor regarded as an effective remedy for the colic. Instead, the feet of rabbits and hares are now bought, used and regarded often merely as \u2018lucky\u2019 items. This hare\u2019s foot from the Science Museum\u2019s collections is recorded as an amulet employed \u2018for protection against cramp\u2019.[11] To label something as prophylactic, an item \u2018against\u2019 a particular affliction exemplifies typical language employed within museum catalogues in relation to amulets. Often, protective rather than curative functions of these objects are highlighted, perhaps because of the changing place of amulets in the narrative of European healing (for instance, Rowlands, 2001). If we therefore take this into consideration, the classification of the Science Museum\u2019s hare\u2019s foot and Pepys\u2019 hare\u2019s foot are similar, colic and cramp sharing many characteristics. We do not yet have a full history of the hare\u2019s foot. It may be that this object has been affected by historical changes and cultural discontinues hidden by the passage of time. Yet whether vague semantics or functional progression, the hare\u2019s foot also epitomises the modern tendency to assume we know what an object is for, as many museums catalogue hares\u2019 and rabbits\u2019 feet as \u2018lucky\u2019 regardless of the era from which they originated, and without acknowledging any evolution of use.[12] Historians, too, often erroneously refer to Pepys\u2019 practice of carrying his \u2018lucky hare\u2019s foot\u2019.[13] Through this tendency to infer an item\u2019s purpose, assumptions are made about the power and value of objects; a trend applicable to many objects that are similarly regarded today as \u2018amulets\u2019.[14]In short, when removed from their original contexts, amulets do not fit within modern, Western, rigidly defined notions of healing. As such, they often have their mysterious apotropaic values highlighted and sensationalised, whilst their fundamental healing power can be denigrated and trivialised. One common manifestation of this is the connection of amulets and their practices with superstition. Indeed, there seems to be a tendency to group anything vaguely esoteric, supernatural or unexplainable into the category of \u2018amulets\u2019.[15] This is in some sense prudent, as doing so provides scope for a great level of subjectivity afforded to these objects. However, to class amulets in general in this way disregards their disparate and diverse provenances and functions, undermining the fact that they were legitimate items within their own contexts, and leading to pejorative connotations being formed.[16]The reasons for this anachronistic categorisation could be multifarious. As discussed, objects such as hares\u2019 feet do not align within the modern Western boundaries of healing, and the fact that objects\u2019 value and power evolves and changes over time is often forgotten. In part, sensationalising \u2018things\u2019 is attractive; the idea of looking back on the objects and practices of a mystical past is captivating. Maybe scant information about distinct items or groups of objects and their contexts means that a term like \u2018amulet\u2019 simply becomes a useful catch-all category when specific functions, provenances or meanings cannot be inferred. Moreover, whilst amulets are necessarily defined by collectors and museum curators, often the descriptions they give are promulgated uncritically. Both within the Science Museum and within similar institutions that hold a substantial collection of amulets such as the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford, the debt owed to twentieth-century collectors cannot be overstated. Men including Henry Wellcome (1853\u20131936) and Edward Lovett (1852\u20131933), who both harboured a passion for collecting alongside other occupations, amassed objects from across geographies and temporalities which went on to form part of the Wellcome Trust\u2019s and Science Museum\u2019s collections[17] (Cadbury, 2012). However, the sheer volume of their stock often led to vague and questionable cataloguing, and it appears that dates given to Science Museum amulets often relate not to the object themselves, but rather to the dates of the collector (usually around 1870\u20131930).[18] Ultimately it is likely that these are self-perpetuating actions, in that once the purpose of an object has been misinterpreted or disassociated from the realms of healing, this then continues amongst other institutions and individuals until it becomes the default, primary function of the item in question.All of these possible reasons affect the way that amulets are thought of and defined today by academics, museums and members of the public. How far are such approaches necessary to allow audiences such as museum visitors to more easily engage with and relate to such seemingly unfamiliar objects? And how far is this approach intrinsically condescending, by patronising these things, their users, and the world from which they originated? Museums want visitors to be able to respond to their material, but in doing so they may sacrifice some of the \u2018truths\u2019 of some of the objects\u2019 lives (see Kopytoff, 1986). Research on these items is rich and wide-ranging. Their analyses range from their situation within a particular culture, region or time-period, to more broad ranging studies of amulets within the disciplines of archaeology or anthropology.[19] Other articles examine specific amulets, whether as an object-study or as a means of elucidating a facet of ritual or practice.[20] Fewer historicise them, or consider their changing definitions or functions over time or space.[21] Yet this facet of study is crucial for museums that deal with a large, disparate group of objects all labelled as \u2018amulets\u2019. They are complex, ambiguous and subjective objects that have differed and continue to differ according to social, spatial and temporal geographies. As such, their functions, materials and cultural significances vary enormously. However, this interpretative challenge is concurrently what makes amulets so rewarding and worthy of study, as their examination can reveal facets of a particular culture or time\u2019s methods of healing that cannot be afforded by reference to textual sources alone. Just as the boundaries of what comprises an amulet are open enough to allow for a wide definition of healing, museums and academics should accept and recognise amulets and their contextual evolution as part of the history of healing. It is important, as far as possible, not to \u2018other\u2019 amulets \u2013 not think of them as bizarre, folkish pieces of the past, and instead recognise that they form parts of the broad and varied history of healing. The Science Museum is helping to lead the way. During my time as a Wellcome Trust Secondment Fellow, I was afforded the opportunity to work closely with this museum\u2019s amulet collection, building upon my doctoral research on magic and the material culture of healing in early modern England. The Science Museum has over two thousand amulets, many of which were donated by collectors like Lovett and Wellcome, providing an invaluable source base. My interest in this group of objects arose after I had noticed that many of the seventeenth-century medical objects I was studying were categorised as amulets and also disassociated from healing, whether by scholars, museums, archaeological organisations or populist literature. While institutions such as the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford house an equally significant collection of amulets (see their \u2018Small Blessings\u2019 project), the Science Museum is one of the only organisations which actively and explicitly recognises the important relationship between amulets and healing. In fact, amulets are being spotlighted in the new Medicine galleries opening in 2019, as an integral part of the institution\u2019s motives to situate these objects within \u2018scientific\u2019 milieu. Amulets from across cultures and times are shown as real, potent facets of healing \u2013 even if not what we expect. They are challenging our (perhaps pre-formed) assumptions, and making us think. In the same way, this study explores how this complex, heterogeneous group of objects can help us understand the curative and protective worth and potency amulets had and continue to have. This article aims not to give a comprehensive history of amulets, but to present one of many possible histories in order to show how amulets form an important part of healing. The hare\u2019s foot, the Billiken, and the eight remaining objects that form the focus of this paper are classed as amulets within the collections of the Science Museum, and were chosen for their material, functional and contextual variability. All were created and used from around the sixteenth to the twentieth centuries, a more limited temporal trajectory allowing for a closer study. Due to the remits of this article and the fact that many non-Western objects have different histories and contexts, European items form the focus of the examination. In what follows, I will demonstrate what these ten amulets can show us about changes and continuities in European healing from the early modern period until the present day."},

Though its owner is unknown, its small size \u2013 the folios measure approximately 12.1 x 9.1 cm \u2013 suggests that it was designed for the personal prayer and contemplation of an individual. Taylor 17 contains a variety of Middle English prayers including a verse prayer on the five wounds of Christ known as \u2018Gracious Lord for Thy bitter passion\u2019 (Boffey and Edwards, 2005, no.1011). Though the five wounds are not explicitly mentioned in the Gospel account of the Crucifixion, in the Later Middle Ages they became a key focus of devotion to Christ\u2019s Passion, and they appeared throughout Europe in a range of artistic and literary formats and in numerous contexts. The cult of the wounds appears to have been particularly popular in England, and remained so even after the Reformation (Duffy, 1992, pp 238\u201348). Latin prayers to the wounds, often illustrated, were frequently included in books of hours, and devotions in English to the wounds were also abundant, with dedicated sermons, prose meditations and verse prayers, many of which incorporated images of the wounds, like the prayer that is my subject here. Following a prefatory image of the five wounds arranged on a shield with a cross and chalice, Christ\u2019s hands, feet and heart are depicted individually in five subsequent images, as a disembodied and bleeding body part (Figures 2\u20136).\nThe wounds are topped with jewelled crowns, and accompanied by banderoles bearing the inscriptions \u2018well of mercy\u2019 (right hand), \u2018well of grace\u2019 (left hand), \u2018well of lyfe\u2019 (\u2018well of life\u2019, the wounded heart), \u2018well of pyte\u2019 (\u2018well of pity\u2019, right foot), and \u2018well of conforte\u2019 (\u2018well of comfort\u2019, left foot), with accompanying prayer verses expanding on the properties of the wounds and their efficacy as a tool for protection from sin.[1] Through the identification of the wounds as \u2018wells\u2019, each wound is given its own distinct identity as an object of devotion, distancing the wounds from the moment of their infliction during Christ\u2019s Passion. In Taylor 17, the wounds of Christ are transformed from signs of his agony and humiliation on the cross into five wells, plentifully flowing with blood as a source of the spiritual benefits of mercy, grace, life, pity and comfort. This analogy between a well and Christ\u2019s wound, or the person of Christ more generally, was a common trope in Late Medieval English devotional texts,[2] but the pictorial and literary imagery of Taylor 17 is notable for its particularly detailed yet simultaneously narrowly focused rumination on the wounds as wells.The most elaborate of the wound-as-well images of Taylor 17 refers to Christ\u2019s side wound as the \u2018well of life\u2019, here depicted as a wounded heart (see Figure 4). It is the largest of the five images of the wounds, and is situated centrally within the text and image sequence. The large red heart floats within the frame, which encloses the image and is presented frontally, confronting the viewer. The pale blue background isolates the heart from any narrative, spatial or temporal specificity, lending it a timeless and eternal quality and obliging the reader to focus solely on the organ itself, removed from Christ\u2019s body and displaying its large wound from which long trails of blood drip downwards. Three flowers emerge from the wound in the centre of the heart and protrude from the top of a large and elaborate bejewelled crown. Each flower is accompanied by a separate text scroll designating them, respectively, as \u2018pyte\u2019, \u2018loue\u2019 and \u2018charyte\u2019, symbolising the divine rewards Christ offers in return for veneration of this central bodily wound. Of the five wounds of Christ depicted in this manuscript, only the heart is shown flowering, yet the presence or significance of the flowers is not expanded upon in the accompanying prayer. In uncovering the source and potential meanings of this iconography, therefore, it is necessary to look beyond the manuscript context to the wider literary and material cultures of Late Medieval England. To appreciate fully the range of meanings of this image of the flowering heart of Christ, I consider here the relationship between this motif and secular love imagery. Scholars such as Jeffrey Hamburger (1990; 1998) and Barbara Newman (2013) have observed the crossover of sacred and secular in Late Medieval images. Hamburger has elucidated the intermingling of sacred imagery and secular romance in manuscripts made and used by nuns in Late Medieval Germany. Allegorical images depicting Christ with the Bride of the Song of Songs as his loving spouse resonated with female audiences who would have been familiar with romance literature, recasting familiar stories in sacred imagery through which nuns could imagine themselves joined with Christ through a bond of love (Hamburger, 1998, p 51). Moreover, Newman\u2019s concept of \u2018Medieval crossover\u2019 proposes that sacred and secular should not be treated as opposing categories; rather, although the sacred remains the default category, the two can \u2018flow together like oil and water, layered but stubbornly distinct. At other times they merge like water and wine, an image dear to mystical writers\u2019 (Newman, 2013, p 7). The image of the flowering heart and its accompanying prayer in Taylor 17 is an example of such a \u2018crossover text\u2019, in which the sacred and the secular are in continual dialogue. Through bringing this image into conversation with contemporary literature, both secular and sacred, and other forms of material culture such as secular love tokens, it is possible to reach an expanded understanding of this unusual iconography and its meanings in the prayer to the wounds of Christ in Taylor 17.The image of the flowering wound in Taylor 17 can be connected with a long theological tradition of Christ\u2019s wounds and blood as sweetly scented or flavoured. Ambrose (c.340\u201397), for example, in his Explanation of the Twelve Psalms, draws attention to the pleasant fragrance exuded by the wounds:\nChrist\u2019s wounds, however, were redolent with the fragrance of grace, not the stench of repentance. Hence it was not death\u2019s decay that flowed from his wounds, as is the case with all other men, but it was the fountain of eternal life (McKinion, 2004, p 113: PL 14.1024c).\nIn imitation of the body of Christ, whose life and Passion was the prototype for all sainthood, saints\u2019 relics could be sweetly scented as a marker of their holiness. Stories of saintly bodies resisting decay, sprouting scented flowers and foliage, and of trees proliferating at their graves, assert both the veracity and the continuing vigour of the relics; they are not dead but alive, and can heal or sustain life in the devout (Brown, 1981, p 76). \u00a0Analogies between flowers and Christ\u2019s body and wounds also appear in Late Medieval English devotional works. In Richard Rolle\u2019s Meditations on the Passion of the early fourteenth century, he refers to the wounded Christ thus:\nSweet Jesu, once again (a comparison): Your body is like a meadow full of scented flowers and health-giving herbs; in just this way, your body is full of wounds, sweetly aromatic for a devout soul and as health-giving as herbs for each sinful man (Allen, 1988, p 114).\nBy invoking the image of a flower-covered meadow, Rolle simultaneously obscures and magnifies the multitude of wounds covering Christ\u2019s body inflicted by scourges, nails and other implements. Like the verse prayer to the heart in Taylor 17, Rolle\u2019s text emphasises the sensory potential of the \u2018scented\u2019 and \u2018sweetly aromatic\u2019 wounds. The fifteenth-century monk and poet John Lydgate also discerned a relationship between Christ\u2019s wounds and flower imagery, exemplified by his poem As a Mydsomer Rose, in which he describes the wounds as \u2018five Roosys\u2019 (five roses) and Christ himself as \u2018roose of the bloody feeld\u2019 (rose of the bloody field), and \u2018roose of Iericho, that greuh in Beedlem\u2019 (rose of Jericho that grew in Bethlehem; McCracken and Sherwood, 1934, pp 780\u201385). Not only are the wounds and body of Christ roses themselves, for Lydgate, the five wounds also \u2018prent in your hert a roose\u2019.[3] This language of \u2018imprinting\u2019 a rose on the reader\u2019s heart in memory of the five wounds reinforces the indelible effect of Christ\u2019s Passion on the reader, and is suggestive both of the reader\u2019s pious remembrance of the Passion, and of the everlasting life that it promises to the faithful.[4]Two images from the late-fifteenth century manuscript known as the \u2018Carthusian Miscellany\u2019 (London, British Library, MS Additional 37049), an illustrated collection of religious works produced in a charterhouse in northern England, develop further the theme of the flowering heart, giving it both visual and textual form, and therefore invite comparison with the flowering heart of Taylor 17. In a variant of the Tree of Life image, the bleeding and crucified Christ is depicted on folio 36 verso, with the monogram of the Holy Name of Jesus wrapping around the branches of the tree.\nThe Virgin and St John are depicted on either side of the cross emerging as \u2018fruit\u2019 from the tree, with other branches bearing red flowers inscribed with the word \u2018luf\u2019 (love). The entire tree emerges from a large red heart pierced with a scroll reading \u2018est amor meus\u2019, which taken with the Holy Name monogram gives the phrase \u2018Jesus est amor meus\u2019 (Jesus is my love). The presence of the kneeling Carthusian monk next to the heart, and the accompanying meditation addressed to Christ (Boffey and Edwards, 2005, no.3416), asking him \u2018receyfe my hert and to \u00fei luf me bryng\u2019 (receive my heart and bring me to your love), implies that the heart is the monk\u2019s own, from which a vision of the crucifixion, and the flowers of Christ\u2019s love bloom, proving the efficacy of the monk\u2019s intense prayer and devotion. A second image also depicts the heart blooming as a result of pious conduct; on folio 62 verso a kneeling Carthusian monk gazes up at a vision of Christ as the Man of Sorrows, supported by angels and revealing his side wound (see Figure 8). Next to the monk, a large red heart labelled \u2018contemplacion\u2019 sprouts a leafy plant bearing the virtues of monastic life, such as \u2018dread\u2019, \u2018faith\u2019 and \u2018poverty\u2019. Among these are \u2018pity\u2019, \u2018love\u2019 and \u2018charity\u2019, the same qualities depicted blooming from the heart in Taylor 17.\nIn both Taylor 17 and \u2018The Carthusian Miscellany\u2019, therefore, appropriate contemplation of Christ\u2019s Passion is understood to propagate spiritual benefits for the devotee. Though Taylor 17 depicts the wounded and flowering heart of Christ, it could also encourage the viewer to contemplate the condition of their own heart, and could visually articulate for the reader their own internal spiritual growth through devotion to Christ\u2019s heart and wounds. In the prayer accompanying the image of the flowering heart, Christ\u2019s heart and the liquid it exudes are described as \u2018helthfull fode\u2019 (healthful food),[5] emphasising that they are a powerful source of nourishment to feed the reader\u2019s own heart, in which pity, love and charity can then grow. Contemplating this image and devoutly reading the accompanying prayer, it is implied, can therefore lead to imitatio Christi, making one\u2019s heart conform to Christ\u2019s. The iconography of Christ\u2019s flowering heart also appears to have been informed by Late Medieval literary and pictorial imagery of courtly love, an examination of which yields insights into the multiple meanings of the flowering heart in the context of this illustrated prayer sequence. The heart had rich and varied meanings in Medieval art and literature, and could function as a metonym for the inner self, and for love, thought and emotion.[6] The gift of the heart was a common trope in both courtly love literature and imagery and in mystical writings. An ivory mirror cover made in Paris c.1300 depicts a kneeling lover offering his heart to a lady, who crowns him with a chaplet.\nThe composition of the scene may derive from the iconography of the Adoration of the Magi (Blamires, 1988, pp 20\u201321). As an object associated with the carnal and erotic gaze, the mirror cover is a suggestive site for the interplay of sacred and secular, and spiritual and carnal, love. As the mirror\u2019s owner gazed into it, they became intimately physically involved with the imagery depicted; the close physical engagement that the mirror cover demands thus unites the spiritual aspects of its imagery with the sensual, bodily experience of the mirror\u2019s user (Sand, 2014, pp 62\u201363). In a later example, the Petit Livre d\u2019Amour of Pierre Sala, a small book of love poems in French approximately contemporary with Taylor 17, Sala is depicted in a full-page miniature giving the gift of his heart to a daisy or marguerite, symbolising his mistress Marguerite Builloud to whom the poems are addressed.[7] Instances of the gift of the heart, or an exchange of hearts with Christ, are also found in the Dialogues of the fourteenth-century mystic Catherine of Siena (Newman, 2013, pp 228\u2013229; Webb, 2010, pp 136\u2013138), and the writings of female monastic communities of thirteenth-century Germany and the Low Countries such as the Beguines and the community at Helfta, whose writings are marked by an intermingling of bridal mysticism with the tropes of courtly love (Newman, 1995; Hamburger, 1998, p 26). Though I do not suggest that these texts were sources for the prayer to the wounds in Taylor 17, they clearly demonstrate how the language and tropes of courtly love could inform and complicate religious writing and imagery to engage the reader-viewer and create shifting and multivalent layers of meaning. In each of these examples of the \u2018gift of the heart\u2019 in sacred and secular contexts, the act is construed as both loving and sacrificial; the lover\u2019s heart torn from their chest is a visceral allegory for their anguish and desire, while also communicating the lover\u2019s hope for spiritual and carnal union with their beloved. It is also illuminating to compare the flowering heart of Taylor 17 with contemporary heart-shaped love token badges, which literalise the metaphorical gift of the heart depicted in the ivory mirror cover and Pierre Sala\u2019s manuscript discussed above. Both manuscript and badge are highly portable objects, intended to be carried on the body and handled on an intimate scale; indeed, the flowering heart depicted in Taylor 17 is similar in size to many extant heart badges, and badges were sometimes sewn into manuscripts by their owners (Rudy, 2011, pp 15\u201319; Foster-Campbell, 2011).[8] The owner of Taylor 17 would likely have been familiar with, and may even have owned, a love token of this kind. Such badges appear to have been widespread; around 50 Medieval pewter heart-shaped badges have been recovered in archaeological excavations in London alone. Some of these badges depict flowers springing from the heart (Spencer, 1998, cat. no. 321e), and some, like the heart in Taylor 17, are crowned and accompanied by banderoles inscribed with text, such as a fifteenth-century example (Spencer, 1998, cat. no. 321d; Gilchrist, 2012, pp 109\u2013111) depicting the heart crowned and emblazoned with a scroll inscribed with the motto \u2018herte be trewe\u2019 (heart be true).\nMore luxurious items of jewellery depicting flowering hearts also survive, such as a gold and enamel brooch, made in England or France in the early fifteenth century (Lightbown, 1992, cat. no. 24), engraved with foliate decoration and the French legend \u2018sanz de partir\u2019 (without being parted).[9] For Late Medieval lovers, flowering heart badges espoused the ideals of fidelity and union in their inscriptions, and communicated desire for the growth and cultivation of romantic and sexual love. In Taylor 17, the image of the flowering heart is invoked not as a gift from one lover to another as part of courtly ritual, or as a symbol of the pleasures to be gained from profane love. Instead, this prayer is concerned with avoiding sin and serving Christ, and the spiritual rewards of pity, love and charity that result from this ideal form of love. Yet the secular love imagery discussed above and the heart in Taylor 17 both foreground the theme of sacrificial love, of the lover giving themselves over to the one desired. The type of love encapsulated by the flowering heart in Taylor 17 necessarily involves sacrifice and suffering as a route to spiritual growth and renewal and, ultimately, to union with Christ. By accepting the gift of Christ\u2019s heart, and freely offering their own in return, the reader-viewer could participate in an act of imitatio Christi. The text accompanying the image of the flowering heart reflects this in its plea that the devotee\u2019s heart will be moved to follow Christ: \u2018And that my herte may so enclyne. The for to serue as one of thyne.\u2019[10] The flowering heart acts as a metonym for Christ\u2019s sacrifice, neatly encapsulating the gruesome corporeal reality of the Passion and its ultimate significance as the source of eternal life for the devout. In Taylor 17, Christ offers up his heart to the viewer, who in turn sacrifices their own heart in order to serve and follow Christ, just as the courtly lover gives the gift of their own heart, either metaphorically or in the form of a heart-shaped token. The interplay of sacred and secular love, and physical and spiritual union, inherent in the flowering heart imbues the love of Christ with a romantic or erotic dimension, while also charging worldly, romantic love with divine significance.As I have begun to show in this brief discussion, the image of the flowering heart and its accompanying prayer in Taylor 17 draws upon and interacts with a rich iconographic tradition of the flowering heart, both sacred and secular. It is a multi-layered devotional tool, which not only draws upon contemporary parallels made between Christ\u2019s body and flowers, as in Rolle\u2019s Meditations on the Passion and \u2018The Carthusian Miscellany\u2019, but also engages closely with the themes and material culture of courtly love to present the reader-viewer with multiple layers of meaning and signification, challenging them to contemplate the many dimensions of love that the image and text make present. Consideration of secular love imagery, such as that of the \u2018gift of the heart\u2019 and secular love tokens contemporary with Taylor 17, leads us to a broader appraisal of the intersections between images of secular and sacred love in the Late Middle Ages and reveals the different ways in which this image can be read as an illustration of the loving relationship between Christ and the reader-viewer. The image of Christ\u2019s flowering heart, pierced with its large central wound and blooming with the flowers of virtue prompts the reader-viewer also to consider their own heart, and the inner transformation that will take place as a result of dedicating their hearts to Christ by reading and viewing the texts and images of this prayer. The image of the flowering heart partially obscures the violence of the Passion and transforms an image of death and torment into one which promises spiritual nourishment and everlasting life, yet simultaneously emphasises the endless nature of Christ\u2019s suffering, and the perpetuity of human sin which lies at the root of that suffering. Fundamentally, then, the flowering heart in Taylor 17 communicates the message which lies at the root of Christianity: the redemption of human sin and the promise of eternal life through Christ\u2019s sacrificial love."},

Firstly, I wanted to experience a museum entirely dedicated to African content. With a total of 11,000m2 of space accessible to the public, the RMCA is one of the largest museums dedicated to Africa in the world. There is no permanent museum space within the UK which is solely dedicated to telling the stories of Africa and or the African diaspora (let alone Central Africa). Hence the RMCA provides an example of what a museum focused on the stories of the African diaspora in the UK could look like. Secondly, since the Museum\u2019s creation in 1898 the RMCA has always been a dual museum and scientific institute, and \u2018even today, two thirds of the staff and the budget of the Africa Museum are dedicated to scientific research\u2019 (RMCA, 2018b). The connections between science and colonialism have been historically downplayed. With many science institutions viewing themselves as purveyors of scientific truths, rather than acknowledging the biases they hold whilst undertaking scientific practice. Ethnographic museums are often singled out as institutions which hold the most visible links to practices of colonialism. This, however, lulls non-ethnographic institutions into a false security, and it is important to acknowledge the ways in which science (art, and other discipline-led museums) have been used to empower and legitimise colonial attitudes within Belgium. Thirdly I wanted to assess the effectiveness of the decolonisation of the space, for me personally as a visitor of African heritage, but also as an exemplar for other museums. What can Britain learn from the remodelling of the RMCA? Will it be possible to duplicate a similar process in Britain\u2019s colonial institutions? My final motivation related more generally to learning about Belgian-Congolese relations and history. Having visited Belgium the year before the new museum opened, I had seen countless examples of King Leopold\u2019s wealth all over the capital city. King Leopold personally oversaw the colonisation of the Congo (known then \u2013 rather ironically \u2013 as the Congo Free State), which involved pillaging Congolese wealth before the country was annexed by Belgium in 1908. How would the 8\u201310 million people killed by Leopold\u2019s regime be respected and memorialised throughout the museum? (Hochschild, 2012, p 3). I hoped that I would be shown signs of Central African resilience throughout the \u2018decolonised\u2019 RMCA space."},

A close reading of the geological and palaeontological information presented there alongside the ways in which the public, the press and even the Queen herself engaged with these innovative models, reveals that this second Crystal Palace functioned as a discursive site of exchange between deep past and present. Naturalists imported former worlds into the nineteenth century for the benefit of public edification, but the concerns of the present simultaneously colonised the past. Ultimately, though, the discourse was unbalanced. Through guidebooks and press reports, Victorians visiting the Crystal Palace were encouraged to push back against the overwhelming scale of geological history by relating to the animals and minerals of deep time in terms of contemporary national borders and human affairs. Moreover, naturalists and their audiences celebrated geological and palaeontological materials as local resources and capitalised on their economic and intellectual worth, naturalising them just as Dickens had done in the opening lines to Bleak House.Like the Hyde Park Great Exhibition of 1851, the Crystal Palace at Sydenham, located south of the Thames, was designed to celebrate the advance of Britain and other \u2018civilised\u2019 nations. It was hoped that visitors to the grounds would feel compelled to admire the cultural and technological apogee over which Victoria reigned, after consuming the art, science and industry collected in this venue. Though a private venture overseen by the newly incorporated Crystal Palace Company, this permanent palace at Sydenham echoed the ideals and aims of the earlier, nationally funded exhibition. An article in The Times observed that the Crystal Palace \u2018aspires to be, and is recognised, as national\u2019 (Piggott, 2004). Queen Victoria assented to this unofficial affiliation by presiding over the opening ceremonies on 10 June 1854, just as she had done in 1851. Designed by Joseph Paxton to imitate a botanical conservatory, the new glass palace perched upon a hilltop overlooked pastoral Surrey and Kent on one side, the buildings of London on the other. The panoply of exhibits it contained would have astounded even those visitors who had previously witnessed the Great Exhibition. There were natural history and ethnological displays alongside industrial exhibits celebrating advances in machinery, furniture making, perfumery and textiles. The portraiture, sculpture and architectural reconstructions were to be appreciated for both their aesthetic and didactic qualities. The palace grounds presented still more wonders. The waterworks and manicured gardens just outside the glass building demonstrated a domesticated nature, while the geological section situated at the very bottom of the park invited visitors to learn about an untamed antediluvian world through models of extinct animals and displays of geological stratification. This final exhibit claimed to illustrate the \u2018native state\u2019 of England and its animal inhabitants. Located at the very edge of the park, geological strata and replicas of the extractive industries that monetised the minerals discovered in these rocks revealed the resources that funded and fuelled imperial power (MacDermott, 1854: 176\u2013178).The goal of the geological section aligned with that of the palace in general, to communicate \u2018a divinely ordained model of progress culminating in the Victorian period\u2019. Moreover, palace and park designer Joseph Paxton and his collaborators, including geologist David Thomas Ansted and Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins, the naturalist and artist who sculpted the extinct models, hoped that visitors would leave their exhibit recognising \u2018the wondrous diversity of God\u2019s universe\u2019 (MacDermott, 1854: 20). By referring to these extinct animals as \u2018antediluvian monsters\u2019 and \u2018pre-Adamite beasts\u2019, Hawkins and Richard Owen, who was brought in at a late stage to lend credence to the exhibit through his well-known name and reputation as a comparative anatomist, museum curator and public promoter of science, situated these creatures within a Judeo-Christian narrative, as did many other nineteenth-century naturalists (Secord, 2004: 154-5). Ansted and Hawkins augmented this rhetorical relationship by positioning the fearsome reconstructions upon stratified islands in a lake, which was intended to suggest the biblical flood. The figurative and visual links to Genesis \u2018embedded the creatures in a biblical temporality\u2019 familiar to most visitors (Marshall, 2007: 295). Prior to this exhibition, encounters with lost worlds had been reserved for those who studied extinct animals. As Martin Rudwick (2010: 1\u20132) explains, naturalists had \u2018developed a conceptual time-machine\u2019 that allowed these privileged few to \u2018burst the limits of time\u2019. The geological section of the Crystal Palace instead offered a more egalitarian form of time travel. Here any Londoner able to afford the entrance fee could spend an afternoon strolling through an English park as it was imagined to have looked during previous geological periods.[3]"},

The paper has two overarching objectives: firstly, it will reflect on the way displays of science and technology were delivered in the Science Museum in the 1960s. Based on the example of this temporary exhibition, the paper will suggest that display strategies commonly thought of as having originated in the 1980s can in fact be traced back some decades earlier. Indeed, analysis of documents suggests that some of these ideas were around in the 1950s: for example the use of a few and \u2018ruthlessly selected\u2019 (Nahum, 2010, p 189) exhibits instead of whole collections, or the idea that scientific and technical artefacts have an aesthetic value meriting forms of displays similar to those found in sculpture galleries and art museums.\nThe paper will suggest that temporary exhibitions prove particularly helpful for questioning received assumptions about the development of museum display techniques and policies. Permanent galleries, which often remain unchanged for at least two or three decades, are not flexible enough to serve as indexes of changes in museum practices in relation to changes in the wider cultural context (MacDonald, 1996). By contrast, temporary exhibitions enable us to acquire a detailed historical understanding of the development of museum practices on an almost yearly basis (Morris, 2010b).\nAs a second objective, this paper is intended as a modest contribution to the literature arguing for the significance of visual artefacts (such as photographs) as sources for historiography (Jordanova, 2012). The departure point for this article is itself a photograph depicting the Freedom 7 special exhibition, which was taken for the explicit purpose of documenting the physical form of the exhibition (Figure 1).\nThis paper shows that a close reading of such visual records, regarding the choice of exhibits and the architecture of the display, leads to new conclusions about the historical significance of the display, and adds to any understanding of museum practices gained from textual sources alone. Photographs allow us, as distant observers, to engage with material aspects of a display that often embody unarticulated museological skills and understandings. These skills and understandings are often tacit and remain unacknowledged by museum professionals. They are thus invisible in the written records produced by the historical actors who set up exhibitions.\nVisual records analysed in conjunction with written ones also enable us to get a more detailed understanding of the conceptions museum curators held of visitors, what they thought visitors\u2019 expectations were, and how they thought these expectations should be taken into account when constructing the display (Schmid, 2006). The present paper will suggest that such conception, in the case of the Science Museum in the mid-1960s, revolved around notions of entertainment and self-improvement.\nThis paper is intended to engage with the display as a material artefact, as a constructed thing, in a way that allows us to retrieve as much as possible of the agency of those who produced but also consumed it (Alder, 2007). It therefore contributes to the literature reflecting on the history of the material construction of displays, which has already covered a lot of ground[1].\nIn particular, Ghislaine Lawrence (1996) has usefully drawn attention to \u2018the spectacular\u2019 as a meaningful category for understanding the history of those aspects of exhibition, mostly visual, whose \u2018handling ... is rooted in practices which have become conventionalized, largely unacknowledged and often self-imposed by curators and designers\u2019 (p 69). The specific contribution of the present paper is to offer, through the close study of an individual case, a more detailed understanding of the history of display practices at the Science Museum during the mid-1960s.\nThe period can be thought of as significant for the Science Museum, for it follows the start in May 1964 of the television series Horizon. We may thus expect that this development in the British mediascape led to some evolution in the Museum\u2019s visual language. Indeed, as I discuss elsewhere (Gouyon, 2014), historical evidence shows that staff at the Science Museum perceived the development of BBC2, and of Horizon in particular, as elements they should take into account when thinking of what the Museum could offer. For instance, the annual report of the Science Museum for 1964 contains the following remark:\n\u2018out-of-school background science programmes are increasing in number and quality especially with the introduction of B.B.C.2 and to an ever-increasing extent are sating the public appetite for science lectures. Why should a family party spend a considerable amount of time and money to travel to the Science Museum for a lecture when they have a weekly choice of several first class science programmes on their own hearth?\u2019[2]\nAs the present paper suggests, such awareness of the concurrence represented by science television programmes will translate, on the one hand, into a foregrounding of the Museum\u2019s capacity to offer visitors the possibility of experiencing the presence of historical artefacts, and on the other into some form of reassertion of the Museum\u2019s expertise in producing historical knowledge of science and technology. This latter idea was not alien to Science Museum staff in the 1960s (Anthony, 2010). In 1955 already, Frank Sherwood Taylor (then Director of the Museum) forcefully asserted that \u2018the object of the Museum may on this view be stated briefly as to exhibit the achievements, wonder, importance and history of science\u2019[3].\nIn what follows, I will firstly give an account of the exhibition, based on textual records: the Science Museum\u2019s archives contain detailed papers related to the display. Secondly, I will discuss photographic records of the exhibition and show that analysing them enables a more textured description of the display, which in turn brings a deeper understanding than could have been obtained from texts alone. Lastly, I will suggest an intellectual genealogy for the display strategy exemplified in the Freedom 7 special exhibition. It appears indeed that the layout of the 1965 exhibition can be related to some of the reflection conducted in the preceding decade on how scientific and technological knowledge should be put on display. This is evidenced by a note on the topic authored by Keeper of Astronomy Henry Calvert in 1950, and recently discovered in the Science Museum\u2019s archives (Calvert, 1950). Overall, the present article will propose that there is a relationship between this temporary exhibition and the development of the Science Museum in the 1960s, especially with regard to its appropriation of space science, as manifested by a nascent collection of artefacts related to the topic."},

This was an epithet given to the machine by an unidentified journalist in the United States some time during 1929 or 1930 (Markel, 1998: 75).[3] The term appears to have been first used in the UK on 23 March 1933 in the Belfast Telegraph where it was said that a boy had been \u2018put into an artificial respirator machine, or what is known as the \u201ciron lung\u201d\u2019 (Anon, 1933).\u00a0 However, NPVs in the UK were not made of iron for long. Only two years after Drinker and Shaw\u2019s version of the NPV was built, John Emmerson built a lighter and cheaper machine using aluminium. In 1938, Lord Nuffield made a vast donation of Both type \u2018iron lungs\u2019 to hospitals across the Empire. These NPVs were designed by the Australian John Both as a cheap and lightweight alternative and were made of plywood rather than iron (McGuire et al, 2020).[4] Despite the material reality of the machines, they were most commonly known by the Americanism \u2018iron lung\u2019, a term that became eponymous in French, German and English (Gould, 1995: 90). Thus the term \u2018iron lung\u2019 was a constructed descriptor of the NPV. It was not the same as the material reality of the object, but, I argue, described the lived experience, providing a shared and logical understanding of what the apparatus meant to the people that interacted with it both physically and conceptually (Voeglin, 2016: 64). The term \u2018iron lung\u2019 became eponymous for respirators in the UK during the first half of the twentieth century. This article offers some insight into how and why this came to be. Early metaphorical uses of the phrase \u2018iron lung\u2019 described steam engines, orators\u2019 voices, artillery fire and large crowds, drawing on themes of modernity and sound. I argue that there was a \u2018transference of feeling\u2019 that reflected these ideas from earlier metaphoric use to the real and imagined sensory experiences of these new machines by those who interacted with them (Ricoeur, 2003: 124).\nThere have been a number of important accounts by those who found themselves placed within the NPV having lost their capacity to breathe (Alexander, 1955; Mason, 2003; Presley, 2008; Rudulph, 1984; Woods, 1994). While offering unique insights into user experiences, Kerry Highly (2016: 7) has noted the socio-economic background of those able to write such narratives excluded accounts from minorities and poorer communities, which through public funding campaigns such as the March of the Dimes were already under represented.[5] Some, like Highley, have brought to light these under-represented narratives with oral histories and archival research that draw piecemeal moments from survivors\u2019 lives, though the primary focus has remained American (Gould, 1995; Highley, 2016; Ott, 2016; Silver and Wilson, 2007). These patient narratives are highly personal, and in their rawness they allow little room for broader theoretical considerations. When patient narratives are utilised as part of more theoretically grounded historical works the focus tends to be on the story of polio (Gould, 1995; Highley, 2016). The majority of works that have tackled the history of polio have pointed toward the iron lung as an often horrifying symbol of the disease (Gould, 1995; Abraham, 2018; Berg, 1946; Daniel and Robbins, 1997; De La Bedoyere, 2005; Fisher, 1967; Kluger, 2004; Markel, 1998; Mawdsley, 2016; Paul, 1971; Seytre and Shaffer, 2004; Smallman-Ryanor et al, 2006; Wilson, 1963). Seytre and Shaffer noted that the name \u2018iron lung\u2019 \u2018helped conjure up the terror that polio inspired in the public\u2019s mind\u2019; however, they do not delve into the implications of this statement (Seytre and Shaffer, 2004: 41). Deeper exploration of the metaphors that we use can highlight and \u2018make sense of\u2019 our experiences (Clow, 2016: 310). This article will trace some of the metaphorical uses of the term \u2018iron lung\u2019 over time in the UK, arguing that this use of language suggests interesting new ways of thinking about public perception of user experiences of this significant life-saving technology. This article is based upon a consideration of all appearances of the term \u2018iron lung\u2019 in the British Newspaper Archive (BNA) between 1750 and 1938.[6] Newspapers became the most profitable and dynamic print form by the end of the nineteenth century and were \u2018securely implanted into the cultural landscape as an essential reference point in the daily lives of millions of people\u2019 (Jones, 2016: 2\u20133). The ubiquitous nature of newspapers in nineteenth and early twentieth century life allows historical access to both cultural and linguistic trends. Thus, they are used here to consider popular understanding and use of metaphors. This paper uses the BNA as a primary source as it provides coverage from across the UK thus avoiding limiting the discussion to a London-centred perspective, as consideration of, for example, The Times newspaper archive would provide.[7] To contextualise these newspaper articles, the paper also considers biographies and other media. The primary aim of this article is to explore the metaphorical uses of the phrase \u2018iron lung\u2019 prior to the invention of the Drinker type respirator (the first negative pressure ventilator to be labelled as such) and the first decade of its use in the United Kingdom up to, and including, the year of Lord Nuffield\u2019s substantial donation of Both type lungs in 1938. It will be noted that familiar uses of the metaphor engaged with both human and non-human sound and modernity, both positively and negatively construed. The \u2018iron lung\u2019 therefore came with baggage. Far from causing dissonance for perceptions of the NPV this baggage instead seems to have made the term eponymous in the UK, not only for Drinker respirators but for all forms of NPV, even encompassing positive pressure ventilators such as the Bragg-Paul (McGuire et al, 2020: 6). By the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries \u2018iron lungs\u2019 were embodied in public and user perceptions of the NPV."},

However, all the accepted skills became ineffective in the face of a new challenge \u2013 the invention of the firearm.\nToday, the most revolutionary method of gunshot wounds management is mainly attributed to the French surgeon Ambroise Par\u00e9 (1510\u20131590) (Duma\u020btre, 1986), royal surgeon to four kings of France (Henry II, Charles X, Henry III and Henry IV). Par\u00e9 practiced as a battle-field surgeon in the last Italian wars (1542\u20131546 and 1551\u20131559) and in the Religious wars in France (1562\u20131598) so he experienced first-hand the urgent need to find a way to treat this entirely new type of wound. In this paper we will discuss the context in which his treatment was developed and we will analyse how his methods were received by Par\u00e9\u2019s contemporaries and their place in the development of contemporary surgery.\nThough the first use of firearms in Europe took place in the battle of Cr\u00e9cy in 1346, there were not many guns in existence at this time, and they were not used regularly in military conflict before the second half of the fifteenth century (Chase, 2003). Although the range of these early firearms was no more than 15 metres and firing accuracy left much to be desired, a bullet could still punch through metal armour and was more deadly than an arrow from a crossbow. An important feature of gunshot wounds was the kinetic impact of the hot bullet. In addition, lead bullets shattered when hitting a target (armour, clothes or a body) and the damage caused often spread wider than the diameter of the entry wound. Foreign bodies which got into the wound channel (mostly fragments of clothes) caused inflammation, suppuration, then sepsis and death.\nKelly DeVries argues that medieval surgeons practiced two different ways of curing wounds. One was cauterisation with a hot iron, but the second method (recommended by Henri de Mondeville, a fourteenth-century French royal surgeon, among others) was to cleanse the wounds with balm or ointment (DeVries, 1990, pp 135\u2013137). Both methods were widely used for treating patients and we do not know exactly how effective they were, but the advent of firearms created new tasks for military surgeons. Mortality from gunshot wounds was much greater than that inflicted by steel weapons; extraction of bullets and foreign bodies, such as chards of cannonballs, had a greater effect on the body than the extraction of an arrow. Nevertheless, only a few surgeons of this period conceptualised gunshot wounds as being of a different nature to the wounds made by cold steel.\nAs there was no ancient tradition to explain the mechanism of this kind of wounding, it became necessary to look for new explanations. In 1497, a German surgeon, Hieronymus Brunschwig (1450\u20131533), published The Book of treating gunshot wounds (Buch der Wund Artzney) (Brunschwig, 1497). He was probably the first to argue that gunshot wounds were poisoned. Saltpetre, an integral part of gunpowder, was already considered a poison, and Brunschwig also argued that the appearance of gunshot wounds was reminiscent of the wounds caused by poisoned arrows or the bites of mad dogs and poisonous animals. It was Brunschwig who suggested that such wounds be treated with cauterisation, following the practice of ancient physicians when treating poisoned injuries and continuing the belief that fire would halt the effects of poison (Sigerist, 1946; Shane Tubbs et al, 2011).\nBrunschwig\u2019s reasoning seems to be typical of the time: death that could not be explained by medical practitioners was often understood to be the result of poisoning (Collard, 2003). According to this theory, the common symptoms of gunshot wounds such as fever, physical debility, a blue hue to skin, vomiting and mental confusion, were all explained as the effects of \u2018poison matter\u2019 penetrating the body together with the bullet and gunshot powder.\nBrunschwig\u2019s treatise was written in German and was not translated into Latin or any other language. Thus, it was not familiar to French surgeons. It is worth noting that in the sixteenth century, Latin ceased to be the lingua franca of scientific communication, as vernacular languages were increasingly adapted (Olschki, 1927). In one sense this increasing vernacularisation of surgical texts increased the spread of knowledge since they could now be accessed by non-university educated medical practitioners (Siraisi, 2001, pp 37\u201349). In sixteenth-century France, for example, the members of the surgical community Saint-C\u00f4me published their textbooks in French, thereby raising the status of their profession in France. (Brockliss, Jones, 1997, p 104). However, this trend also limited the audience of a particular text to a linguistic region. Without access to Brunschwig, most European surgeons learned about the method of cauterisation of gunshot wounds through the writings of Giovanni da Vigo (1450/60\u20131525) whose book Practice and Surgery (La Practique et Cirurgie, 1542) became the medical bestseller of the sixteenth century. Da Vigo\u2019s work was published in Latin, French, German, Italian and English for almost two centuries and was thus very widely available. The last edition appeared in 1713.\nDa Vigo argued (p 224) that there are three distinctive features of a gunshot wound: 1) mechanical lesion (contusio); 2) the burn from the hot bullet and gunshot powder (combustio); and 3) intoxication of gunshot powder (intoxicatio). The two first points were adapted and accepted, but it was with the concept of intoxicatio (or poisoning) that European surgeons struggled with in the sixteenth century.\nDa Vigo\u2019s recommendations followed the ancient medical principles in many respects (Mounier-Kuhn, 2006, pp 155\u2013156). But in emphasising three different impacts, he argued that the management of a gunshot wound is much more complicated than the treatment of a blade weapon wound. While acknowledging that ancient surgeons had no experience of such injuries, da Vigo nevertheless resorted to the authority of Galen who taught that if a person experienced two or more illnesses at the same time, the medical practitioner was to treat the most dangerous. Considering intoxicatio a fatal danger, da Vigo prescribed treatment with hot liquids, for instance boiling olive oil. This method was based on the ancient tradition of curing wounds made with poisoned arrows. According to modern surgical practice, the perceived effect of high temperature liquids on the gunshot wound can be explained by the coagulation of tissues, which da Vigo and his contemporaries understood as stopping the absorption of poison or rendering the poison inactive while healing.\nThus, da Vigo seems to have created the first theory-driven approach to curing gunshot wounds. He described the steps of gunshot wound management: the first one is cauterisation with boiling oil to stop the effects of gunpowder poison. The cauterisation provokes an iatrogenic burn, i.e. one caused by the treatment, which was understood to be less dangerous than poisoning. The next step was to treat the burn. For wound treatment after cauterisation, da Vigo recommended several remedies, for example a barley decoction with earthworms and a digestive potion[1] of turpentine, rose oil and egg yolk."},

Firstly, the subject of the Essay is scrofula, an affliction characterised by large swellings of the lymph nodes. We now know that the swellings can be caused by the same mycobacteria responsible for tuberculosis. In the eighteenth century, however, there was less consensus over scrofula\u2019s causes and the affliction could prove fatal if it led to festering ulcers and amputations. Even in non-fatal cases, the swellings and deformities the infection produced were likely to have been socially debilitating, especially for the young who have always been \u2013 on account of the way the lymphoid system develops \u2013 more susceptible to lymphadenopathy (Cohen, Powderly, Opal, 2010, p 164). Morley\u2019s experiences reflected this; he added a table to the eighth edition of the Essay which described the age and sex of two thousand of his patients: most were under thirty (1363) and the majority of these were female (800) (Morley, 1772, p 57). These young women perhaps suffered more severe social consequences from the cosmetic damage scrofula wrought. \u00a0Morley\u2019s pamphlet was published several decades after a turning point in scrofula\u2019s history. From the Middle Ages through to the death of Queen Anne in 1714, scrofula was treatable through \u2018the royal touch\u2019: this was a large and carefully staged ceremony, in which patients who had exhausted all natural remedies could have their swellings healed by the divinely anointed hands of the English monarch (Brogan, 2015, p 60). This is how scrofula became known as the King\u2019s Evil. After Queen Anne\u2019s death, however, the Hanoverian monarch, George I, discontinued this miraculous healing ceremony, possibly because of its Catholic and Stuart associations (Brogan, 2015, pp 204\u20135). So, although natural remedies for scrofula had always been advocated, they acquired a new significance after 1714. There were certainly many texts advertising them at the time of Morley\u2019s Essay but, judging by the smaller number of editions produced, none seems to have been quite as steady a seller.[2] Historians of medicine have paid little attention to these eighteenth-century writings, focusing instead on the social, political and religious implications of the royal touch (Bloch, 1961; Crawford, 1977; Levin; 1989; Turrell, 1999; Brogan, 2015).[3]Many of these overlooked eighteenth-century texts on scrofula were issued as pamphlets; indeed, Morley (1776, p 83) describes his Essay as a \u2018Twelve-Penny Pamphlet\u2019. What would this label have signalled to eighteenth-century readers? Pamphlets were defined for taxation purposes by the 1712 Stamp Act as books which did not exceed 96 pages when produced in octavo format (Raymond, 2003, p 82; Bayman, 2016, p 6). However, they could also be produced in quarto and were usually sold unbound with the pages simply stitched together. They were thus characterised by being small, thin, and cheap to produce and many were accessible to a broader cross-section of the population than other kinds of books (Halasz, 1997, pp 16\u201317). This market appeal made pamphlets a popular form for writers, printers and booksellers, who did not need to risk large investments of time and money in their production. In fact, printing and re-printing pamphlets that were proven bestsellers could provide booksellers with enough financial security to stock more costly volumes (Bayman, 2016, p 7). Seventeenth-century pamphlets associated with topical social issues and political controversies have been well-studied. Although eighteenth-century pamphlets have been discussed in large-scale publishing studies (e.g. St. Clair, 2004, pp 256, 277\u201378, 309, 562), less scholarship has been devoted solely to them; this is despite the fact that production of all types of books and pamphlets soared in the second half of the eighteenth century due to growing demand, improved distribution networks and increased organisation within the bookselling trades (Raven, 2007, 130\u201331). Medical pamphlets and the ways in which readers engaged with them have been particularly understudied, though there have been a few in-depth analyses of particular writers, controversies and styles (e.g. Newman, 1994; Fissell, 2007, pp 120\u201327). Furthermore, recent work on other ephemeral medical forms, such as handbills (Guerrini, 2010) and advertisements (Forman Cody, 1999; Barker, 2009; Strachan, 2007; Mackintosh, 2017), has developed important insights into the ways that trust and authority were cultivated and the ways that academic discourse interacted with more widely accessible medical ideas. These studies all provide useful models for approaching Morley\u2019s pamphlet. Another useful model is Deborah Madden\u2019s study of John Wesley\u2019s eighteenth-century pamphlet, Primitive Physic; Or an Easy and Natural Method of Curing Most Diseases. This was a short compendium of medical recipes for healing all kinds of ailments (Madden, 2007). John Wesley had much in common with Morley: he did not have a formal medical qualification; his professed reason for publishing the pamphlet was to help the poor, and his recipe collection shared a practical and therapeutic emphasis with later versions of Morley\u2019s Essay, allegedly providing simple, homely cures that even poor labourers could make. As Madden (2007) has shown, however, Wesley\u2019s reading and intellectual influences were wide-ranging; Morley\u2019s engagement with academic writings (discussed below) might seem similarly surprising given that \u2013 like Wesley \u2013 he was associated by his opponents and critics with anti-intellectual, folk remedies. Both texts therefore show us that academic discourse could inform even the simplest, most widely accessible writings: both were pocketsize and concise and were advertised at the same affordable price of one shilling. Like Morley\u2019s pamphlet, Primitive Physic stands out from similar titles because it went through many more editions: 23 editions were produced during Wesley\u2019s lifetime and the 37th and last edition was produced in 1859, over one hundred years after the first edition was published (Madden, 2007, p 11). Like Morley, Wesley was assiduous in tweaking and updating his text across these editions, correcting errors and adding new recipes. The ease and cheapness with which pamphlets could be revised and reprinted was probably a large part of their appeal for both authors: it meant that knowledge could be supplemented; reader and reviewer feedback could be incorporated and, as we shall see, authorial identity could be continually refashioned. It probably also contributed to the pamphlets\u2019 ongoing appeal to buyers: title pages advertising a \u2018new\u2019 or \u2018revised\u2019 text could convince readers that they were purchasing cutting-edge knowledge. The comforting familiarity of the author\u2019s name by later editions possibly also served as a stamp of authority. But pamphlets had negative associations as well: the rapidity with which they were printed and written meant they could be associated with sloppy writing skills, a lack of intellectual rigour and demeaning commercial motivations (Bayman, 2016, pp 13\u201315, 19; Raymond, 2002, pp 7\u201311). Pamphlets advertising medical services and products were especially susceptible to negative associations with \u2018quacks\u2019: as Roy Porter has shown, this capacious term of abuse was often deployed in eighteenth-century polemic to describe practitioners \u2013 both educated and unlearned, qualified and amateur \u2013 who used wide-reaching printed forms such as pamphlets, broadsides and newspapers to sell inefficacious cures to gullible patients (Porter, 1989, pp 1\u201320).[4] Harold Cook (1986, p 43) suggests that, compared to broadsides, pamphlets were considered a more respectable medium for eighteenth-century orthodox physicians: they were more informative and less obviously commercial. But the concerns associated with any kind of mass publishing still affected pamphlet writers: William Vickers, the author of another eighteenth-century pamphlet on scrofula, expressed such unease when he proclaimed that \u2018this way of publishing Medicines and Cures is now esteemed Quackism...\u2019 (Vickers, 1709, p 11).Because of these associations, readers of medical pamphlets also risked being denigrated as gullible and naive; pamphlets on all subjects had long been belittled as \u2018toyes, trifles, trash, [and] trinkets\u2019 (Greene, 1583, sig. A3; Bayman, 2016, p 15). In their attempts to move beyond such polemic, and discover the diverse ways in which readers actually engaged with pamphlets and other small books, scholars have been hampered by a lack of evidence: many copies of these books do not survive and those which do frequently contain no material traces of readers\u2019 engagements with them (Fissell, 1992, p 88). This is another reason why John Morley\u2019s pamphlet \u2013 and the significant number of copies surviving in repositories around the world \u2013 are so valuable: not only do some copies survive with annotations, but the testimonials Morley includes in later editions contain information from readers about how they extracted information from the pamphlet. As we shall see, these show that even short, seemingly formulaic texts could invite a variety of complex reader responses."},

The book begins with a preface to the series introducing the two stated goals: \u2018to encourage effective use of objects in the studies of history of science and technology\u2026and to bring together curators and academic historians.\u2019 (Finn, 2019).\u00a0 This particular volume is from Artefacts 12 and seeks to examine the complex tensions and synergies in the public display of scientific collections in the twentieth century across science museums, international and national exhibitions and fairs. There are twelve essays organised into three sections: Nineteenth Century Legacy: History and Heroes; Rethinking Science Display: Interwar Exhibitions; and Postwar Exhibitions: What is the Role of Artifacts? These sections are preceded by an introduction by the editors and drawn together in conclusion by Professor Robert Friedel, University of Maryland.\nThe first two essays of the book examine the legacy of the nineteenth-century exhibitions and their alignment and use in narratives of nationhood. The ability for exhibitions to use objects to strengthen national identity is a feature of many of the articles in this book but in this first section using \u2018personalities\u2019 as a focus for display is emphasised. The emergence in the use of collection objects is examined particularly in the first essay where the instruments and documents relating to the history of French chemists in the 1900 World Exhibition in Paris prompted conversations around a permanent form of display.\nThe middle section of the publication is the largest and examines the inter-war period across six essays. Unsurprisingly, the focus on nationalism is powerful here as many of the authors explain how exhibitions and displays became the tools of various nations to assert their dominance and reinforce their identity. This section of the book has a strong Italian flavour but is complemented by case studies in Spain, the USA and France. Of particular interest is the debate that arises in the essays over changes in audience engagement with the perennial tension between didactic displays and more engaging presentations. Above the now-familiar debate around \u2018dumbing down\u2019 displays are some interesting dissections concerning the position of collections objects in the communication of theoretical scientific principles and contemporary science.\nThe final section of the publication brings the debate into the Space Age and concentrates on the use of this new frontier in the context of the Cold War. Again, exhibitions and displays are drawn into a struggle of national dominance and the broader debate about different approaches to interpretation is at the fore. In an echo of the first section of the book, the influence of world fairs on the establishment of permanent science museums/centres is examined and how national priorities can change the prominence and interpretation that domestic displays can take.\nThe book is well structured and easy for the reader to navigate. Its chronological order, with the latter essays picking up on themes and events in earlier articles, helps to draw the reader through some of the unifying themes despite the specificity of the individual pieces. The introduction admirably brings together the collections of essays, framing their inclusion in the publication and drawing out some universal ideas. For a general reader, one could imagine it might be tempting to pair the introduction with the conclusion, dipping into the various essays that hold interest or relevance rather than read the book cover to cover. Of course, the specificity of the essays reflects their origin as conference papers in a specialised field. Perhaps, a broader more general publication on the subject of science and technology displays in the twentieth century would provide a good precursor to this publication. That said, each of the essays is well formulated and argued, providing interesting if niche insights into the topic. The book certainly surprises with gems of knowledge that one would be hard-pressed to come across elsewhere and gives interesting concepts to consider in today\u2019s interpretive practice.\n\u00a0"},

First opened in 1948, the Museum set out to represent the lived experience of the Welsh through a selection of historic buildings, plucked from their original locations across the nation and rebuilt in its idyllic grounds. It is now one of Wales\u2019 most popular visitor attractions, and for many who grew up in Wales, like me, it is a place of fond school-trip memories where one entered a strange, but familiar, mini historic Wales.\nIn 2018, the Museum completed its six-year \u2018Making History\u2019 redevelopment project, which saw \u00a330 million invested in improved education facilities and new exhibition spaces. In their essay included within Janes and Sandell\u2019s edited volume, Museum Activism, St Fagans curators Sioned Hughes and Elen Philips emphasise that the project allowed not only for physical changes, but for a conceptual redevelopment towards becoming an activist museum (2019, p 245). For St Fagans, activism is framed as being a museum working with rather than for its communities \u2013 working more collaboratively to form a democratic model for museums which benefits interests beyond those of the curators and conservators. One example during the project is the Museum\u2019s apprenticeship scheme with the redevelopment contractors, one way of ensuring direct community benefit by offering people skills and employment.\nAs they explain, this ambition is present within the Museum\u2019s history, as its founder, Iorwerth Peate, was keen for St Fagans to not simply preserve the past, but to benefit the welfare of future communities (Peate, 1948). This forward-thinking approach mirrors the aims of the Wellbeing of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015, which requires Welsh public bodies, including national museums, to frame their objectives against the Act\u2019s aims of sustainable economic, social, environmental and cultural development in Wales. As such, St Fagans\u2019 activist approach during and since the \u2018Making Histories\u2019 project derives from both an internal ambition, as well as wider political initiatives, towards improving lives in Wales.\nBeing familiar with St Fagans as a place of nostalgia I am keen to see how, now that the \u2018Making History\u2019 project is complete, the Museum\u2019s ambition to be forward thinking, through activist and democratic approaches, translates into the general visitor\u2019s experience. For my visit, I will focus on the newly redeveloped gallery spaces \u2013 Life Is, Wales Is and Gweithdy. Though much behind-the-scenes work has been conducted, will St Fagans be able to clearly present activist ideas, and a democratic approach, within the most traditional aspect of any museum: the exhibitions?"},

The figure holds a staff and the left arm supports an asymmetrical floral spray rising up behind and forming a frame for the circular drum containing the clock and dial. The figure is here identified as Minerva, combining male and female attributes, floral-patterned dress, and a soldier\u2019s helmet.\nWhile the front of the piece presents exceptionally fine craftsmanship, the rear view is less harmonious (see Figure 3), the repouss\u00e9 silverwork having no backing as might be expected, and the reverse of the main body being supported with a somewhat inelegant triple strut of silver straps, soldered behind the figure to stiffen the whole assembly. The back of the clock movement is protected with the jointed, domed silver cover bearing the engraved citation, but there was originally a second, inner cover, now missing, but for which the steel retaining clips (now heavily corroded) survive inside the case. There are no hallmarks or signatures to be seen on the silver, so the identity of the silversmith, discussed later in this article, remains conjectural.\nThe piece was evidently always intended to be a clock, and must have always been a standalone piece. The bezel, with a convex glass protecting the dial, was fixed shut with three radial screws and the hand-setting and winding every day were effected by picking up the clock and turning round, so it has always been portable, in this form. \u00a0Although we believe that the silver body was created to be what we see today, the ebonised wooden base upon which the silver body sits is aesthetically and practically rather small for it. The shell scrolling extending beyond the base feels odd, but perhaps is part of the original design and was intended to emphasise the extravagant rococo nature of the whole. The base is attached to the silver body with two threaded silver bolts (see Figure 4) which pass through the base and are secured with four-lobed nuts underneath, entirely as one might expect for the period.\n\u00a0"},

Born into an upper-middle class family with liberal-humanitarian views, Nightingale was raised in privilege. She and her sister, Parthenope, were educated to university level at home by their father, who taught them mathematics, Latin and Greek. Outside of their studies, the sisters were introduced to a wide range of intellectuals by their parents, including the mathematician Charles Babbage (Magnello, 2010, p 18).\nAn enthusiastic mathematician from an early age, Nightingale began taking private lessons with a Cambridge-trained mathematician at the age of twenty. Statistics became her primary mathematical interest; indeed, she would later call it \u2018the most important science in the world\u2019 (Magnello, 2010, p 19). Yet mathematics was not Nightingale\u2019s only passion: she believed that nursing, the vocation for which she is now best known, was her calling from God. For Nightingale, mathematics and nursing were not mutually exclusive. Rather, the two complemented each other; even as a student she undertook private statistical studies of public health, amassing a personal dossier of data (Magnello, 2010, p 20). Nightingale was working as Superintendent of the Hospital for Invalid Gentlewomen in Harley Street when the war began. She had plans to leave the hospital and establish a school for nurses, but all such ambitions were delayed when she was called upon to offer her services in the Crimea (Goldie, 1997, p 1). Nightingale was closely acquainted with numerous politicians, including Sidney Herbert, the Secretary of War at the outbreak of the Crimean conflict (Magnello, 2010, pp 18, 22). Keenly aware of deficiencies in the army\u2019s medical care, Herbert asked Nightingale to be \u2018Superintendent of the female nursing establishment in the English General Military Hospitals in Turkey\u2019 (Matthew, 2009 [2004]). Nightingale agreed and was sent to the Crimea with 38 female nurses in October 1854 (Magnello, 2010, pp 18, 20).\nConditions in the Crimea were dire. Infectious disease was rife: soldiers were dying in their thousands of illnesses including typhus, typhoid, cholera and dysentery (Lambert, 2011 [1990], p 143). Shortly after her arrival, Nightingale wrote to her friend Dr William Bowman, describing the horrors she was facing:\nBut oh! you gentlemen of England, who sit at home in all the well-earned satisfaction of your successful cases, can have little idea from reading the newspapers, of the horror &amp; misery (in a military Hospl.) of operating upon these dying and exhausted men [\u2026] I have no doubt that Providence is quite right and that the Kingdom of Hell is the best beginning for the Kingdom of Heaven, but that this is the Kingdom of Hell no one can doubt (Nightingale, 1997 [14 November 1854], p 36).\nNightingale endeavoured to reduce infection and improve efficiency, but her resources were severely limited (Magnello, 2010, p 23). In letters to Herbert, she bemoans the inexperience of her staff and calls for greater resources, requesting the most basic of supplies: plates and dishes, knives and forks, socks, matting, disinfectant, mops, towels, and scissors (Nightingale, 1997 [21 December 1854], p 52; Nightingale, 1997 [25 December 1854], p 59). Openly critical, Nightingale chastises Herbert for sending her so ill-equipped: \u2018You have sacrificed the cause, so near my heart. You have sacrificed me, a matter of small importance now\u2019 (Nightingale, 1997 [15 December 1854], p 51).\nCriticism of the government\u2019s management of the conflict grew and, in January 1855, the House of Commons passed a motion for a committee of inquiry into the state of the army (Matthew, 2009 [2004]). In February 1855, a Sanitary Commission was appointed to investigate and correct conditions in the Crimea. Led by Dr John Sutherland and Robert Rawlinson, the Commission radically improved sanitation in the hospitals (McDonald, 2010, pp 5, 24). The subsequent dip in instances of infectious disease is largely attributed to these improvements. It was this \u2013 the prevention and limitation of infectious disease \u2013 which became the focus of Nightingale\u2019s campaigns after the war."},

However, Georgano\u2019s focus is on motorcar body building, thus the work neglects the rest of the coachbuilding industry, which included wagonbuilders, cartbuilders, wheelwrights and carriage component manufacturers. It therefore fails to provide an overall perspective on the impact of the automobile industry on coachbuilding, because its focus is on the private vehicle and not on public vehicles such as buses, taxi cabs, or commercial vehicles such as lorries. Because there is no authoritative work on the UK\u2019s carriage industry it is necessary to explore some national trends during the period of transition.Diffusion of the motorised vehicle varied between private, public and commercial vehicles. This difference is noted by Barker and Gerhold (1993, pp 56\u201361), who argue that private and public motoring rapidly replaced horse-drawn vehicles, whilst commercial motor vehicles were much slower to diffuse. However, this conclusion is reached by comparing motor vehicle statistics and generally lacks a comparison with horse-drawn vehicle statistics.[3] Mom (2015, p 65), in an analysis of transport usage in France between 1863\u20131921, presents a much more balanced picture, taking into account both horse-drawn and motorised transport use, which shows that whilst private horse-drawn travel was on a steady decline it still accounted for more overall passenger kilometres than both bicycles and motor vehicles, even after the First World War. The speed with which coachbuilders adapted to the rise of the automobile also depended both on the location (urban or rural) and the type of coachbuilder \u2013 high-class carriagebuilder or wagonbuilder (Tjong Tjin Tai, 2015, p 191; Kinney, 2004, p 298). The variety of the coachbuilding trade is important as the arrival of motorised vehicles affected different areas of the horse trade in radically different ways. For example, high quality carriagebuilders like Cockshoot\u2019s noticed that their upper-class customers were buying automobiles as early as 1902, while wagonbuilders would probably have seen little difference in trade until well after the first decade of the twentieth century, and motorised commercial vehicle sales were very modest before the First World War, especially when compared to passenger vehicles (Barker and Gerhold, 1993, p 60). Diffusion of the automobile started slowly, but rapidly increased into the 1920s. One would expect this to be mirrored by the decline in horse-drawn transport; however, there were subtle but significant variations. Changes can be tracked in the analysis of occupational data from the censuses of England and Wales in 1901, 1911 and 1921. In 1901, there were only 623 people employed as either chauffeurs, commercial drivers, or motorised cab drivers; this had increased to 43,094 by 1911 (Anonymous, 1917). Despite this rise there was an increase in the level of horse-drawn transport employment, from 347,655 in 1901 to 374,587 by 1911.[4] Motorised employment represented only about ten per cent of road transport employment in 1911, a relatively modest amount. If we explore these statistics further we can see some other interesting trends. While the number of chauffeurs grew to 23,151 in 1911, the number of coachmen and grooms employed only fell by 8,127 (to 67,228), suggesting that new automobile owners were not necessarily replacing their coach staff when hiring chauffeurs.[5] Numbers involved in horse-drawn commercial haulage had increased. This is mirrored by the coinciding increase in the number of horses being used for freight purposes (Barker and Gerhold, 1993, p 60). There was a marked decline in public horse-drawn transport, as cabmen, grooms and stablemen numbers declined by a third by 1911.[6] However, this decline was also affected by improved electric tram systems in the cities (Lyddon, 1987, p 180; Barker and Gerhold, 1993, p 54). Statistical analysis is not as detailed for 1921, but by this point the ratio of horse-drivers to motor-drivers in the road transport industry was virtually 50:50. However, the census report noted that this ratio varied significantly by area. For example, while the South had many counties with a majority of motor employment, the North only had one (Anonymous, 1927). \u00a0Business listings in local trade directories allows for an analysis of the regional motor and carriage trade in the first few decades of the twentieth century. Figure 1 shows relatively little difference between 1901 and 1911, notable only for a small number of motorcar garages and agencies emerging, with only a small drop in associated horse and carriage trade businesses; however, between 1911 and 1931 there is an appreciable difference, especially in the rise of motorcar garages and the decline in wheelwrights. However, the number of carriage and coachbuilders stayed roughly the same throughout the period as they often became carriage and motor body builders, showing that coachbuilders were able to adapt and survive in the motor age. Many, like Cockshoot, became motor body builders, agents and garage proprietors.\nThis statistical analysis has been brief, but serves to demonstrate changes over three decades, from a gradual increase in motor transport before the First World War to an ever quicker increase afterwards. This eventually saw the decline of horse-drawn transport in all areas in the inter-war period, although the increase of motorised transport employment did not see a mirrored decrease in horse-drawn. This analysis has also demonstrated the varied speed of diffusion of private, public and commercial vehicles, which would have affected different coachbuilders in different ways."},

Yet this partnership lasted for a relatively short period of time, from 1837 to 1840. In 1840, the year of their latest joint patent, a bitter dispute erupted between the two men. The dispute was as much about intellectual property rights as reputation and social standing. Despite an attempt to resolve the issue through arbitration in 1841, the conflict persisted and soured their relationship, even though they remained in contact out of business necessity, if not friendship, until Wheatstone\u2019s death in 1875. On the face of it, Cooke came out of the arbitration proceedings in a strong position, but it would be an over-simplification to assume Wheatstone was defeated, because he subsequently managed to secure a significant financial reward in return for relinquishing his rights to their joint patent of 1840.[3] This latest agreement, in 1845, allowed Cooke to create the Electric Telegraph Company with the support of two entrepreneurs, John Lewis Ricardo, MP for Stoke and nephew of the economist David Ricardo, and George Parker Bidder, a prominent railway engineer and an associate of Robert Stephenson, the son of George Stephenson who had built the Stockton &amp; Darlington Railway.[4]From the start of their relationship, Cooke and Wheatstone had demonstrated two very different yet complementary approaches to telegraphy. Initially, Cooke envisioned the telegraph to be a signalling device to improve the safety of train operation \u2013 a business opportunity in the fast-growing railway industry.[5] The needle instrument was well adapted for this purpose as it was cheaper to manufacture and easy to operate as a signalling device. As far as Cooke was concerned, there was no need for the sophistication of the dial instrument. Wheatstone, on the other hand, saw in electric telegraphy a means of interpersonal communication \u2013 a vision which assumed that the instruments were domesticated and could be operated by any literate person. After gaining full control of the joint patent in 1845, Cooke ignored the dial instrument which represented Wheatstone\u2019s vision of telegraphy and for the next twelve years, as we shall see below, the needle instrument became the mainstream technology for British telegraphy. Before exploring in more detail this conflict and its aftermath, however, a short history of the technology described in the joint patent of 1840 is needed to understand the context in which these events were taking place, starting in the early days of 1837."},

In the years that followed, the Museum acquired apparatus from several pioneering acoustic experiments including Helmholtz\u2019s complete apparatus for the synthesis of sound, made by Rudolph Koenig; Bosanquet\u2019s harmonium for musical experiments with pure scale; and a large set of tuning forks also made by Koenig in 1885.[2] Notable too was the acquisition of Thomas Edison\u2019s original tinfoil phonograph, the first mechanical machine to both record and reproduce sound.[3] Certainly these were star objects, though the collection was, according to the Bell Report of 1911 on the future of the Science Museum, incomplete, disordered and \u2018hopelessly overcrowded\u2019 in its display (Follett, 1978, p 24).[4]\nThe Bell Report made several recommendations for the modernisation of the Science Museum, including new buildings and new strategies for the acquisition, categorisation and display of collections. Administrative problems and a World War stymied the new building work and it was not until 1925 that the acoustics collection was relocated to the Museum\u2019s new East Block. Keeper of Physics, Ernest Lancaster-Jones, interpreted this deferral in modernisation not as a hindrance, however, but as an opportunity for reviewing the acoustics collection and for thinking carefully about a rationale for its future development. In 1923, Lancaster-Jones completed a new scheme for the expansion of the collection. The scheme subdivided the collection into five discrete sections corresponding to the production, control, recording and measurement of sound, and to the application of acoustics in science, technology and industry. An additional section, called the \u2018Index Collection\u2019 included diagrams, photographs, models and a large written label, and highlighted important stages in the development of these various branches of acoustics.[5] This new taxonomy transformed the acoustics collection both physically and discursively, embodying the approaches to museum display set out by the Bell Report and later standardised by Sir Henry Lyons, Science Museum Director from 1920 to 1933. The categorisation of objects also meant that critical questions were now being asked in order to define disciplinary boundaries, to develop a rationale for the acquisition of new objects and, importantly, to assess strategies for displaying the collection to the public. In the months leading up to the official opening of the Science Museum\u2019s East Block in March 1928, Lancaster-Jones worked closely with industry in order to bring the Sound Receivers, Recorders and Reproducers section up-to-date. The Gramophone Company \u2013 then market leaders in Britain in the development of the gramophone \u2013 made a substantial contribution in the form of several object loans. Combined with existing Science Museum acquisitions, the objects were abundant enough to chart the principle developments in phonograph and gramophone technology from the 1870s to the present.[6] [7] Historical objects from the Gramophone Company\u2019s museum in Hayes included Stoh\u2019s experimental sound reproducer made in 1878; a set of early Edison sound boxes; and a gramophone with an inverted horn made in 1910. Two instruments, both produced by the Gramophone Company, represented the pinnacle of modern gramophone technology: the first an automatic 20-deck gramophone, the second a state-of-the-art electric gramophone.[8] Following the advice from the Bell Report, which had advocated the instructive possibilities for public demonstrations of the Museum\u2019s objects, Lancaster-Jones recommended that these two \u2018striking developments\u2019 be made audible to visitors (Follett, 1978).[9]For Lancaster-Jones, the instructive potential of the demonstration of the electric gramophone lay in its ability to showcase the effects of technology upon sound propagation and sonic particularity, attributes that, he felt, language could not adequately capture alone. Referencing an existing demonstration in which the same music record was played consecutively on a pre-war, a post-war and an electrical instrument, he wrote that acoustic display \u2018does more to express the great development in the technique of reproduction than any amount of verbal explanation\u2019.[10] Through attentive listening, an appreciation of the technical attributes of modern gramophone technology would necessarily follow. Furthermore, as the reference to the existing demonstration illustrates, the electric gramophone offered an auditory equivalent to the taxonomic approach to museum display, which encouraged appreciation of technological development through direct comparison. The demonstration showcased the height of sound reproduction technology against which reproduced sounds encountered outside the museum might be measured."},

The histories of tacit skills and knowledge that were entailed in the use of objects from our collections during their \u2018working lives\u2019 is one such topic. The conference provided a first opportunity to \u2018go public\u2019 with some conversations between the participants that have been underway for the last few years. In these enthusiastic encounters, the potential of re-enactment, reconstruction, replication, restoration of behaviour and object-guided oral history to enrich understanding of practice and objects has become clear.We are optimistic that it will soon be possible to commence funded research projects in this area, but we are also sufficiently convinced of the virtue of combining insights from the differing traditions of practical investigative technique represented here to feel that it is worth publishing the authors\u2019 contributions at this stage. Klaus Staubermann, a curator, starts our selection with insights from practice at National Museums Scotland, as he argues for going beyond the study of two-dimensional evidence \u00ac\u2013 including photographs \u2013 to the replication of artefact experiences. Peter Heering illustrates the kinds of insights that can be gained from operating late eighteenth-century and early nineteenth-century physics apparatus, in this case, solar microscopes. Roger Kneebone, in a summary of his work in simulation-based surgical replication, demonstrates how practical research techniques can yield a panoply of unexpected insights. Yves Winkin concludes our selection with a helpful battery of theoretical resources for thinking about the performances and gestures that constitute the basic \u2018language\u2019 of the operation of machines, instruments and equipment. These sections may well seem disparate, but that is the point. Our shared intuition is that, although practical investigative techniques have been in widespread use, they have ploughed rather separate furrows, and so there is much to learn from bringing these techniques into dialogue with each other, for the sake of gaining deeper understanding of past practices and, in the museum context, of illuminating the histories of the objects we curate. Certainly, on the day of the conference, there was considerable shared excitement about the potential for shared investigations. We are here concerned with two intimately related concepts: histories of use of objects (which is becoming a significant interest for museum curators) and tacit skills (those unspoken, unrecorded, aspects of practice that have been the concern of philosophers, sociologists and others beyond the museum world). We propose that these two aspects are, in fact, two sides of the same coin: histories of use will benefit from being understood in the light of a wide range of intellectual traditions, whilst the study of tacit skills will benefit from its re-association with the material world of objects. There is another binary distinction that lies at the heart of our shared areas of interest, and the division lies at the horizon of human memory, as Roger Kneebone concurs in his section. Several of the techniques of practical investigation of the past rely on recall, whether that is verbal or \u2018muscle memory\u2019. But for earlier periods as represented by Peter Heering\u2019s contribution, or Kneebone\u2019s time-travelling operating theatre, past practice must be painstakingly recreated by close study of a wide range of sources. Here, the museum object itself \u2013 as we can see with the example of the solar microscope \u2013 may be the most eloquent of witnesses. But the insight gained is radically different from that provided by the object-guided oral history of, for example, an anaesthetist reunited with a \u2018Boyle Machine\u2019 anaesthetic ventilator as used earlier in his career. In the first case, there is witness to an experience enjoyed by our antecedents; in the other, there is the potential of disinterring buried recollection. But distinctions invite comparison and dialogue, and that is the aim of the work we have in prospect."},

This retrospective provides a long-term assessment of past accessions and disposals from the point of view of the present. It serves to increase our understanding of the history of the collection and provides a new tool which may serve to inform current collections activities both in our Museum and more widely. Specifically, it elucidates trends in the proportion of material collected at a given time which remains in the collections and that which is currently, or recently, on display. Neither collecting nor disposing of objects are new phenomena in collections development, and neither is carrying out a combination of opportunistic and focused collecting. Collections are, and have been, developed through a mixture of gift and purchase, through reactively accepting offers that are presented to the Museum and actively seeking out desired acquisitions. As well as collecting for present display or research we collect for potential future use (National Museums Scotland, 2017, Collections Development Strategy 2017\u201322) and our success at this will be judged in hindsight, as we now judge the collecting of the past.National Museums Scotland traces its history back to several different organisations: the collections of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland founded in 1780; the Zoological collections from the University of Edinburgh, initially established in 1697 and again in 1812 (though only nineteenth-century material survived to become part of the National Museums Scotland collections); and the Industrial Museum of Scotland, founded in 1854 and soon renamed the Edinburgh Museum of Science and Art before the opening of the first portion of its permanent home on Chambers Street in 1866 and renamed again as the Royal Scottish Museum in 1904 (Swinney, 2013). This range of origins has resulted in the National Museum holding plural collections, as do many other large museums, rather than a single collection. Not only did the different organisations develop their collections in different ways, but different departments within the same organisation, and even individual members of staff have left their mark on the collections (Alberti, 2009, pp 91\u2013122).The focus of this paper is one collection and its historical development, as traced numerically through the Museum\u2019s database; this delimited scope enables the numerical results of specific collections development decisions and actions to be seen more clearly than in a combined analysis of all the Museum\u2019s collections. Specifically, this paper considers material entered into the Technology/Science and Technology register since it was instigated in 1901 and that nineteenth century material which was assigned to the Technology department when the accession numbers were split between \u2018Technology\u2019 and \u2018Art\u2019. There is some fluidity between collection departments, which means that the current boundaries of what are now the Science and Technology department collections are not perfectly aligned with material entered into the Technology registers, but the correlation is over 98 per cent and this initial departmental attribution provides the most complete data for analysis. Since 1976, the aviation collections have been numbered separately, and are not included in this analysis.Museum collections are subjected to a variety of uses; according to the National Heritage Act (Scotland) 1985, objects in the National Museums\u2019 collections are to be \u2018exhibited to and interpreted for the public\u2019 and \u2018available to persons seeking to inspect them in connection with study or research\u2019. In common with many other museums only a small proportion of the objects in the Museum\u2019s collections are on display at any one time. Over time, this proportion has not been drawn equally from across the holdings of the Museum: some treasures are almost certain to feature in the galleries, such as Wylam Dilly (an 1813 locomotive T.2002.38, formerly T.1882.L.1) and the Main Hall clock (T.1921.20, made for its place in the Museum); others have never, yet, been called upon for exhibition and some are acquired and held more for their potential use in research such as multiples and duplicates of very similar objects. Display is, of course, only one of the ways in which museum artefacts are of present value, and current display is only a snapshot of changing permanent and temporary exhibitions. Objects which are accessed for research or publication are of significant use, but these forms of usage of individual objects in this collection have not been recorded in ways amenable to bulk analysis.\nAnalysis of the numbers of acquisitions and growing size of collections has been previously carried out. Bud (2010, p 254) has analysed the current non-Wellcome collections of the Science Museum in London according to their decade of acquisition.\nGosden and Larson (2007) carried out extensive analysis of the acquisitions into the Pitt Rivers Museum using the digitised records to show \u2018patterns in collecting activities\u2019 examining closely both the collectors and categories of the collections. The present study is unique in also including a major contribution from historic collections disposal, and that from a period which predates most of the disposals discussed in current literature and debates (Davies, 2011).This paper questions how past collecting and disposal decisions have affected the current collection and whether the long term history of the collection shows trends which should inform collections development practice in the present. It examines this through bulk query of the entire collections, rather than the object biographies of a small number of items. Are all methods of acquisition equally likely to lead to collections which are used in future? What is the success of reassessing collections and deaccessioning portions?"},

Thornycroft and Company on the River Thames at Chiswick in 1866, though he is recorded as having built steam launches in the same yard as early as 1864. The company later diversified into road vehicles with an extra factory site at Basingstoke where steam, paraffin and, later, petrol lorries were constructed. Perhaps the most famous of these was the \u2018J type\u2019 lorry used extensively during the First World War, both at home and on the western front. In the latter years of the nineteenth century the size of vessels required by the Navy grew to the point at which, if they were launched at Chiswick parts of the superstructure had to be removed in order to allow them to pass under the relatively low bridges on the Thames to sail on trials. Hence in 1904 the Thornycroft Company purchased a ship yard at Woolston, Southampton and its future shipbuilding was largely based here. It is interesting that at this point the testing tank was constructed at the family home rather than the works. It is perhaps indicative of where Thornycroft wanted to work on a day-to day basis, although it could also reflect site restrictions at Woolston; the lack of evidence here means that one can only speculate. To explore the role played by Blanche in the family business we need to understand the context within which ship testing was carried out both within the company and more widely at the time."},

Their images and life stories provide indispensable resources for keen environmental campaign groups and publicists. The expression itself \u2013 charismatic megafauna \u2013 is barely a few decades old. Part of its point is to recall and contrast the hosts of apparently less alluring beings at least as crucial and fragile, possessed of their own cultures and needs, but who instead somehow have to rely for survival and support on the easier appeal of these larger and more compelling beasts. It is tempting to apply the term to less animate, but no less strangely charismatic, articles. In a host of salvage operations and museum collections, objects such as dinosaurs, Pharaonic mummies, totem poles and railway engines all play such roles. The charismatic megafauna of the National Maritime Museum include John Harrison\u2019s astonishing 18th-century sea clocks, now widely reckoned the most important timekeepers ever constructed, not least because of their role in the determination of maritime longitude. Like so many of the artefacts currently held as part of the nation\u2019s heritage, their highly troubled careers embody a remarkable range of themes in craftsmanship and science, conservation and administration, repute and controversy.\nSubject to strenuous and conflicted judgment and trial in the mid 18th century, these clocks went into storage at the Royal Observatory from the 1760s, then spent some time being cleaned at a major London clockmaker\u2019s before eventually returning to Greenwich Observatory in 1840 on the peremptory orders of its head, George Airy. They were but rarely exhibited until salvaged and restored from the 1920s by the naval hydrographer and polymath Rupert Gould (see Figure 2). His work helped them onto the stage: at the Observatory itself, at the British Empire Exhibition of 1925, and, during the 1930s, a period at the Science Museum, before being stashed once again for safety in wartime Cambridge, where they languished in a damp cellar.\u00a0 An important display about Harrison and his chronometers, Four Steps to Longitude, ran at the National Maritime Museum in spring 1962. Their public charisma was massively reinforced by the appearance of Dava Sobel\u2019s Longitude in 1995 and by Charles Sturridge\u2019s Granada film, devoted to the misfortunes both of Harrison and of Gould, released in 2000. The sea clocks and their maker hold pride of place in the Museum\u2019s displays and in well-canvassed stories about navigation and clockwork, and about prejudice and genius.\nAs Ludmilla Jordanova\u2019s discussion of heroism and museology points out in this journal\u2019s first number, storytelling matters a great deal to the life and fate of such charismatic objects and people. This group of mid-18th-century timepieces fit into many different narratives, not all of them mutually compatible. Some tales assume recognisable patterns, such as the comforting plot of lone heroism victimised by hidebound authority and eventually vindicated by posterity. But these need somehow to be combined with distinctly lesser-known narratives of the fascinating and complex milieux in which the machines were designed and built. Their charisma has prompted an apparently obvious question: how could anyone ever doubt these machines would work? But it becomes important to ask how the machines did work, what else worked in the projects to determine longitude at sea, how those functions fitted into the wider craft culture, what environment of competition and evaluation they occupied, and what range of demands and interests in navigation and commerce made such devices valuable. Answers to these queries demand accounts of Hanoverian administration and global trade networks dominated by joint stock companies and the slave trade, of the ingenuities of astronomical and survey instrumentation and the division of labour in computation of mathematical tables, alongside the threats to clocks\u2019 working posed by friction and by temperature change and the equally challenging puzzles of calculating lunar motions years in advance and of performing exquisite angular measurements of celestial positions on a ship at sea.\nIt is not obvious how all these stories can be combined nor made comprehensible to their various audiences. Of course, incomprehension and mystique often nourish charisma\u2019s powers. According to classical sociology, there is a fundamental contrast between charismatic systems that exercise their authority over communities of faithful believers, and bureaucratic systems whose authority relies instead on members\u2019 rule-governed conduct. In museology, as in politics, it seems a commonplace principally to rely on the seductive and credulous appeal of celebrity. But the longitude enterprise simultaneously belongs to narratives of bureaucratic administration and calculated rule as well as to those of ingenious skill and heroic belief: hence the fascinating challenges of designing ways to make sense of that time and make those meanings work in ours.\nExcessive attention to charismatic megafauna can perhaps obscure the fate of the many other agents who matter to an ecosystem. Even the most prodigious rely on and are involved in a lot of others\u2019 different lives. In order to do justice to the range of stories that feature the sea clocks and other devices and personnel that accompany them, it seems vital to increase considerably the cast list of active humans and non-humans that appear in such tales (see Figure 3). Thus when in 2008\u201309 the eminent horologist and National Maritime Museum curator Jonathan Betts was engaged in fixing components of Harrison\u2019s first sea clock, it became apparent that the quality of the brasswork, marks on the dials and the watch chain used all indicated that this 1735 masterpiece depended in part on several other skilled labourers and was the result of coordinated collaboration within a sophisticated nationwide system of divided labour. There is thus a tale to tell that resets the place of this clock and of its making within the intricately managed networks of the Georgian trade.\nThe enlargement of the number of characters in the longitude story was a main aim of a project launched in 2010 with funding from the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) as a partnership between the University of Cambridge and the National Maritime Museum. Team members included the curators Richard Dunn and Rebekah Higgitt, postdoctoral researchers Alexi Baker and Nicky Reeves, and students Katy Barrett, Eoin Phillips and Sophie Waring. Cambridge holds the archives of the Board of Longitude, established in the aftermath of the 1714 Act that offered large public rewards of up to \u00a320,000 for methods for determining longitude at sea, eventually replaced in 1828 by an Admiralty advisory committee. These papers, now gathered in 68 volumes, offer remarkable resources for understanding the ingenious projects and cunning schemes developed in the 18th and early 19th centuries in response to this rather dramatic state initiative in encouragement of technical inquiry and maritime travel. Incoming correspondence documents claimants and technicians, many otherwise obscure or unknown, and thus opens a fascinating window onto the cultures of ingenuity and invention at a period of dramatic economic and social change. The Board would eventually be charged with far more than rewarding longitude schemes, so its archives shed a light on relations between public and private enterprises, on far-flung exploration of the Pacific and the Arctic, and on scientific and imperial policies.\nAlongside the great sea clocks, the Museum holds peerless collections of charts and maritime instruments directly linked with the longitude project. These include series of chronometers whose increased numbers and workability in the late 18th and early 19th centuries eventually helped turn timekeepers into a viable method of determining longitude at sea. There are magnetic compasses and logs that exploit the more traditional and most widely used methods of determining ships\u2019 position by dead reckoning. There are the newfangled sextants designed to allow measures of the position of the Moon, Sun and stars from the moving platform of a ship so as to derive nautical position from celestial angles and times, a technique that long successfully coexisted with the chronometer schemes for maritime longitude.\nImportant, too, are other sets of papers and publications, held both in Cambridge and Greenwich, which include the manuscripts of the Astronomers Royal of the 18th and early 19th centuries and the long runs of almanacs and mariners\u2019 guides, together with an impressive collection of ships\u2019 logs and nautical correspondence. Part of the aim was to link the instrumental hardware of measurement and navigation with the bureaucratic paperwork of claimants and judges, to allow the reconstruction of the system of production, judgment and control that long dominated the longitude projects and their aftermath. This project, in turn, would allow much greater access to these invaluable resources. With support from Jisc, the entire archive was digitised, then made available on an open-access website maintained by Cambridge Digital Library. Guides and commentaries were provided for these documents, and links added to connect references in the Board\u2019s papers and correspondence to the matching instruments and images in the National Maritime Museum\u2019s collections.\nIn museological debates on the show of science and technology it is often held that original objects are insufficiently eloquent and compelling to recruit public interest and understanding. Instead, it is argued, it is necessary to surround these instruments and machines with instructive and interactive installations, or even simply expel such devices from display. In the case of the longitude stories, however, a few charismatic objects can be used to give voice to series of other much less well-known agents. These magnificently compelling objects include some of the most important artefacts that accompanied the British entry into the Pacific in the 18th century. James Cook\u2019s voyages, well documented in the Board of Longitude archives, were charged with trialling the efficacy of a range of longitude methods, both the remarkable copy of Harrison\u2019s sea watch made by Larcum Kendall and taken by Cook into the Pacific, and the sextants and almanacs used to determine the longitude by astronomical methods.\nThe instruments that accompanied Cook, Bligh or Vancouver are compelling enough to motivate important stories about islanders\u2019 agency, while the charts made in Oceania have their own narratives of encounter and travel well beyond European networks. Following the Board\u2019s assumption in 1818 of management of expeditions into the Arctic to define a northwest passage to the Pacific, superbly detailed materials were accumulated on polar science and navigation, with accompanying charts and images of ice fields, auroras and the peoples of the northern seas. The presence of Polynesian and Inuit navigators within these stories of maritime sciences helps show how many were implicated in the global longitude project.\nThese issues of scope and of participation emerge in part from the complex relation between charisma and bureaucracy within the composition of the longitude archives. The first recorded meeting of the Commissioners of Longitude nominated by the 1714 Act took place in 1737, and was immediately prompted by Harrison\u2019s claims for his sea clock. Relations between Harrison and the Board remained warm and supportive until the 1760s. But comparatively little of the Board\u2019s extant records deal with his schemes, which can be better followed in documents such as the papers of the Astronomer Royal Nevil Maskelyne, also available on the Cambridge Digital Library website, including records of the West Indies voyages and the Greenwich trials that tested the sea clocks. Indeed, these records owe their current disposition to the seventh Astronomer Royal, George Airy. In the late 1830s, just as he sought to recover Harrison\u2019s sea clocks, so he sought to accumulate the Board of Longitude\u2019s records from the Royal Society and the Admiralty. Two decades later, Airy had all the papers bound in volumes he described as \u2018one of the most curious collections of scientific enterprise, both normal and abnormal, which exists\u2019. The stern astronomer\u2019s notions of normality have since governed the ways in which institutional memory has worked, carefully discriminating between sea trials and instrument designs, teasing apart the records of clock schemes from those for astronomical methods, setting aside papers concerned with hydrography, magnetism and the tides, and reserving special volumes for what Airy judged \u2018irrational schemes\u2019. It is clear this classification barely did justice to the original scope of inquiry embodied in the Board\u2019s records and associated documents: claimants ranging from religious pamphleteers and shoe manufacturers to East Indian employees and German professors generated a remarkable and richly documented and illustrated stream of projects.\nPart of the aim of the AHRC project has been to use these records to make sense of the inventive cultures of 18th- and early-19th-century society, extending well beyond the narrower confines of the British astronomical and horological communities.\nThis has been achieved both through documentary research and through creative museology. A major exhibition curated by Richard Dunn and Rebekah Higgitt, Ships, clocks and stars, drawing on the project\u2019s work, opened in summer 2014. The National Maritime Museum team, including curators Heloise Finch-Boyer and Richard Dunn, also used the digitised records of the broad range of schemes submitted to the Board as a prompt for steampunk designers and artists who were then invited to display their own versions of such projects within the galleries of the Royal Observatory. In 1824 Samuel Parlour, based at the East India Company\u2019s military college at Addiscombe, submitted a scheme for an apparatus to be worn on a seaborne observer\u2019s shoulders that would allow the telescopic observation of the eclipses of Jupiter\u2019s moons, and thus determine absolute time.\nIt resembled a much earlier scheme proposed by Galileo, but despite undergoing sea trials in the 1820s, was rejected by the Board. Using the specifications preserved in the Board\u2019s archive, the designer Matthew Dockrey manufactured an ingeniously adapted version of Parlour\u2019s apparatus for display alongside a range of such adapted projects in the exhibition Longitude Punk\u2019d that opened at Greenwich in March 2014. No doubt part of the aim of the AHRC-funded project is its artful reclamation of the otherwise lost creativity of hosts of past designers and visionary artists. Part, too, lies in the capacity of these materials to alter the current sense of a monotonic and determined story of technological and social change.\nIt is historians\u2019 sceptical habit to find charisma dubious and to call into question received heroic tales of the sciences\u2019 past: and this can pose major challenges and offer significant opportunities for curatorial work. It is rarely sufficient, however, simply to show how charismatic stories have been tangled up with myths. At least as important, especially in research and in outreach, is to understand and show how these stories work and the functions they so well fulfil. Study of the material records of the longitude project fits the pattern. It seemed valuable to bring out the major challenges of 18th-century navigation as more complex, more conflicted and much less self-evident than received narratives would have them. Correlation of material from the Cambridge Digital Library with other online databases of texts, objects and images provided vital and surprising resources. In the Old Bailey court records for 1692, project member Alexi Baker found evidence of a fight at the Ship Tavern which broke out because a customer claimed \u2018there was no such word as Longitude\u2019: he was killed in the ensuing brawl. \u2018Longitude\u2019 would, however, soon become a common term in satire, science and scandal. Alongside charisma and bureaucracy, the role of tradition and custom needed stressing, since most mariners relied on conventional methods of determining their position, methods that had long served them well. In the absence of any accurate sea charts, furthermore, knowing a ship\u2019s exact location would be more or less useless: so hydrographers and surveyors have to be granted crucial roles in any longitude story.\nNor would a purely chronometric method for longitude at sea ever be entirely straightforward, not least because of the difficulty of ascertaining local time. It has been important to show that both astronomical and horological methods were then viable solutions to the longitude problem, and to work out ways of explaining how they were frequently treated as complementary rather than rival schemes while at sea.\nOn Cook\u2019s expeditions, for example, the navigator would use conventional dead reckoning over periods of a few days\u2019 travel; every few weeks he would take a fix with his sea clock in combination with select astronomical observations and consultation of his Greenwich almanac; and would periodically calculate his position astronomically, from lunar observations, to reset his watch. It is just as telling that the protagonists of the Longitude Acts knew perfectly well what the likely solutions to the problem of navigation at sea would involve. Acting during the preparation of the Longitude Act in 1714 as the rough equivalent of a government scientific adviser, Isaac Newton clearly laid down the viable approaches. It has been alleged that Newton erred in backing astronomical against chronometric schemes for nautical longitude, but he said no such thing, instead correctly arguing that clocks alone could never deliver a longitude solution. It has even been shown by Rebekah Higgitt that there was no such thing as the Longitude Prize in the 18th century and that the phrase was barely ever used in that period. Instead, the Act prescribed rewards, often in compensation for costs incurred by claimants. The cost of rewards, of which Harrison received the largest single share, would eventually make up about one third of the Board\u2019s entire expenditure. Other aspects of its activities, in distributing publications and in sponsoring global expeditions, emphasise the significance of this very early and epochal initiative in the state support of inquiry, innovation and infrastructure.\nThere are many ways in which longitude histories have contemporary resonance, not least in attention to the status of the heroic inventor and the community of innovators and artisans, in the light shed on the constructive role of state action in cultivating economic and technical activity, and in the fascination of loss and location at sea and in space. Collaboration between scholarship and curatorship can help present these themes in original ways and demonstrate how the rich resources of material culture and practice can acquire a vast range of public meanings. In so doing, we are no doubt recapitulating some challenges already faced in early modern Britain. The crux of the longitude programme then was to work out how an apparently incomprehensible and esoteric scheme could possibly be explained to others, and in principle, though barely ever in practice, understood and used everywhere. Charisma had somehow to become routine.\n\u00a0\nFurther readingDunn, R and Higgitt, R, 2014, Finding Longitude (London: Collins) offers an accessible, well-illustrated and reliable introduction to the longitude programme: the book was produced as companion to the National Maritime Museum exhibition Ships, Clocks and Stars (2014\u201315).Betts, J, 2006, Time Restored (Oxford: Oxford University Press) is a fascinating account of Rupert Gould\u2019s career and the recovery and restoration of the Harrison sea clocks.

Born Ramkrishna Lad in 1822, he grew up in Goa with his father, Vithal, and his younger brother, Narayan. Ten years later, Vithal moved his family to Bombay, where Daji\u2019s reputation as a prodigy still endures (Mukhopadhyay, 2018, p 114). According to his biographers, he was an avid chess player by the age of ten and his capacity for brilliant strategic thinking well beyond his years caught the eye of the Governor of Bombay. The Governor was so impressed that he encouraged Daji\u2019s father to give his son the best education possible and the young Daji went on to attend the prestigious Elphinstone College in 1840 (Keer, 1963; Mainkar, Bhandarkar and Dar, 1974; Naik, 1995; Mukhopadhyay, 2018). It was there that he developed an interest in social, educational and political reform \u2013 advocating against female infanticide, supporting the education of women, and campaigning for widow remarriage (Mukhopadhyay, 2018, p 115). Daji was among the first students to train as a physician at the newly established Grant Medical College in Bombay \u2013 one of the first European medical schools founded for the training of Indian practitioners.\nBy the middle of the nineteenth century, European physicians had been practising medicine in India for nearly 300 years. However, these physicians had focused almost exclusively on the treatment of other Europeans, and the care of colonised peoples was mostly left to practitioners of indigenous medical systems. With the increasing formalisation of British control over India, so too did European physicians seek to establish their dominance over medical practice in the Raj. Western-style medical schools like Grant Medical College sought to do away with, in the words of Charles Morehead (1807\u20131882), \u2018the demoralising effects of the irrational, superstitious, and, too often, criminal empiricism\u2019 of native doctors through the education of Indian practitioners (quoted in Pandya, 2004, p 295). Shubada Pandya (2004, p 296) has argued that training at an elite college like Grant helped to establish an influential and powerful new class of Indian private practitioners \u2013 who went on to challenge the supremacy of the British dominated Indian Medical Service. Daji was one of only three Hindu students in the inaugural class, largely due to religious prohibitions around the dissection of human bodies. Nevertheless, Daji excelled at Grant, graduating in 1851 and opening a dispensary with his brother (Ramanna, 2000, pp 51\u201352). In this same period, he also became a respected Sanskrit scholar. He published several articles in Bombay\u2019s Royal Asiatic Society Journal and he was known for his interest in and ability to interpret the ancient Elephanta inscriptions. Daji played a role in the creation of the Victoria and Albert Museum, Bombay (now the Dr. Bhau Daji Lad Museum, Mumbai) and was a founding member of the Photographic Society of Bombay. His brother Narayan was a talented photographer in his own right, with his work being exhibited at early Society meetings (Pinney, 2008, pp 12\u201314).In the late 1850s, Daji became engrossed in researching and finding a cure for leprosy (Boyd, 1893, p 389). Contrary to European theory, Indian physicians believed leprosy to be contagious and curable. As a student of both eastern and western education with an extensive knowledge of Sanskrit texts, Daji was in a unique position to blend both knowledge systems. The Ayurvedic tradition had a well-established set of therapeutic practices for the disease, which had been plaguing the Indian subcontinent for centuries. Daji continued to work throughout the 1860s on his cure by studying the relief-bringing remedies of indigenous communities through a western approach of experimental investigation. Not long after, Indian newspapers began publishing letters from his patients detailing their experiences of his treatment, which caught the attention of the medical press in Britain (Boyd, 1893, p 389). Despite these glowing testimonials, The Lancet (\u2018The cure of leprosy\u2019, 1868, p 238) expressed their scepticism at Daji\u2019s methods, writing:\nThe statements that have now been made as regards better success are necessarily received by us with suspicion. Dr Bhau Daji\u2019s first step should be to make known his remedies and his mode of procedure. Opportunities for putting them to the test will occur in England.\nDaji\u2019s insistence on keeping his remedy secret ruffled feathers both in India and in Britain as it contravened the \u2018rational empiricism\u2019 on which western medical practice prided itself (Pandya, 2004, p 305). Ironically, it was due to this metropolitan scepticism that Daji resolved to keep his remedy a secret until all of his trials and investigations had been thoroughly analysed. As he remarked:\nKnowing the numerous fallacies that are liable to influence inferences drawn from observations imperfect in themselves, or few in number, I am collecting for the Profession...data on a large scale (comprising three or four hundred cases) from which to make deductions with regard to cure, conditions of treatment (quoted in Pandya, 2009, p 98).\nUnfortunately, Daji\u2019s ambitious project was interrupted by his sudden death. What we know today of the Daji method is the result of English surgeon Stanley Boyd\u2019s later research into his work. Boyd discovered that at the time of Daji's death, even Narayan did not know the secret behind the cure. His greatest breakthrough in unravelling the mystery was identifying and interviewing the father of a former patient \u2013 a young male European known as TBH, who had left India after this treatment and was now living in London and working as a carpenter. Given the stigma attached to the disease, the man would not reveal his son\u2019s name and was reticent to share many details. He reported that he had destroyed the photographs of his son with the disease and had managed to keep his former condition a secret even within his family. Reviewing the evidence, Boyd came to the conclusion that the Daji method relied mainly on the topical and internal application of chaulmoogra oil (Hydnocarpus wightianus), along with a strict vegetarian diet, although the complete treatment regimen remained a mystery.\nWhile chaulmoogra oil was not widely used in Europe until the early twentieth century, in India its use to treat leprosy and other dermatological diseases stretches back over two thousand years. The Sushruta Samhita, one of the foundational ancient Sanskrit texts on medicine and surgery, describes both the clinical features and treatment of leprosy around 600 BCE (Dharmendra, 1947, pp 424\u2013430). Employing his extensive knowledge of Indian history and remedies Daji was uniquely placed as an interface between indigenous knowledge of plant medicines and European approaches to disease. Despite Boyd\u2019s efforts, however, Daji\u2019s name failed to be associated with the use of chaulmoogra oil in the treatment of leprosy. Nevertheless, the oil entered into widespread use in colonial medicine in the early twentieth century \u2013 publications such as The Lancet reported on the many cases in which injectable and topical treatments were becoming more and more commonplace (Rogers, 1921). Daji\u2019s remedy continued without him well into the first half of the twentieth century and stood as the preferred method of symptom relief until the 1940s when sulfonyl antibiotics were introduced (Parascandola, 2003, p 48).\u00a0"},

In this case it is being used to power a washing machine, at a glance demonstrating two important factors in the understanding of technology and society. Firstly, it displays the reconfiguration of work-life patterns that such devices catalysed. Secondly, the image presents the personal stories that accompany individual artefacts. How did the family depicted afford this cutting-edge equipment? Was the user really emancipated? This short discussion presents case-studies in the collection of personal stories in technology, as a contextual contribution to the Material Cultures of Energy project \u2013 a four-year AHRC funded project based at Birkbeck, University of London, examining the impact of energy transitions in the past, present and future. We explore three examples of how the collection and interpretation of energy objects has evolved in National Museums Scotland: the \u2018Hired Man\u2019 engine mentioned above, as well as a Parsons turbine and solar-light kit. All three are displayed in Energise, one of ten award-winning galleries that opened in the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh in July 2016.Energise is divided into four sections: sources of energy; using energy; distributing energy; and generating energy. The largest of the 121 objects in the gallery is an isolator from the Portobello substation in Edinburgh, used to shut off the electrical circuit making it safe to repair faults. It was part of the first section of the National Grid to be switched on in 1930. Featured renewable energy technologies include the tip of a 50-metre wind turbine blade used at the Griffin windfarm in Perthshire, the first licensed hydrogen fuel cell car in the UK (Reva hydrogen powered car, by PURE Energy, 2003), and a 4-metre long wave tank created especially for the Museum by wave tank designers Edinburgh Designs Ltd. In the opening \u2018Generating Energy\u2019 section we focus on technologies designed to generate electricity, including an Edison electric light dynamo (1882) displayed alongside a sectioned Parsons turbo-generator manufactured by Clarke, Chapman, Parsons and Co. in 1889.\nWe picked out the \u2018Hired Man\u2019 to open with because it provides a telling example of how museums collected domestic technology in the 1960s and it reflects the curatorial trend of the time which emphasised the story of invention, particularly British invention, rather than personal stories or broader narratives of use. The curatorial file created for this engine at the time of collection tells us how it was then perceived, providing copious details on the technical aspects of the machine but only a short note to indicate that it had been used to power a joiner\u2019s shop in Fife until the mid-1960s. \u2018Until recently this engine was still being used to power tools in a joiner\u2019s shop\u2019, a rare note on usage revealed, \u2018and it was seen running by Mr R W Plenderleith [Robert Plenderleith, Keeper of Technology 1966] during the summer of 1966 before being purchased by the Museum.\u2019\nBy contrast, what links the objects in Energise and other displays throughout the new science and technology suite is the objective to exhibit human stories of everyday life in varying global contexts alongside scientific concepts and technological developments. It was therefore important to draw out the human elements of the story of the \u2018Hired Man\u2019, and more generally to showcase objects that can tell engaging stories about the experience of users and developers and the social impact of those technologies. As a contribution to Material Cultures of Energy, in the rest of this short discussion paper we will present two other domestic-energy objects in Energise: a solar-light kit and a hydro turbine. Like the \u2018Hired Man\u2019, they are deceptively humble but nevertheless demonstrate important changes in both everyday usage and museum collecting practices. Domestic energy technology forms a significant part of the exhibition which aims to make our visitors more aware of their own energy usage at home, work or school. Although from different continents and dating almost a century apart, the solar-light kit and the turbine are connected; both provided innovative off-grid solutions to the problem of gaining easy and reliable access to, and employment of, electricity. On display in Energise, we relate this to more local Scottish stories \u2013 the Isle of Eigg (Scottish Inner Hebrides) has a micro-grid powered by three generators in combination with solar and wind energy. Nevertheless, their cultural and social contexts of use contrast sharply. The solar-light kit was employed in regions of extreme poverty in Bangladesh, and the hydro-turbine was used to power a grand Scottish country estate. In each case we explore how and why these objects and the stories associated were collected and what themes they were intended to display. What lessons can be learned from the experience of displaying them? Can we humanise technology?\nIt was a priority that Energise conveyed that not everyone in the world has easy and reliable access to electricity. Developed in Bangladesh in 1996, the Grameen Shakti solar energy scheme provides small loans to householders in remote and rural areas to enable them to replace kerosene-fuelled lighting with solar panels. The scheme facilitated the installation of more than two million solar home systems, thus saving fuel and reducing dangerous fumes and fire risks. Grameen Shakti made initial contact with National Museums Scotland, following a previous collaboration that involved collecting mobile telephones. Developed by the German social company Villageboom in M\u00fcnster, the light kit is made up of a small solar panel and a lamp/charger. This relatively simple technology is changing work patterns, improving business prospects and enhancing health and safety in off-grid areas. This then drew our attention to their work on solar panels and led us to examine the case-studies provided by Grameen Shakti. Living forty kilometres from Dhaka, solar kit user Rasheda Begum explained that she no longer needs to waste time cleaning kerosene lamps, there is now no problem of smoke in the room, and her daughter can now study in the evenings \u2013 something which proved hard under the kerosene lamp-light. They also used the solar unit to power a television and a fan and consequently feel that the unit has vastly improved their quality of life. Others reported the benefits of having LED lights as a security deterrent in their cattle and chicken sheds adjacent to their houses. Grocer Nural Islam described how his shop has benefitted greatly from solar power. He now has a television in his shop which shows daily dramas; locals crowd in to view and his sales have increased considerably. He can also extend opening hours, again increasing profits. On gallery we seek to tell how this solar kit transforms lives. Grameen Shakti\u2019s system is not necessarily unique. There are similar systems in other countries, such as the \u2018Scotland lights up Malawi\u2019 project. But Grameen Shakti is home grown, made by and for the people of Bangladesh with the objective of alleviating extreme poverty through micro-credit. Engineers are trained to be \u2018social engineers\u2019 who go from place to place demonstrating the technology and training local young people to be technicians so that all the after-sales support customers require is close at hand. These solar panels are an example of collecting not only the company\u2019s story and rationale, but also capturing personal stories and local usage, giving a sense of how technology transforms day-to-day lives. This marks a significant shift in focus from capturing the story of invention as exemplified by the \u2018Hired Man\u2019. It was important for us that our interpretation captures these stories. \u2018Hired Man\u2019 has been made a working interactive. Users push a button and see it in action, so rather than providing facts and figures we emphasise the impact of such engines, which saved labour. The solar-kit\u2019s label shows a photograph of users in Bangladesh, although does not refer to named users. This is how we can present the personal and present human engagement with technologies which at first glance may seem impersonal or mundane.\nThe final object in our trilogy of personal stories is a small Gilkes Pelton wheel hydroelectric turbine, one of a pair installed in Noddsdale Estate near Largs (Ayrshire) in 1927. The system was used to light the main house and four ancillary cottages. The owners described how they would turn it on to provide the power to listen to the radio or to vacuum. The turbines were in use for almost eighty years \u2013 this is also a story of the longevity of a particular type of technology. \u2018It belongs to an age when things were made to last,\u2019 reflected its final user, Peter Robertson (who was five years old when the turbines were installed), \u2018in strict contrast to so much that is made today, which is designed to have a short life.\u2019 On gallery the interpretation panel shows a photograph of Robertson with the turbine, with the interpretation focusing on the social context of use \u2013 highlighting where it was used and how it could affect the lives of those around it. The turbine was still working in 2007 when the electrical system had to be modernised and the house was converted to mains electricity. Peter told us in 2015:\nThe old machinery was running sweetly up until its last day of operation. It was replaced, because the house had to be rewired for 240V AC against the 110V DC of the 1920s and modern machinery could make better use of the natural resources available. The old machines had a maximum output of some 6.5 kW, whereas the replacement is designed to produce 50 kW.\nA new hydroelectric system has since been installed on the estate to provide power both for their use and to sell back to the grid. In the process of collecting we were privileged to be able to engage with Peter and his family. We visited the site (including the new powerhouse which was built in 2007 as a replacement for the old turbine), listened to him recall personal memories about life and work at the house, and enjoyed meeting with the family and a tour of the estate. He speaks fondly of using and maintaining the turbine, which formed part of his family\u2019s daily life for almost eighty years. He was delighted to have the opportunity to see it on display in the Museum (Figure 6) and noted how pleased he was to see that we hadn\u2019t \u2018tarted it up\u2019: it still looked how he remembered it in use. This unassuming artefact may be overshadowed by some of the more eye-catching displays but it offered a remarkable opportunity to acquire a display-sized turbine, thereby emphasising the importance of this technology, while also collecting the user-story of the habits and daily routines surrounding the object. Inherent in the history of this turbine are the practices developed by the owners to use the resource effectively and also practices imposed on them by the technology itself, determining when and how it could be used. The same technology is employed in hydroelectric power stations, but at a scale that would be too vast to collect or display in most cases. In conclusion, by collecting the specific stories surrounding everyday artefacts Energise seeks to demonstrate the reconfiguration of work-life patterns across the twentieth century, and across continents. But these examples also remind us of the limitations of what our new galleries can achieve. Summative evaluation revealed that only a small proportion of visitors\u2019 dwell-time in this gallery was devoted to these displays; the interactives, such as the \u2018Energy Wheel\u2019 that dominates the space, are much more popular. Also, a story panel or object-text with its limited word count can only convey a fraction of the life on an object and its maker or user. Within the expected spatial and thematic constraints of label writing, we were unable to detail specific personal stories such as Rasheda Begum and Nural Islam\u2019s. Yet they are recorded in our collection and remain available to researchers or for incorporation into future displays. This is why we need to continue to capture the knowledge of the people involved and their personal stories. This approach ranges from broad oral histories to more focused projects such as our 2017 exhibition Age of Oil, which explored the decommissioning of oil platforms through the personal experiences of artist Sue Jane Taylor. Museums deal in materiality through the artefacts they collect, store, interpret and display. The associated stories of human experience tell us a great deal about how we used energy in the past, how that is changing, and why the domestic context is important. The depth of the energy collections at National Museums Scotland also allow us to consider energy transitions over time, from historic dynamos and coal samples, to the National Grid, to energy-saving devices. It would be profitable to explore the role of artefacts and museums further in the context of comparative projects like Material Cultures of Energy. How can we better capture and display these material concepts? How do we continue to capture and reflect user practice today? How do we remain relevant to our audiences? Are we successful in engaging visitors with the changing sources and use of energy over time, and do they actually reflect on their own energy use as a result?"},

In the 19th century they were referred to as \u2018Bally\u2019s phrenological specimens\u2019, a tool used by William Bally in his practice of phrenology. Said to be made in Manchester in 1831, the set was collected by the Wellcome Historical Medical Museum in 1951, and put on display at the Science Museum in the late 1970s. Then, when the set was requested for loan to the Wellcome Collection exhibition Brains: The Mind as Matter at the Museum of Science &amp; Industry in Manchester, it seemed exciting to think that it was coming home after almost 200 years away. But research has uncovered that this neat story of origin and return is very possibly untrue. The signs were there \u2013 the object has always been catalogued as \u2018possibly Manchester or Dublin\u2019. When initial research revealed that the maker, William Bally, was in Manchester during the 1830s, the \u2018coming home\u2019 story gained momentum.\nUsing close inspection of the object, and a re-examination of the primary literature surrounding William Bally and his phrenological practice, it has been possible to determine that the set was in fact made in 1832, and that Bally\u2019s career as a phrenologist probably began with this set of miniature busts. Historian Roger Cooter has cited the busts in his comprehensive Phrenology in the British Isles (Cooter, 1989, p 313), but this is the first time that the context of their production has been considered, both in terms of the importance to Bally\u2019s career as a phrenologist, and the importance of material culture to the practice of phrenology in the 19th century. Nevertheless, whether the set of miniature busts was made in Manchester or Dublin remains a matter of speculation."},

A major inspiration was the active decision to collect artefacts such as the posters and banners, art and ephemera of the Black Lives Matter movement in the US by the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which led to the nationwide collection of protest material that continues today. The New York Historical Society\u2019s \u2018History Responds\u2019 collecting programme, begun in response to the 11 September 2001 attack on the World Trade Center, also documents protests through the wealth of material it collects at source by its curators. The People\u2019s History Museum in Manchester, UK, also provided a model for collecting. Since the beginning of collecting at the NMI, museum practitioners across the world have dedicated themselves to collecting material representing issues such as climate change and the Covid-19 pandemic. Knowledge of these museums\u2019 work and their experience of collecting protest objects naturally influenced the thinking around the formulation of a plan to collect Repeal the 8th in Ireland, especially regarding public involvement in sourcing artefacts, and in acknowledging that protest objects across the world have many similarities.The first step in the collection plan for Repeal the 8th was the creation of a schema \u2013 a decision-making framework which was formulated during the months of the debate before the referendum date by examining the various topics and concerns being discussed in the public arena, and familiarising myself with the material being produced as a result. This involved analysing the key messages of the Yes and No campaigns, looking at polling data illustrating the expected gender, generation and rural/urban opinion divides, the artist community response, grassroots organisations and diaspora protest action. This created a guideline from which to identify groups to approach to engage with the collecting project."},

The Science Museum had done nothing so ambitious since the War and we might think that Gilbert was displaying the na\u00efve enthusiasm of a newcomer. Even so, O\u2019Dea lost no time in asking the Director, Herman Shaw, for permission to go ahead with the single model Gilbert had proposed for his own area of textile mechanics, to be made in the Museum\u2019s workshops. This was Leonardo\u2019s spinning machine, which, as it happens, was never made. Furthermore, O\u2019Dea liked the idea of a more ambitious exhibition and thought it should be discussed among the other relevant Keepers.\nThe Director considered that, rather than commissioning a single model, the possibility of a \u2018Special Exhibition\u2019, a term he placed in inverted commas because it was clearly not an everyday one, should be explored. Accordingly, by 8 September Gilbert had prepared an extensive proposal, now typewritten, where he outlined Leonardo\u2019s achievements in applied mechanics, compiled a short bibliography and a list of manuscripts in Britain, and described the \u2018splendid exhibition in Milan in 1939\u2019. This, he reported, had included about 120 models and he attached copies of the exhibition guide and the catalogue. Gilbert made the point that the exact date of Leonardo\u2019s birth, 15 April 1452, had been settled only in 1939. This would be the first time a Leonardo anniversary could be celebrated with confidence.[7]\nThe very large Leonardo exhibition at the Palazzo dell\u2019Arte in Milan in 1939 contained two hundred models based on Leonardo\u2019s drawings. The models had been made at the request of Benito Mussolini. The Milan models became known in Britain through pictures in The Illustrated London News (Illustrated London News, 1939). The Liberal peer Herbert Samuel suggested to Ernest Mackintosh, then Director of the Science Museum, that the exhibition might come to London, but that was considered impossibly expensive.[8] The models were displayed in New York in 1940 but in 1942 were lost at sea, it would seem following their exhibition in Japan and, although the record is sketchy, as a result of a wartime engagement (Landrus, 2013, pp 323\u20135). Another famous early set was commissioned by the Los Angeles Country Museum from the Italian engineer, Roberto Guatelli, who became a specialist in Leonardo models. It was displayed in Los Angeles in 1949, then went on tour and was purchased in 1951 by IBM, who commissioned further models from Guatelli and organised travelling exhibitions (Landrus, 2013, pp 323\u20135; Moon, 2007, pp 200\u201303).\nAs O\u2019Dea passed Gilbert\u2019s paper on to the Director, it was clear that his enthusiasm for the exhibition project had increased, though he recognised that Leonardo\u2019s ideas had not been directly influential and he speculated on why this might have been: \u2018Unlike Galileo, Leonardo seems not to have been particularly aggressive in the face of prejudice against the developments he probably regarded as sound but dangerous to his safety if he pushed them too diligently\u2019.[9] What O\u2019Dea can have imagined was dangerous about Leonardo\u2019s mechanical ideas, his consideration of fossils notwithstanding, is far from clear, but the remark reflects the prevailing emphasis at the Museum on what were seen as progressive contributions to the making of modern science. A genius he may have been, but had Leonardo played an effective part in that history?\nWhat emerged from O\u2019Dea\u2019s discussion with the Director was nothing more decisive than an instruction to Gilbert to circulate the proposal around senior officers in other departments. For the most part they were not enthusiastic \u2013 John Chaldecott, Arthur Stowers, William Church, Fredrick Skinner and Henry Calvert demurred in turn for one reason or another: display space was limited; workshop staff were occupied; Leonardo was irrelevant to the development of science; and so on.A completely different tone was struck by Frank Greenaway,[10] who in a firm hand dashed off the retort that his colleagues had \u2018missed an essential point\u2019: Leonardo, as he put it, would be \u2018News\u2019 in 1952. Here was an opportunity that others would be keen to grasp:\nThe artistic and literary worlds will make much of him\u2026to look beyond the limits of the object in hand, they will use the study of Leonardo\u2019s own achievement to illustrate wider aspects of the period and general truths of historical development. \u2026 If, of the other hand, the imagination of the Museum is limited to the practicability of moving object X from case Y to case Z we had better keep out of the arena.[11]\nWith that challenge on the file, F A B Ward and Philip Sumner in their turn could hardly do other than give Gilbert some qualified support. Greenaway had tried to change the historical agenda. The other keepers saw the Museum\u2019s mission as presenting the development and the content of science today; whatever his individual accomplishments, if Leonardo had not contributed to that historical progression, he was scarcely relevant. Greenaway, on the other hand, took a more historical view. Leonardo\u2019s place in the Renaissance was of interest in itself and did not depend on present-day science, while his anniversary was a signal opportunity for cultural impact. His suggestion was for an exhibition on \u2018Leonardo and the Science of his Times\u2019.Gilbert tried again in October 1950. He had a new Keeper in Arthur Stowers and a new Director in Frank Sherwood Taylor. His prospects must have looked brighter: Sherwood Taylor was a historian and intellectual, with a mission to humanise the sciences after two world wars had made the dangers of a narrow, technical, unthinking, dehumanised focus on science all too evident (Simcock, 1987; Greenaway, 2004). Leonardo might well be an attractive subject, bridging the humanities and the sciences. In the previous round Stowers had judged that Leonardo had had \u2018no influence on the development of Motive Power\u2019 and, more tellingly, had raised a doubt about the value and legitimacy of making models from his drawings: \u2018I am doubtful whether many of Leonardo\u2019s devices were actually used in practice, and many sketches are not sufficiently clear to make models from them.\u2019 Nonetheless, Gilbert began to revive his scheme by preparing for Stowers an accurate summary of the file so far, which he is unlikely to have done without being asked.\nGilbert admits that, having consulted eleven officers responsible for collections in subjects of interest to Leonardo, \u2018In many cases the response was not enthusiastic because L da V\u2019s stature as a scientist and inventor has only been appreciated in modern times and it cannot be shown that his ideas had much influence on the development of science and technology\u2019.[12] So, Greenaway\u2019s alternative historiography had not prevailed. Gilbert goes on to subsume Stowers\u2019s doubt about the legitimacy of making models into the same question: \u2018Consequently it is thought that the effort involved in constructing models of machines, which have never in fact existed outside L da V\u2019s M.S.S., would be better employed in some other development of the collections.\u2019 In other words, if no machines had been made, if they had got no further than drawings in private manuscripts, what justification was there for committing Science Museum resources to their explication through the making of models? We might assume this was not Gilbert\u2019s attitude, but it was a fair summary of the consensus among his colleagues. At least Donovan Chilton had offered a stratagem to cover one of the dangers of making models. He thought that full-size constructions, such as those in the Italian exhibition, might give visitors the wrong impression that the machines had in fact been made in Leonardo\u2019s time and here were reproductions of them. Any models constructed should be small, \u2018so that it is clear that they are only realisations of the notebook sketches\u2019. This would also help with the other issue raised by Stowers, since \u2018small scale models would also avoid the difficulty of representing detail which is conjectural\u2019.\nGilbert found himself facing the possibility of, at best, rather a small exhibition, which he thought would be inappropriate to the range of Leonardo\u2019s work and to the whole idea of celebrating the anniversary in the first place. It was clear that the departments were not going to divert sufficient resources to realise an exhibition to match the occasion. His rather surprising answer was to propose a much larger exhibition, hosted at the Science Museum but organised in collaboration with other bodies: his shrinking project would re-emerge as a contribution to something much more ambitious. The first step would be to approach other institutions, with a view to setting up \u2018a representative committee to organise the exhibition\u2019.Stowers passed this suggestion to Sherwood Taylor, with Gilbert\u2019s list of possible collaborators, explaining the muted interest in a quincentenary exhibition from Leonardo\u2019s marginal influence on the physical sciences and adding the telling remark that he did not appear in the index of \u2018your book\u2019, The World of Science. The absence of empathy between Sherwood Taylor and his senior curatorial staff is well known and this little remark from Stowers exemplifies his problem. His colleagues seemed oblivious to distinctions that would have been obvious to Sherwood Taylor. The World of Science was a general science textbook and was not concerned with history. The only names in the index came with eponymous phenomena, such as \u2018Heaviside-Kennelly layer\u2019 or \u2018Newton\u2019s rings\u2019. On the other hand, Sherwood Taylor\u2019s A short history of science, published in 1939, had several references to Leonardo, including a short but positive section specifically devoted to him and a reproduced drawing.\u00a0\nSherwood Taylor agreed to the suggestion of writing to possible collaborators and Gilbert and Stowers prepared a draft letter, choosing the British Museum as the first recipient and asking whether there were any plans for an exhibition.[13] The Science Museum could offer a few models, a selection of photographs, and staff assistance with an appropriate section of a general exhibition."},

This is not usually an \u2018abstract or theoretical concern\u2019 with experience, but refers, rather, to \u2018well-designed means for attracting cultural consumers by catering to their needs in a stimulating environment of sought-after memorable events\u2019 (Bubaris, 2014, p 393). Writing in the Museums Journal, Sharp (2013) further suggests that sound effects in museums are primarily a \u2018cost-effective means of engaging visitors\u2019, providing \u2018an immersive experience\u2019 to enhance or replace the traditional object-plus-text exhibition format. Museum scholars have nevertheless welcomed this turn to sound as a necessary corrective to the \u2018pervasive and long-standing belief that museums are places of silence\u2019 (Bubaris, 2014, p 391). In museums, according to Bubaris, \u2018a meaningful sound environment\u2019 can now rightfully become a \u2018valuable practice of knowledge,\u2019 drawing us into embodied connection with artefacts and their stories (Bubaris, 2014, p 391\u2013392). Scholarly celebrations of the possibilities of museum sound tend to focus on the argument that sound may facilitate the multiplication of narrative and interpretation in exhibitions. Bubaris argues that \u2018The sonic culture of silence is intertwined with the communicative model of transmitting precisely defined cultural information \u2013 the cultural equivalent of a metaphysical presence speaking the truth as the ultimate source of knowledge\u2019, whereas a sound-rich exhibition is better suited to \u2018an open and pluralistic museum\u2019 where \u2018multiple interpretations\u2019 are possible (p 400). Boon (2014), similarly, hopes that sound, and musical sound in particular, will allow for the opening up of available meanings and experiences in the space of science museums, confounding misplaced confidence in \u2018the precise clarity of science communication\u2019. Boon argues that music opens \u2018inexplicit territories of meaning\u2019 for visitors, who may in turn \u2018poach\u2019, in Michel de Certeau\u2019s sense, what they need from an exhibition, becoming \u2018secondary producers\u2019, to use de Certeau\u2019s language, or \u2018co-producers\u2019, to borrow Helen Graham\u2019s (2016). There is evidence to suggest that sound may successfully facilitate plurality and multiplicity in museum display where controversial and contested historical topics are concerned. Hutchison and Collins (2009) argue that sound installation provides opportunities to create the \u2018polyphonic\u2019 and \u2018dialogic\u2019 exhibitions necessary to account for multiple perspectives on migration history, for example, and point to the value of oral history recordings as a way of presenting multiple pasts and drawing visitors into an empathetic relationship with personal testimony. Binter (2014) advocates sound as a means of reframing the history of colonial encounter in ethnographic museums. According to Binter, contextual oral history audio used alongside exhibits allows the curator to challenge both \u2018conventional occularcentric forms of display\u2019 (p 343) and the structures of power inherent in imperial collecting. What unites the existing literature on museum sound is thus a positive outlook on the sonic in which vision is associated with the old structures of authority and sound with an emancipatory opening of the museum to personal experience and to formally excluded perspectives. While Boon (2014) is right to lay down the challenge that \u2018Most museums devote much thought to how they look and virtually none to how they sound\u2019, my argument is that in thinking through museum sound we should be as critical about what sound does as we have come to be about what vision and the visual field can do. We should pause to question whether sound automatically offers a more democratic and pluralistic way of doing exhibitions, and whether it really is as straightforward a way around the \u2018visual hegemony\u2019 and \u2018occularcentrism\u2019 of western modernity as some have suggested. In cases such as those mentioned by Hutchison and Colins and by Binter, curators were already thinking critically about the politics of heritage and display, but where this is not the case, it may be all too easy for sound\u2019s routine involvement in hegemonic power \u2013 for sound is no less implicated in power than vision \u2013 to be reproduced in the museum or heritage space. Tourle\u2019s critique (2017) of the British Library/National Trust project Sounds of Our Shores offers a cautionary tale and a necessary corrective to unqualified enthusiasm about sound in museum practice. Sounds of Our Shores \u2018is a community-led, interactive soundmap\u2019 created in the summer of 2015. It was crowd-sourced by users who were asked to \u2018upload their favourite seaside sounds and help build a permanent digital resource of UK coastal recordings\u2019 (British Library). The project was intended to promote attentive listening as a means of generating appreciation of \u2018the beauty and diversity of the entire UK coast\u2019 (National Trust). Tourle argues that despite taking the appearance of an open and democratic exercise in crowd-sourcing sonic heritage, the Sounds of Our Shores project in fact directed its users in a particular \u2018mode of listening\u2019 (p 238). He argues that in its emphasis on natural beauty, the promotion of the project to contributors explicitly situated the listening mode as touristic. The project \u2018discursively privileged and materially preselected sounds that reproduce the coast as a site of leisure and natural beauty\u2019 (p 243). Tourle points out that the conceptualisation of the coastline as natural resource, generated by the predominant acoustic ecology logic in sonic heritage practice, diverted attention away from coastal areas as places where working-class communities \u2018live, work and struggle\u2019 (p 242) and, more unfortunately still, served to occlude the role of the British coast as an imaginative frontier and site of noisy protest during the \u2018migrant crisis\u2019 that coincided with the collecting phase of the Sounds of Our Shores project. Tourle concludes that even as the project \u2018opened up the sonic environment to its audiences as a new field of experience\u2019, its setup \u2018worked to discipline public listening, aestheticising and domesticating the sonic, wresting from it the power to disrupt hegemonic narratives of nation\u2019 (p 244). Sure enough, in a subsequent poll run by the National Trust to find \u2018the UK\u2019s favourite coastal sound\u2019, the \u2018sound of gentle waves breaking on the beach\u2019 came out on top (National Trust). Tourle\u2019s theorisation of socially-shaped modes of listening, a concept he borrows from sound studies and critical race theorist Jennifer Stoever-Ackerman (2010), and his investigation of the \u2018boundaries of acceptable listening\u2019 operating in heritage practice (p 244), open the critical terrain which should in my opinion be necessary to those wishing to work with sound in museums. The Sounds of Our Shores project did not set out to silence the noise of protest, quotidian drudgery or cries for help, but nevertheless did so by framing the sonically valuable in such a way as to foreground particular national and class modes of listening. Ironically, perhaps, the museum studies literature on \u2018ways of seeing\u2019 further maps out the kind of critical attention to sound that I wish to make a case for here. Theorists of the senses argue that the encounter between a visual object and a seer must be socially shaped to be made meaningful. Howes and Classen (2014) argue that \u2018Perception is informed not only by the personal meaning a particular sensation has for us, but also by the social values it carries\u2019 (p 1). Museum theorists such as Bennett (2011) argue that museums shape visual perception in the interests of certain fields of visual meaning at the expense of others. Bennett points to the ways in which nineteenth-century museums, for example, promoted Darwinistic ways of seeing nature. The effect described by Bennett was achieved in the museum by explainers and textual information, but also by the visual logics of collecting and display. Rees Leahy (2014) notes that in attempting to re-stage historical art exhibitions, curators must appreciate the importance of the \u2018period eye\u2019, a particular way of encountering visual imagery specific to an historical period, or, to put it another way, \u2018the cultural-constructedness of vision\u2019, or a \u2018set of viewing norms\u2019 (p 286) which both artists and gallery-goers understood at the time of an original exhibition, but which no longer translate straightforwardly into our changed ways of seeing. Such theories of the historical shaping of sight are now widely accepted and understood, but are not routinely applied to sound.Yet our perception of sound is also shaped socially. We hear historically. Sound is not intrinsically multiple, dialogic or pluralistic, but may be presented as such in a museum \u2018way of hearing\u2019. Museums are, in fact, powerful shapers of our social ways of encountering sound because they have the authority and opportunity to direct sonic behaviour and perceptual attention. The expected norm of quietly contemplating an art work was actively produced by those who sought to use the art gallery as a tool of civilization (Hill, 2005). Bubaris (2014) notes that \u2018It is no coincidence that sound is more acceptable in museums that do not have the \u2018aura\u2019 of high culture, for example, in science centres and temporary exhibitions, rather than in the permanent collections of art museums\u2019 (p 392). This same process was at work in the way that concert hall audiences were enculturated into certain ways of behaving around symphonic music, sitting silently during and even between movements and clapping at the appropriate time. Johnson (1995), Weber (1975) and others have pointed to these sonic codes of conduct, which rarefied \u2018absolute music\u2019, as fundamental to the coming into being of middle-class identity and the rise of notions of civility in the nineteenth century. Quiet, in this context, became loaded with class connotations, a consequence of civilization rather than an acoustic category. It operated, powerfully, in the class-bound social imaginary of early twentieth-century Britain, as the next section of this article will show. If, as Rich suggests (this issue), we have overlooked the extent to which sound has historically featured in museums, then we must certainly have been inattentive to the extent to which museums, perhaps no less than concert halls, organised and shaped historical, class-bound, or otherwise socially-interested, ways of hearing. What is audible or otherwise, and what is auditorily welcomed or rejected, is no less of an historical or political matter than what the visual field does or does not admit as knowable and true. We must, therefore, do more to take account of museum ways of hearing."},

The first is due to material identification. In order to manage an object effectively it is crucial to know, or at least be able to make a well-informed assumption, about the types of materials present. This is because identifying the material type may determine conservation treatment decisions, such as the selection of adhesives and cleaning agents, as well as influencing long-term decisions about care and storage conditions.\nKnowing how far generalisations can be made about the materials used in constructing doped fabric aircraft will, in addition, have major implications for determining how far conservation treatment and collections care decisions can be applied across an entire collection as opposed to on a case-by-case basis.\nBeyond the material type, moreover, understanding why aircraft designers and manufacturers selected certain materials provides conservators with a much better insight into the outcomes and results they were hoping to achieve. As noted above, shrinkage of the fabric to make it taut was the primary purpose of applying dope to the fabric, but it was by no means the only consideration. Other requirements of doped fabric are summarised in Table 1, but this list is not exhaustive, and other considerations could be added, such as economy and ease of use.\nTable 1\u00a0 Summary of the requirements of doped fabrics and examples of materials used in their construction\n\u00a0\n\nThese requirements are important to consider from a conservation perspective since they inform our understanding of how and why an object is significant, both in terms of its tangible and intangible values. They are the intentions and values of the original makers as represented through the materiality of the object itself, and for conservators it is important that there is an awareness of how interventions might affect the way these intentions and values are manifested in the object. A conservation treatment, for example, that sought to stabilise a tear by removing the tautness throughout the doped fabric might be very effective at preventing further tearing, but would have serious ethical implications because of its impact on one of the most fundamental thought processes underpinning the creation of doped fabric aircraft, namely the desire of the original makers to create as taut a material as possible.\nThe section below discusses in more detail some of the specific materials identified from the historic literature as components of doped fabric, and considers why these were selected by aircraft designers and manufacturers. Furthermore, it considers how and why the presence of these materials may have implications from a conservation perspective.\nFabrics\nThe selection of fabric was an important consideration for doped-aircraft manufacturers as historic studies found that the properties of the doped fabric were strongly related to the type of fabric yarn selected and its processing to create a finished textile. It seems that there was initially a general preference for Irish linen (Linum usitatissimum), since this was found in experiments to have the greatest tensile strength (Walen, 1918; Esselen, 1918; Turner, 1920). This tensile strength, however, came at the cost of increased stiffness, and some authors argued that cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) would provide a better alternative since, although not as strong as Irish linen under tensile loading, it did have greater elasticity, enabling it to resist tearing under the types of load actually experienced during flight (Walen, 1920; Ramsbottom, 1924).\nA third alternative was mercerised cotton. Mercerisation is a process in which the yarn fibres are soaked in strongly alkaline conditions, and recent studies have shown that this causes a reorganisation of the crystalline structure of the cellulose chains that make up the fibre yarns, increasing the amount of hydrogen bonding between polymers (Wertz et al, 2010). Mercerised cotton was, therefore, found to have a greater tensile strength than non-mercerised cotton while still retaining much of its elasticity.\nThe debate as to which fabric was better appears to have never been truly settled and remained an open question. The USA, in particular, seems to have preferred mercerised cotton over Irish linen, though this may in large part have been down to problems of supply and the greater costs involved in the import of Irish linen to the USA (Catoe, 1962).\nThe only significant alternative to cotton or linen was silk, although this seems to have been dropped relatively quickly as a material in most countries before the First World War. There may have been a number of factors behind this, such as its high cost and problems of its rapid deterioration in exterior conditions. Another material investigated was ramie (Boehmeria nivea), although this seems to have never received any significant attention or use beyond experimental research (Turner, 1920).\nThe fabrics discussed above, barring silk, are all derived from naturally occurring plant materials, whose principal component is cellulose. Cellulose is a long-chain polymer molecule in which the separate chains are bonded together by hydrogen bonding (see Figure 4). The properties of cellulose have a major impact on the final characteristics of the different plants that it constitutes. Variations, such as in the length of the cellulose chains, how well ordered and closely packed together these chains are, and whether the cellulose chains are present in a matrix with other materials, mean that different plant materials can have very different material properties (Hon, 1994).\nThis variation in fabric selection may be of significance to conservation because of the differences in the behaviour and deterioration one might expect from these materials. Cotton, for example, is primarily made of cellulose with relatively few impurities compared with linens, which often contain a much higher proportion of other compounds, such as lignin, hemicelluloses, waxes and oils, depending on how they are prepared and processed (McDougall, 1993).\nThese impurities have been found to be far less chemically stable than the cellulose content, and increase the likelihood of reactions causing undesired changes in fabrics, particularly under exposure to light radiation and/or oxygen. The main observable alterations might include colour changes, such as yellowing, and a decrease in the tensile strength and flexibility of the material (Hallett and Bradley, 2003). Of particular concern is the release of acidic compounds by the breakdown of the impurities under exposure to light, since this can lead to acid hydrolysis of the cellulose, which shortens the cellulose chains, leading to a marked reduction in strength (Seery, 2013).\nExposure to light was observed to be a major cause of deterioration in doped fabrics during the early years of flight, when it was noted that aircraft fabrics deteriorated much faster during summer months compared with winter ones. Further testing using more controlled light sources as well as sending test pieces out to places with high light levels, such as Iraq and Egypt, gradually established that it was the more energetic UV rays of sunlight that were causing most damage (Ramsbottom, 1924; Atkins and Woodcock, 1917; Wendt, 1922; Padfield, 1969).\nBesides light, another problem encountered with aircraft fabrics was moisture exposure. During periods of high humidity, moisture uptake would cause fabrics to \u2018slacken off\u2019, the tautness being restored once the relative humidity (RH) dropped again and the fabric was able to dry out. This indicates that expansion and contraction cycles of the material occur, which are dependent on cycling of the RH conditions. This type of cycling has been established to be a cause of damage and deterioration in various types of museum materials that conservators deal with, such as ivory, wood and those in paintings, and it seems probable that it would play a part in the deterioration of doped fabric (Michalski, 2011).\nExposure to high RH levels, in addition, risks organic growth developing, such as mould. This is a health and safety issue for those who might have to work with the objects owing to the release of spores into the atmosphere. It can also lead to a weakening of the material, as studies have shown that organic growth on objects can release enzymes that break down the cellulose (Edwards and Falk, 1997). Such a process causes the long-chain molecules of the cellulose to break down, reducing the structural integrity of the material.\nDope polymers\nThe selection of the polymer to be used in dope formulations was very important as it was this polymer that would form a film within and around the fabric fibres, causing it to shrink and grow taut. Early, pre-doped fabric aviators experimented with a number of readily available options, such as casein, glues and resins, but none were found to be particularly effective (Drinker, 1921; Smith, 1919).\nThe main group of materials discovered to be effective tauteners was cellulose esters. These are semi-synthetic plastics, in which the cellulose chain is modified by replacing a proportion of the hydroxyl groups attached to the main chain with a new chemical group (see Figure 5). Depending on the type of group used to replace the hydroxyl group, a very large number of products is theoretically possible, whose properties may further vary depending on factors such as how many hydroxyl groups are replaced, the distribution of the substituent groups along the chain, the length of the polymer molecules and the presence of impurities from the production mechanism (Zugenmaier, 2004).\nCellulose nitrate was the first cellulose ester to be used in aircraft dopes in the years before the First World War. It was a major step forward, having very good tautening powers, and set the standard against which alternative polymers would be judged for years to come (Kline and Malmberg, 1938; Reinhart and Kline, 1939; Inoue, 1941). It was, however, also highly flammable, and so more stable alternatives were sought, which led to the development of dopes based on cellulose acetate, cellulose acetate butyrate and cellulose stearate.\nEach of these cellulose derivatives has different properties and characteristics that provided them with various advantages and disadvantages. No definitive decision was ever made as to which polymer was best for tautening and all \u2013 except cellulose stearate, which appeared too late in the history of doped fabric to be widely investigated or adopted \u2013 were used in many different contexts and parts of the world (Weissberg and Kline, 1949; Meyer and Gearhart, 1944; Dreyfus, 1949; Jones and Hockney, 1944).\nThe presence of these cellulose-derived materials is a potential challenge from a conservation perspective. All of these polymers are potentially unstable, undergoing chemical degradation on exposure to various conditions, such as UV light, heat and moisture. The result of such chemical changes might be the loss of substituent side groups from the polymer chain or even scission of the main polymer chain itself, leading to a drop in molecular weight (Berthumeyrie et al, 2014; Quye et al, 2011; Selwitz, 1988). These reactions can have a significant effect on various properties of the material, such as its colour, tensile strength, flexibility and acidity.\nAs with cellulosic fabrics, light is particularly damaging to objects containing cellulose derivatives. This is because the UV energy is sufficient to break the bonds holding the side groups \u2013 the acetate, nitrate or butyrate groups \u2013 to the cellulose polymer backbone. Once released, these chemical groups are then able to react with moisture to form acidic compounds. These acidic compounds then react with the main polymer cellulose chain, causing it to break down and shorten.\nThis has serious consequences for the properties of the material, since it affects the length of the polymer chain molecules. As these shorten, the tensile strength of the material is decreased as there is a greater number of weak points in the material where failure might occur. It can also result in a less extensible and more brittle material, further increasing the risk of failure. This is because the areas most vulnerable to degradation reactions tend to be amorphous portions of the material from where much of the material\u2019s flexibility is derived, and the reactions may also lead to cross-linking of the polymer chains, which again limits their ability to move past and around each other (Hon and Gui, 1986).\nThis history of the material itself, in terms of how it was produced and its quality, is also highly relevant to the issue of its conservation. When making cellulose derivative products, sulphuric acid is often used as a catalyst in order to substitute the hydroxyl groups of the cellulose chain with the required chemical group. If the final product is not then properly purified, trace sulphuric acid can remain in the material, again leading to acid hydrolysis and chain scission of the cellulose backbone.\nDope additives\nBesides the polymer of the dope responsible for forming a film, numerous other compounds might be added to manipulate the film in various ways. These could include plasticisers, fire retardants, pigments, UV reflectors and absorbers, and fungicides (see Table 1). The list of materials that might be added therefore includes, but is not limited to, items such as triphenyl phosphate, castor oil, aluminium powder, iron oxide powder, a boric acid and borax mixture, and inorganic pigments such as carbon black and yellow ochre. The proportions of the mixtures would also vary, some having higher quantities of the different components, depending on the particular manufacturer and dope purpose.\nUse of these additives significantly complicates the potential long-term behaviour and predictability of the material, as it introduces further potential reactions and processes. Metallic compounds, for example, have been found to act as catalysts in the degradation of other cellulosic materials, and triphenyl phosphate degradation is believed to potentially release phosphoric compounds which may form acids, again causing and increasing the rate of degradation reactions (Daniels, 1999; Tsang et al, 2009; Groom, 1999).\nAs well as the dope ingredients, the solvent mixture in which it was all dissolved in order to be brushed or sprayed onto the fabric could also vary significantly. Drinker (1921) reports that over fifty solvent formulations were in use at various times by the Allies during the First World War alone, which could result in unintended and unanticipated consequences. Tetrachloroethane, for example, was a common solvent in use in most countries prior to 1916, but research at the Royal Aircraft Factory indicated that when trapped within the material it could react in sunlight, releasing acidic volatile compounds which then reacted with the fabric substrate, increasing its rate of deterioration (Robertson, 1916; RAF, 1915). This, coupled with the fact it was linked with several fatalities and numerous health issues, meant it was phased out of British dopes in 1917 (Hamilton, 1918).\nOther products, such as varnishes and paints, might also be combined with the doped fabric to act as a protective coating against environmental conditions. These varnishes created a waterproof finish, and could be pigmented with metal powders or other compounds to absorb and reflect sunlight before it could reach the doped fabric. There were numerous varnishes developed during the First World War, such as Protective Coating 10 (PC10), which was a nitrocellulose-based varnish containing carbon black and yellow ochre pigments, and V84, which was a nitrocellulose varnish containing aluminium powder to absorb and reflect the energy from the Sun\u2019s rays (British Engineering Standards Association, 1918).\nThe documents stored at the NA make clear, however, that this was an area of constant change and development as new ideas and supply issues meant that new materials had to be developed. In 1918, for example, two new products named pigmented oil varnish (POV) and clear oil varnish (COV) were introduced which were made with tung oil (Vernicia fordii) and intended to replace varnishes such as PC10 and V84 because of a shortage of nitrocellulose.[1]\nTowards the end of the First World War, the British also began experimenting with pigmenting dopes directly by adding aluminium powder straight into the dope formulation. This obviated the need to add any varnish or protective coat over the doped fabric, and in time appears to have become the most widely accepted method for providing environmental protection. Such pigmented dopes, however, would only usually be applied in the very top two coats to save on weight, with the first few coats below remaining unpigmented.\nThe dope, therefore, not only made the fabric taut, but protected it from environmental factors that might cause it to weaken and fail. In this role it acted as a sacrificial material designed to protect the more expensive fabric below, and was expected to deteriorate in the environment. A time frame of 60\u201390 days was suggested before the dope should begin to show any negative signs of ageing, such as peeling away from the fabric and discolouration, when it would require replacing (Esselen, 1918). This raises an interesting conservation question as to whether conservators should necessarily attempt to preserve dope for as long as possible, or should be willing to renew it periodically given the transient nature of the material.\nDoped fabric summary\nFrom the above discussion it appears that some general assumptions can be made about doped fabrics, primarily that they will consist of some type of cellulosic fabric impregnated with a cellulose ester-based compound. It is also important to be aware of some recurring causes of deterioration. Exposure to light in particular can be highly damaging to doped fabric materials, as can exposure to fluctuating RH. More research, however, is required to establish the deterioration mechanisms taking place and how these alter the characteristics of doped fabrics.\nOn the other hand, these generalities still mask a very high degree of variability, with different materials and processes used in different times and locations. A few examples of dope recipes proposed and used in various times and parts of the world are provided in Table 2. These examples help to indicate the range of materials used just within the dope, but it is also worth remembering that this variability extends to other decisions such as the choice of fabric and the application of protective varnishes.\nFrom a conservation perspective, this means that caution is required when devising and applying treatment methodologies. Differences between doped fabrics may mean that a treatment that is effective in one context will not work as well in another. It may also mean that types of deterioration that occur for one object will not necessarily be common or expected across all types of doped fabric aircraft.\nTable 2\u00a0 Examples of different dope formulations*\n\u00a0\n"},

Not surprisingly, conservation at this museum developed from an engineering tradition of maintenance, keeping machinery in working order (so might involve regular lubrication, replacement of worn parts, removal of damaged varnish or paint, repainting, and so on). During the twentieth century there was a shift in the practice and philosophy of museum conservation towards a more scientific approach which sought to understand the chemistry of materials and the way they deteriorate, and to develop ways to prevent or halt deterioration (Rathgen, 1905; Plenderleith, 1998; Gilberg, 1987). At the same time a more conservative approach was evolving \u2013 aiming to retain as much of the fabric of the original object as possible. \u00a0Now in the twenty-first century the focus has broadened considerably to embrace questions about the motives for conservation: why are these objects being conserved; who is interested in them; and what do they want to know or experience? The emphasis now is on the whole object \u2013 not just its material constituents but what it may mean \u2013 its significance (Caple, 2000; Pye, 2001; Mu\u00f1oz Vi\u00f1as, 2005; Richmond and Bracker, 2009). Conservation today has evolved from the narrow purpose of practical repair to a well-developed discipline with its own ethics and philosophy. In major museums conservators work as part of a wider team including curators and scientists \u2013 each member contributing to an understanding of the whole object, and to conservation decisions (Ward, 1986; Pye and Sully, 2007). The conservation procedure chosen is shaped by the ethos of the museum, the principles of the conservation profession, and by the views of those with an interest in the object. Consultation of interest groups, and sometimes their involvement in the conservation process itself, has led to the evolution of what is becoming known as social or public conservation (Clavir, 2002; Sully, 2007; Salomon and Peters, 2009)."},

Broadly defined this theme embraces many of the subjects we are interested in \u2013 communication technologies, communication with our audiences, communication through different media and communication between the past and the present. The theme is especially pertinent with the opening of one of our largest permanent exhibitions \u2013 Information Age \u2013 and the gallery is discussed here in two articles. Lead curator Tilly Blyth reveals the challenges the exhibition faced in exhibiting such a complex and ephemeral topic as \u2018communications\u2019 and the approach of the gallery to participatory practice is considered by co-authors from Leicester University and the Information Age team, who explore the issues national museums face in scaling up participation projects to meet the needs of national audiences.\nBut the openness of the theme also allows the Journal to examine other aspects of communication: Aleks Kolkowski discusses a re-enactment of a 1913 acoustic recording to explore the impact of early recording techniques on the experience of both playing for and listening to recorded music. In many ways the re-enactment itself allowed music students to communicate with their historical predecessors, and the work foreshadows planned research into the Museum\u2019s fascinating collection of early music recorders. Sally Shuttleworth also looks at how the past speaks to the present, but in the field of citizen science \u2013 an area on the rise today but with its roots firmly in the Victorian era.\nThe Journal continues its intention to feature research from authors outside the Science Museum Group, and here we welcome Michael Kay\u2019s look at the impact of non-users of the developing telephone system in the UK. His approach, though from a different perspective to that of an exhibition team, supports the idea that an understanding of technological development is made richer by considering the ways people encountered it, and especially by exploring untold stories and varieties of user experience. Andrea Bandelli brings a European perspective in his examination of audiences\u2019 appetite for participation in museums and for museums to be involved in policy making. Perhaps communication with political stakeholders is something that museums will be doing more of in the future?\nThe ultimate aim of the Journal is to communicate some of the extraordinary and fascinating research that goes on inside science museums and universities around the world. We hope that you enjoy this issue and will discuss and share with friends and colleagues.\n"},

Those who had grown up in a fragmented print-based visual sequential culture were plunged into a new auditory world of simultaneous information created by radio. \u00a0The microphone promised to do for the ear what the microscope had done for the eye. Whilst the telephone provided a physical extension of the human sense of hearing over a distance, the microphone promised a magnification-like function that would enable people to hear sounds that they had never heard before.Until about 1920, gramophone recordings were made by direct sound impact, shouting or singing into a horn. Between 1920 and 1922, Peel-Conner carbon granule microphones were the standard in British wireless broadcasting.\nIn early 1923, an electro-dynamic microphone which worked on the same principle as a telephone earpiece came into use. It was more sensitive than the early carbon microphones, but had limited frequency response. Its designer, the first chief engineer of the Marconi Company Captain Henry Joseph Round, attempted to deal with its limited frequency characteristics by using four of them in parallel, along with ten stages of amplification, to pick up something resembling the full range of human hearing. Four of these massive instruments \u2013 they weighed twenty pounds each \u2013 were mounted in a wooden box, with four large ports at the front, on a tripod. \u2018Like a howitzer battery,\u2019 wrote BBC chief engineer Peter Eckersley in Popular Wireless (West, 1972, p 17). A higher quality, more practicable microphone was needed to help the fledgling medium of broadcast radio appeal to a wider public."},

It was about changing the public perception of this museum as being primarily a dinosaur museum. One of the reasons behind the decision to replace Dippy as the central specimen of Hintze Hall was that senior staff in our Public Engagement Group had visited other natural history museums around the world and seen the changes being made and understood that we had to change with regard to refreshing our public offer. But science was also a driver for change, because we needed to ensure that our science was more visible, was seen as being world class, relevant, contemporary and part of the attempts to address the big questions facing our planet.\nMiranda Lowe: I wonder whether Blue Planet II [the BBC oceanic wildlife series] was also on the radar, because it was already being filmed. The Museum would have seen an opportunity there. We already had a relationship with Sir David Attenborough, so the timing of that decision could have been related, but it was also about showing more real specimens from our collections to the public.\nIt was also around the time of Coral Reefs: Secret Cities of the Sea (2015), which was seen as instigating a new era of exhibitions for the Museum because it was specimen rich. It contained 250 specimens \u2013 many of which had not been seen since 1907. Outside the Museum\u2019s Jerwood gallery, where the exhibition was held, had been the historical Coral gallery, so the location was significant. A lot of the specimens that I work with from the deep ocean are small and there are challenges associated with displaying them so that people can understand and appreciate them. This exhibition was a great opportunity to show larger coral specimens and bring them back into the Museum along with their stories, because they are usually stored offsite.\nAlso at that time, the Chagos Archipelago was a political issue, both socially and due to climate change studies. [The British government had faced criticism for designating that area as a Marine Protected Area (MPA) in 2010, which at that time was one of the largest in the world. Then in 2015, the Hague deemed the MPA against international law, amidst continuing litigation on behalf of displaced islanders and Mauritian sovereignty claims.] We have a huge collection of nearly 7,000 corals from that area from three expeditions in the 1970s. There were lots of requests for data at this time and I was responsible for determining how to manage that data, in turn, within a political agenda for the native Chagossians who had been moved from the islands. The Museum had to manage those climate change messages and the political issues in a certain way.\nRS: The redisplay was also part of the masterplan strategy for the Museum, which stated that all of the permanent public galleries were going to be replaced, starting with a complete reimagining of everything in Hintze Hall. In January 2014, I was invited to the first meeting of the Hintze Hall Project Group, comprised of staff from across the Museum. In that initial meeting, Ian Owens, our Director of Science, said to me: \"Richard, the first thing I\u2019ve got to tell you is that from now on, you are going to be known as the Dippy Killer!\" That was when the news was delivered that we were all in the room to think about a replacement for the central specimen in Hintze Hall. I had understood change was coming, but I hadn\u2019t realised that it was going to be as substantial as taking out the iconic specimen that had effectively become the emblem of the Museum.\nSW: Were there discussions around shifting ideas of extinction and the increased momentum and public awareness about ecological issues as part of that decision?\nRS: Those key topics were discussed when, in that same meeting, we were given the criteria that needed to be addressed when deciding on the hundreds of replacement specimens needed for Hintze Hall. These were based on the Museum\u2019s main research areas \u2013 origins and evolution, sustainability and biodiversity. We also had to take on board the additional criteria that the specimens had to be genuine. Not replicas; not facsimiles. The specimens had to be representative of our science, our research collections and they also had to have a \u2018good story\u2019 attached to them.\nBut then something else was thrown into the mix: the new, central specimen was not going to be positioned on the floor like Dippy; it was going to be suspended from above. This was to facilitate flow into and through the hall, into the Wonder Bays, up to the balcony level and on to other parts of the Museum. As soon as we were told the specimen had to be suspended, it reduced the number of available options. My first idea actually wasn\u2019t the blue whale. It was the skeletons of 147 false killer whales in our marine mammal research collection, which were part of a mass stranding in 1927 from the East Coast of Scotland. I suggested creating a pod of around fifty articulated skeletons and presenting them swimming through the space, but then somebody sensibly said \u2018think of all the cables\u2019! I then realised that the biggest thing we had in our collection that addressed all of the required criteria was already on display: the blue whale.\nHope \u2013 the name ultimately given to the blue whale skeleton \u2013 has created a great visual experience: a new spectacle. However, all of the associated messaging \u2013 the significance of this being a species from a remarkably diverse group of animals taken by humans to the edge of extinction, then saved at the last minute through incredible international cooperation \u2013 enabled the Museum to reposition itself as a natural history museum for the future.\nSW: I\u2019m just thinking about the other oceanic displays present in Hintze Hall: the blue marlin, the coral and the seaweeds in the Wonder Bays. Miranda, what was your role in the decision-making about the coral display?\nML: The Hintze Hall Project Group approached departmental curators about the individual Wonder Bays, asking what the biggest thing we had in our collections was. As manager for marine invertebrates at that time, the biggest thing that I had was either the coral currently on display or a giant clam. The Turbinaria coral was displayed in Coral Reefs and I did not want it to go back into storage after that exhibition. I wanted it to remain on display to communicate an important message about the oceans, concerning biodiversity, symbiosis and the potential for coral reefs to recover from ecological devastation.\nRS: There had also been discussion about the \u2018Index Museum\u2019, Richard Owen\u2019s original plan for the arrangement of specimens in the Central Hall when the Museum opened in 1881. The Hintze Hall redisplay did not initially coalesce around the idea of the oceans necessarily. However, we were discussing an oceans season at the time, spurred on by Miranda\u2019s 'Coral Reefs' exhibition, and I was working on 'Whales: Beneath the Surface'.\nML: Yes, that\u2019s right. After the coral exhibition, the template going forward was that exhibitions would be specimen rich. The beauty of the coral exhibition was that after seeing the dead corals, you would go around the corner and then see the aquarium of live corals and a film about how this had been developed. That was great.\nPandora Syperek: Can you reflect on the role of the curator and the ideal of scientific neutrality when it comes to producing exhibitions? Unlike the art world, in which curators regularly claim authorship \u2013 think of the \u2018star curator\u2019 \u2013 science and natural history curators frequently work in teams and are rarely publicly credited.\nML: I have a colleague who is responsible for the Southeast Asian collections at the British Museum. When the British Museum opened an exhibition relating to these collections, as well as being the curator of the objects, she was also credited as the curator of the exhibition and profiled in the media as such. It does not necessarily happen like this at the Natural History Museum because we have an Exhibitions department and often a member of that team is credited as the curator of the exhibition. The 'Coral Reefs' exhibition was the first time that I was credited as the curator of the exhibition as well as the researcher. It has always been an issue for me that natural history curators do not get credited more: the Exhibitions department comes to us for the stories because we have massive insight into the collections; yet, we do not always get the recognition. It works so differently in the art world. Why?\nSW: Do you think it is because of the expectation that what you are doing at the Museum, and what the public come to see, is \u2018science\u2019, and so it has to be presented as \u2018fact\u2019 rather than something that\u2019s been constructed, which, as we all know, natural history displays are?\nRS: Possibly, but actually we have engaging personalities and an ability to communicate across audiences that goes well with our jobs. Miranda and I are excellent at presenting and are both experts in our fields, so we often get asked to front things for the Museum. We are both part of a suite of collections and research individuals at the Museum that are known to be able to represent the institution well.\nOne of the things that really made a difference to our degree of involvement with Hintze Hall is that the Museum started to offer secondments from the science departments to the Exhibitions department. Curators would spend six months developing temporary exhibitions, contributing their in-house expertise.\nML: I did a secondment in Exhibitions and I briefly worked on the Treasures gallery because I wanted a whole gallery of the Blaschka models!\nPS: This was the gallery that started to speak to the cultural history of natural history. I want to ask about the directive for there to be no facsimiles in the redisplay of Hintze Hall and that all of the specimens should be originals. This was one of the arguments driving the replacement of Dippy with Hope, because Dippy was a cast. But does the ideal of authenticity come into conflict with the ideal of spectacle?\nRS: This came from our then Director of Exhibitions, who was determined that replicas should not be shown and believed that authenticity was key. I would argue that it\u2019s a questionable position to take because Dippy is a replica of a very valuable and fragile dinosaur fossil [the Diplodocus carnegii at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], and if anything, Dippy has become more famous than the original dinosaur specimen in the USA. We have been making replicas of our precious fossils to send on loan to our scientific colleagues around the world for decades. Now we are routinely digitising our collections to make them more accessible and doing exactly the same thing across all taxa. People are seeing digital replicas of our collections and are fine with that, because they understand the reasons why they have been created and the roles they play in research and education. The argument that a display of a replica is somehow cheating the viewer is a weak one, when the replica itself may have a wide range of intrinsic values.\nML: When I did my secondment in Exhibitions, they were carrying out an evaluation about whether visitors thought Dippy was real or not. So, in some way those results might have determined what was to come in the redisplay.\nSW: This point is really interesting in relation to your obvious obsession with the Blaschka models, Miranda. Is thinking about models versus specimens different for you?\nML: I do find myself calling the Blaschka models specimens. That\u2019s how they are documented in the registers. They were sold under scientific names as specimens, even though they were glass models. I do separate them with regard to authenticity though \u2013 I think more in terms of the Blaschkas making the real Blaschka models, the time period in which they were made, the craftsmanship and who may have added things to them. So I look at the issue of authenticity in that context.\nPS: Does the goal of authenticity clash with the reality of display practices then? For example, in the dramatically articulated whale skeleton in Hintze Hall, or in situations where models can communicate more successfully than \u2018real\u2019 specimens?\nRS: We had to make replacement elements to include in Hope\u2019s skeleton, so she is not entirely \u2018authentic\u2019. Back in 1891, the Museum was sent an incomplete skeleton and we didn\u2019t realise that the technicians who mounted the skeleton in the Mammals gallery in the 1930s had used shaped pieces of wood to fill the gaps. When our conservators got a close look at Hope\u2019s flippers in 2016, they discovered that some of the \u2018finger\u2019 bones on the right-hand side were actually made from wood. So we used 3D digital scan data taken from the complete left flipper and then mirrored this to create models of the missing bones on the right.\nWe couldn\u2019t simply have the whale redisplayed in Hintze Hall the same way that it was historically presented in the Mammals gallery. The old position \u2013 horizontally mounted, flippers flat against the sides of the body \u2013 just displayed the relative proportions of the animal and indicated nothing about its movement or behaviour. I had been following the work of a US research group for years that were placing data-recording tags onto blue whales in the Pacific, looking at their diving, feeding behaviour and general locomotion. When the BBC stepped in and started to film the Museum\u2019s project work on redisplaying Hope\u2019s skeleton, they invited me to work in the field with that research team. It was a golden opportunity to turn my months of reading research papers into making first-hand observations. Along with the research data, I was able to inject all of the dynamism, the acrobatics and the beautiful feeding movements that I saw directly into the redisplay of Hope\u2019s skeleton. Her spectacular diving, lunge-feeding posture in Hintze Hall is completely based on our current scientific understanding of these animals.\nSW: It would be good to talk about anthropomorphism, which was present in the title of the coral exhibition: 'Coral Reefs: Secret Cities of the Sea', as a way to enhance understanding. Could you speak to this from your perspective? It\u2019s something that is often frowned upon in science, but has great potential for museum displays and exhibitions.\nML: This is the way I frame it with children. Being a STEM ambassador, I go to a lot of schools and talk about coral reefs. I use a hook about how corals are like hotels, and many different kinds of animals live there. It works because you need many levels of engagement for different types of audiences. I was ultimately happy with that title, because the exhibition was for a family audience and there needed to be multiple layers of interpretation running throughout.\nAnother challenge we faced was that under the ocean, the coral and coral reefs and all of the animals in this habitat are diverse and very colourful. But all of the dead coral specimens are beige! We had the aquarium at the end of the exhibition because this is what you actually see in a reef.\nSW: It was a beautiful exhibition. Anthropomorphism can be strategic when it comes to engaging people with things that are difficult to understand, so it is interesting to hear you talk about how using it with children is helpful.\nML: We wanted to engage people with coral and the plight of the coral reefs. These human interactions with reefs need to be highlighted. But we did not want the exhibition to be just doom and gloom; we wanted to make clear that there are things that can be done. For example, when particular reefs die out, some species can regenerate. But are we happy with less diverse reefs? All these questions arise. One of the reasons for having the aquarium at the end of the exhibition was to raise the mood.\nRS: With 'Whales: Beneath the Surface', initially I was really against anthropomorphism, because there has been, and still is, a tendency to use misleading language that overly humanises these animals. But I learned to embrace anthropomorphism. I understand that certain aspects of whale evolution, adaptation, biology and migration are quite complex and that the ocean is an entirely alien environment. But, ultimately, we needed to raise people\u2019s awareness that the whales and dolphins that they are drawn to and fascinated by are air-breathing mammals just like they are, and that cetacean ancestors returned to the ocean after adapting to life on land \u2013 something that people don\u2019t generally know. We wanted people to be able to empathise with these animals which have adapted incredibly well over time to live in the hostile environment of the ocean, but to understand that they are now facing issues that have been created by us and our activities on land. Was an empathic response the right way to tackle things? Actually, it was difficult not to elicit that kind of response from people. One of the things that has happened in behavioural studies in natural history over the past decade is that we have realised that there are lots of species that have behaviours and cultures that are passed on through various learning mechanisms which are very comparable to those of humans. Anthropomorphism can work to find areas of common ground.\nPS: Regarding how human histories feed into curating in the Natural History Museum, Miranda, could you speak to how your work with Museum Detox and your recently co-authored article with Subhadra Das (Das and Lowe, 2018) relate to your work with the nonhuman in the Museum?\nML: Museum Detox was formed in 2014, essentially out of a need for Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic professionals within the museum and cultural sector, including art galleries, archives and libraries, to find a safe space to talk about how they feel about being a very few individuals within these organisations. On that personal level it was about being a supportive collective for those people to air their views. Initially, it was just to get together for a drink. But five years later it has turned into something much more because of the current focus on decolonisation, particularly in museum spaces, many of which, such as the Natural History Museum, are built off the back of slavery \u2013 Hans Sloane\u2019s wife Elizabeth owned a sugar plantation, owned slaves. For Museum Detox and decolonising projects, it is about that story being told and, more importantly, being acknowledged.\nThe Museum and many other cultural organisations were commemorating 200 years since the end of the transatlantic slave trade in 2007. I finally got an opportunity to put the idea out there in 2017 through the Natural Sciences Collections Association (NatSCA) conference, because the theme was \u2018provocations\u2019. Subhadra Das, a curator of the Francis Galton Collection in eugenics at University College London, was thinking about racism in the collections she looks after, although they are not natural history, but it feeds in because Galton was Darwin\u2019s cousin. Subhadra and I delivered a talk and it was very well received. After that conference we were encouraged to publish a paper. The case studies in the paper tie into Hope, because having the whale hanging from the ceiling draws people\u2019s eyes up to look at what is known as the \u2018gilded canopy\u2019 [the Museum\u2019s Arts and Crafts ceiling frescoes featuring botanical specimens]. I teased out one particular story about Graman Kwasi [the Surinamese freedman and healer]. It is quite a lovely story that Carl Linnaeus named the medicinal plant Quassia amara after Kwasi, that a person of colour has been acknowledged that way. However, Kwasi sold his recipe to Linnaeus\u2019s student who brought it back to Europe, and by selling it he bought his freedom as well. You could ask: who\u2019s profiting off that legacy of a person of colour? With decolonisation and talking about this subject, I get the sense that people are quite fearful about it within certain parts of the museum sector, because within art they have been doing this for a long time. In natural history, those stories are not cited very often.\nPS: You write that there is a \u2018\u201chard science\u201d lens\u2019 that limits those types of stories coming through (Das and Lowe, 2018: 8). Do you think there is a shift to include more of the cultural history behind natural history within the Museum?\nML: Well, people have seen the article and they\u2019ve seen the response. People outside of this museum and the natural history world have taken this up in all sorts of guises. I have done a Black Natural History tour of the Hintze Hall, including those stories and artefacts, or pictures of people to weave into those stories. So this is the shape of things to come.\nSW: Richard, can we ask about your interest in and work on the illegal wildlife trade and how you marry this with the curatorial work you do at the Natural History Museum?\nRS: Since working as a mammals curator at the Natural History Museum, I have developed the identification work I do in support of the UK Wildlife Crime Unit and international endangered species law enforcement. I conduct identification of materials seized by law enforcement agencies, using the research collections at the Museum as reference. Though this actually only represents a small part of my job, the significance of biodiversity loss, ecosystem degradation and extinction of species are always at the forefront of everything I do. A significant percentage of the species that I work with are on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, meaning they are threatened, endangered or critically endangered. This influences everything we do, from how we manage the security of our collections, to dealing with permits and licencing for specimens being sent out on loan to other institutions, to the way that we develop content, narratives and interpretation for our public exhibitions.\nSW: Is there anywhere in the Museum where that story is told?\nRS: Not explicitly. Certain installations such as the world record African elephant tusks in the Mammals gallery do address poaching and the illegal wildlife trade, but this is focused very specifically on elephant ivory and not the broader, global issues or the cultural drivers behind some of these.\nSW: It comes back to the issue that cultural history is not always present in the Museum.\nRS: We have begun to present in more detail the origins of natural history as a discipline and some of the key founding individuals who are associated with the Museum on the Hintze Hall mezzanine level. However, there is much more that we could do to explore changing societal and scientific attitudes towards collecting and our relationships with the natural world through time. Our former Director of Science, Ian Owens, wanted the new Hintze Hall to be a place where visitors and staff could have challenging conversations about the issues affecting our planet.\nML: It comes back to the fact that museums are not neutral. People need to feel comfortable to have these debates in these institutions.\nPS: What about your work with contemporary artists \u2013 how is that a move away from showing a supposedly neutral vision of science to incorporate cultural history?\nRS: I was interviewed by an artist recently, who asked me about my thoughts on what is considered to be the separation between art and science. I told her that I do not think there is a separation. I see art and science as branches stemming from the same creative tree. There is a creative mind-set of observation, examination, interpretation and presentation that artists and scientists both share. Both use the same processes, but present things to audiences in very different ways. I like to think that scientists and artists see the same things, but through very different lenses. Art and science are in no way exclusive, but in fact interdependent. Consider for example the dependence that the early scientists had on artists to record and represent what they were seeing, what they were observing, often for the first time, in those centuries before the development of photography and film.\nPS: The Blaschka models are a case in point.\nRS: There is an artist who regularly works with me in the research collections of large mammal skeletons held at our off-site store. She is producing views of fantastic specimens usually only seen by Natural History Museum staff or visiting scientists. My hope is that we can put together an exhibition of her work to be viewed by the general public, providing another way of experiencing our \u2018behind-the-scenes\u2019 collections.\nML: I worked with the haute couture fashion designer Deborah Milner, who used to work with Alexander McQueen and focuses on ecologically aware design. She was inspired by the Coral Reefs exhibition and she emailed me to explain that she was thinking of creating a sustainable fashion range inspired by coral reefs (Regenerating the Reef, 2018). She came to the offsite store with a textile designer and beader, and they were really amazed that I let them handle the corals. It\u2019s great working with artists. They give you other insights into what you are looking at, visually, and how they interpret it. It was really fun, me explaining the science and all about the reefs to them.

Specifically, the exhibition would set out to remind those aware and to inform those that were not of the early years of space exploration when the Soviet Union dominated the headlines (from c.1957 and the USSR\u2019s launching of the first Sputnik satellite to 1966 and its first soft landing on the Moon of the remotely controlled spacecraft, Luna 9). This was a time when the United States appeared to be struggling with its own space programme; a period all but eclipsed for some by the magnitude of the Apollo Moon landing missions that followed at the end of the 1960s. Apollo dazzled and dominated the television and the press, a supreme technological and organisational achievement, supported by an equally effective campaign of promotion and publicity by the National Aeronautical and Space Administration (NASA).\u00a0 The Moon landings etched a powerful public memory of space exploration highlighting American achievement and almost excising the Soviet successes that had preceded it. The exhibition would therefore \u2018be revelatory: artefacts and images from the Russian space programme, for so long eclipsed by the American, will be displayed in the United Kingdom for the very first time; the stories of the people and personalities behind the space missions, so long hidden from the world, will be told\u2019.[2] Its proposal emphasised the authenticity of the objects to be displayed: \u2018Headlining will be a remarkable high-impact collection of real space hardware including flown capsules, rocket engines, flight spare satellites, probes and landers.\u2019 Significant as these artefacts would be the exhibition would not be solely \u2018a simple parade and revelation of technologies and technocratic achievement\u2019. The exhibition would include also \u2018vivid threads and perspectives from the visual and decorative arts that help place Russian space activity in a wider cultural context of the nation\u2019.[3]This addressed further but focused more accurately on an implicit, existing Science Museum objective of situating science and technology in a broader and more relevant social setting; one that would relate to potential Museum audiences, groups that traditionally had felt remote and disconnected from scientific and technical subjects. However, it reflected also a growing corpus of Soviet and Russian space history scholarship which was moving the focus on from the received accounts that emphasised the technological and the political \u2013 usually as inevitable outcomes of post-Second World War confrontation between east and west, and towards studies of what had been a far deeper and more sophisticated relationship of the Russian peoples with the cosmos. Similarly, concerns had been added over the traditional displaying of space artefacts in museums; Durrans, for example, argued \u2018that both public and scholarly understanding of space is poorly served by technological bias\u2026social context needs to be brought into the picture\u2019 (Durrans, 2005). In respect to the locale of the museum he added specifically that it \u2018need note only that space serves as a medium for expressing a range of social, corporate and personal interests, and that this happens both despite and because of space science, and always in close association with it\u2019.[4] He was, in effect, reminding us that the spectacle and technological blaze of space exploration was rooted in very terrestrial activities and priorities within a broad community of social actors.Collins maintained attention on the role of war in the eventual development of space technologies, suggesting such artefacts are, \u2018for the most part, products of a particular milieu \u2013 the Second World War, the Cold War and the emergence of state-sponsored big science and technology products\u2019, but highlighted also moves in the scholarship away from the geopolitical and towards more considerations of the role of the local to \u2018shift the emphasis of the [space] programme history away from high-level politics and toward the multi-faceted terrain of \u2018ground-level\u2019 engineers and managers\u2019 (Collins, 2005, p 3). This trend was illustrated well in the post-Soviet studies of the nation\u2019s space designers and engineers \u2013 often auto/biographical \u2013 that drew aside the veil of state propaganda and myth to reveal previously secret details of how they worked within the constraints of state practice and priority.[5]More significantly for the Cosmonauts exhibition and its perspectives and priorities, Siddiqi, Maurer and others had been looking in far greater detail at the cultural roots and manifestations of Russia\u2019s interest in space, showing how it extended back through the twentieth century, well into the nineteenth, involving many thousands of citizens \u2018from the ground up\u2019; their interest and activities part of a distinctive \u2018bridging [of] imagination and engineering [that was] mutable, intertwined and concurrent\u2019 (Siddiqi, 2010).[6] Far from being entirely state-driven and inevitable, Russia\u2019s exploration of space rested also on bedrock of social and civil involvement that long-pre-dated Sputnik. All of this new scholarship would both inform the intellectual thinking of the Cosmonauts exhibition\u2019s content and narrative structure but also help validate the Museum\u2019s broader aspirations \u2019to make sense of the science that shapes our lives\u2019;[7] of relating it more closely to visitors unfamiliar with or intimidated by the seeming remoteness of the subject."},

These can be summarised as follows: the idea of a \u2018national museum of photography\u2019; the art/science problematic; and the London versus the North dynamic. On each of these points our attempts to offer explanations that complicated or challenged the dominant narrative were unsuccessful in public forums, even if in private at least some of our critics could be persuaded to respect our decision. This is in large part because these powerful narratives operated as shortcuts to longer and larger political debates about inequalities and resources. At the same time, as I will demonstrate in the second section, these narratives while operating as apparently \u2018common sense\u2019 also have the effect of occluding and reinforcing other, equally problematic, power dynamics.Criticism of the Museum emanated from a range of different sources over the course of 2016, and I have drawn from a number of these including an open letter signed by 88 former members of staff and high-profile photographers published in the Observer newspaper on 6 March and an interview given by former Museum Director Colin Ford on the BBC Radio 4 programme Front Row on 10 March. Other comments have been drawn from newspaper articles, blog posts, social media posts and comments beneath the line on official statements made by the Museum in February and March.Narrative 1: \u2018the end of the National Museum of Photography\u2019There was a powerfully made argument that the transfer of the RPS collection represented the end of the comprehensive \u2018National Museum of Photography\u2019. Speaking on the BBC Radio 4 programme Front Row Colin Ford, the founding Director of the Museum, said:\nIt seems to me that every nation should have a national museum of photography, it\u2019s such an important medium, and one of the press releases that first came out with this story said that there will be no national museum of photography \u2013 which is appalling.[8]\nEamon McCabe, photographer and formerly picture editor at the Guardian recounted the circumstances that led the Museum to change its name in 2006:\nI wrote to tell the new director what I thought of the change. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he replied. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a chair in photography.\u201d \u201cA chair!\u201d I said. \u201cWe used to have a whole museum.\u201d\nCommenters beneath Jo Quinton-Tulloch\u2019s blog post of 4 February explicitly called for a national museum of photography:\nWe should be reinstating the National Museum of Photography in Bradford \u2013 with a photography specialist heading it up.[9]\nIndeed, the idea that the National Media Museum was the National Museum of Photography was actively promoted by the Museum up to 2016, with reference on the website to \u2018The National Photography Collection\u2019, and its 2010 Collecting Policy Statement claimed that:\nthese collections reflect [the Museum\u2019s] remit as the primary National resource in its subject areas.[10]\nThe idea that we were the \u2018National Museum of Photography\u2019 was a fiction \u2013 marketing language to assert the collection\u2019s significance, not to be taken literally. Many other nationally designated archives and museums in the UK hold highly significant photography collections: Tate, the National Portrait Gallery, the National Maritime Museum, the National Archives, the British Library, National Museums Northern Ireland, National Museums Wales, National Museums Scotland and, of course, the V&amp;A, all have significant collections of photography, and many more non-national museums also have important holdings. As I had taken it to be incontrovertible fact that we have in this country a distributed national collection of photography, it seemed to me that the desire to create a \u2018National Museum of Photography\u2019 was less about the needs of preserving photographic heritage, and more about making a claim for the status of photography as a distinct form of cultural production \u2013 \u2018the ultimate democratic medium, the most popular art form\u2019.[11] Odd how we never hear the same about textiles or costume, odd how we never hear the same about sculpture or watercolour painting. If we think about the benefits of a distributed national collection in terms other than status then we can see that the great benefit of a distributed anything is its resilience, its flexibility, its ability to adapt, change, reinvent itself. To take this incredibly rich heritage, to attempt to institutionalise into a \u2018National Museum of\u2026\u2019 seems to be very much a nineteenth century solution for a medium that is profoundly part of our twenty-first century lives.\nYet, looking back, I had not fully appreciated before 2016 the work that this idea was doing, or how important it was to so many people. Photographers who looked to the idea of the Museum as a validation of their status and work were upset that we were apparently downgrading its importance and, by implication, theirs. People in Bradford who saw the Museum as a validation of the city\u2019s cultural prestige were equally upset that it marked an apparent downgrading of its status, and therefore of the city itself. This traditional conception of the museum as an institution of treasures and experts has great public resonance. And yet this idea of museums is a fiction and a dangerous one: all collections are partial and imperfect; all knowledge and expertise is subjective and limited. Museums attract great public affection, but I wonder whether that is based on a misperception of museums not matched by the operational realities and one that cannot usefully persist into the twenty-first century.Narrative 2: Reinforcing a divide between art and scienceThe other major claim was that in transferring the RPS Collection the Museum was establishing a divide between \u2018art\u2019 and \u2018science\u2019 in photography. The Museum has consistently claimed that the RPS collection \u2018\u2026can be broadly defined as \u201cart photography\u201d\u2019 and that its transfer allows the Museum to focus on its core purpose as an institution of science and technology.[12] The Observer letter of 6 March clearly asserts that:\nthe present move to separate the interdependent aspects of the art and science of photography reverses prevailing worldwide practice, and takes the study of photo history in Britain back several decades.\nOn Front Row, Colin Ford elaborated on this by claiming that the Museum had been established to avoid this distinction:\n\u201cIn my day, and for some years after I left, on the front door of the Museum it said this is a museum about the art and science of photography. And our aim, it didn\u2019t always work, but our aim was you never showed a photograph without showing the sort of technology that produced it; you didn\u2019t show a camera if you didn\u2019t show the sort of pictures that it took \u2013 because they\u2019re inextricably entwined.\u201d\nSome took a slightly different approach, asserting the importance of arts over science and technology:\nIt\u2019s not scientists that produce the next blockbuster or multi million pound game. It\u2019s people with an aesthetic. That\u2019s what film, photography and digital imagery is all about. The technology is just a tool, its [sic] story telling aesthetics, meaning and emotion that takes that to global success. That\u2019s art by any other name, or at least craft which is what photographers generally describe their activities as. Not Science.[13]\nOthers were more direct:\nCan we talk about how fucking AWFUL it is that the National Media Museum is being turned into a science museum???[14]\nAnd\n#nationalmediamuseum should be about much more than ScienceTechnologyEngineeringMedicine. What about people,stories,imagination? [sic][15]\nOn reflection, we ought to have been more careful in our approach to these ideas, given the institutional and cultural histories, not to say the deeply held convictions of those committed to art and to science that they are each under-resourced and under-appreciated compared with the other.[16] As I will explore later in this paper, a distinction between photography made by artists, and photography in other contexts, is one that exists in the institutional divides between the Science Museum, the V&amp;A, Tate, and any number of other museums that hold photography. It is the National Media Museum\u2019s original sin that when we opened as the NMFPT in 1983 that we had failed to adequately resolve the distinction between collecting areas with the V&amp;A. In the years that followed its opening the Museum did set out to acquire a collection of historic photographs, in direct competition with the V&amp;A. We do have copies of, for example, the same images by Julia Margaret Cameron that are also held in not only the V&amp;A but also the National Portrait Gallery. Furthermore, as I will explore further below, the Museum deliberately excluded scientific photography, and commercial Bradford photography from its \u2018national photography collection\u2019, undermining its claim to be a comprehensive collection of all aspects of photographic culture. However, it is clear that in 2016 we failed to adequately give form to the alternative approach that we were advocating \u2013 we were clear about what we were against (art photography), but we were vague about what we were for. In this new direction for our photographic collections we plan to integrate all the many and various categories, meanings and statuses of photographs, and the lens of science and photography is central to this. Critically, this approach will focus on non-canonical photographs and photographers; photography that operates in spaces that have been neglected by the processes of institutionalising and mainstreaming photographic histories exemplified by the RPS collection.\nNarrative 3: The North-South DivideAnd finally, the most powerful of all narratives, the inequities of London compared with the regions, and specifically with the north of England. As Brighton-based art-historian Francis Hodgson put it:\nThe outrage has centred on the impoverishment of Bradford and the North of England in favour of a metropolitan cultural holding already rich in photography.[17]\nThe open letter in the Observer of 6 March indicated that the move was an apparent contradiction of the then government\u2019s publicly stated \u2018Northern Powerhouse\u2019 policy:\nMoving most of the museum\u2019s photography collection away from Yorkshire goes against government policy when the museum was opened \u2013 to put such facilities outside London \u2013 and against the present government\u2019s claimed \u2018northern powerhouse\u2019 strategy.[18]\nAlthough for Colin Ford himself, the location of the Museum was actually of little importance compared with the need for a single comprehensive National Museum of Photography:\n\u201cI\u2019m actually much more passionate about the fact that there should be a national museum of photography wherever\u2026\u201d[19]\nInterestingly two of these three narratives came together in a strong thread of comment on social media that claimed the move was motivated by a \u2018patronising\u2019 connecting of the associations of the North of England with industrial heritage and the Museum\u2019s new focus on science and technology:\nAnd as others have noted, the basic assumption of those in London\u2026is that the north can be allowed a National Museum of Pistons or some other nod to the industrial past, but that\u2019s yer lot. Sheer cultural Gradgrindery.[20]\nAnd:\nIt\u2019s nice to see that SMG believes that once you get north of Liverpool that museums dedicated to science, trains, science and trains respectively helps the whole country\u2019s access to the arts. I thought that we\u2019d got past that \u2018up there for the industrialists, down here for the aesthetes\u2019 attitude about 200 years ago but apparently not.[21]\nI would not dispute that there are inequalities on a number of different economic and social measures between London and the South East and the North of England, and specific differences in funding for cultural institutions. The 2013 report Rebalancing Cultural Capital rightly identified that not only does London take the lion\u2019s share of cultural spending in the UK, but that cultural spending decisions are also centralised in a way that is not the case in other comparator countries.[22] The NMeM Advisory Board and Board of Trustees were very conscious that they were making a decision that could be characterised as further evidence of this inequity. However, the public discussion last year tended to ignore or gloss over two significant aspects of the problem. Firstly, there was little discussion of the fact that the removal of direct subsidy from central government had reinforced this trend, as it\u2019s easier to raise money from non-public sources at the heart of the international art market and the engine room of economic growth. Like the failure to mobilise an anti-austerity argument, critics of the transfer decision seemed to be in denial about the economic facts, addressing themselves to a symptom but ignoring the systemic economic causes. Secondly, while it was often asserted that the collection ought to be located in the north, in fact under the NMeM\u2019s care the RPS collection was actually held in three separate locations: at the Museum in Bradford; at the Science Museum\u2019s storage facility at Wroughton in Wiltshire; and at the BFI\u2019s storage facility at Gaydon in Warwickshire, where there are specialist facilities for storing nitrate film. Furthermore, the physical location of a collection is a zero-sum game \u2013 for it to be somewhere, it must necessarily not be everywhere else. I would argue that it\u2019s less important where collections are held than they are invested in, made available, catalogued and digitised \u2013 activities that the V&amp;A can do in London partly because they are able to draw on private funding available from being in the cultural capital of the UK."},

Take, for example the range of articles: from an analysis of a disregarded scrapbook, to a discussion of a five-year academic study re-evaluating the quest for longitude; from a survey of the state of science communication in Latin America to a discussion of the challenge of displaying particle physics: research takes us both deeply into the detail and widely across big ideas.\nTo my delight, three articles in this issue tackle the research behind exhibitions. This is something of a coup as exhibition-making often eludes academic comment and is more usually associated with the practical skills of museum professionals. The issue also provides a glimpse of two extraordinary women, Daphne Oram and Winifred Penn-Gaskell, who doggedly pursued their interests in the male-dominated worlds of sound engineering and aeronautical collecting. Finally, the Journal highlights the importance of the image in science. Two articles explore drawings or photographs specifically \u2013 of clouds, moons and nebulae \u2013\u00a0but throughout the authors provide a visual treat, reminding us how much images add to our understanding of science, and how central science is to our visual heritage.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0"},

Although mentioned only in passing in the records of the RMCS, this was one of the most important milestones in the genesis of reliable treatment of respiratory ailments in the modern era. Affordable, suitable for self-medication, requiring only steam and cheap non-prescription medication freely available from druggists and even apothecaries (British Pharmacopoeia, 1867, pp 363\u2013364), the Dr Nelson Inhaler offered simple and reliable relief for patients with respiratory conditions. Conspicuous for its modesty and simplicity, the Dr Nelson Inhaler was one of the most widely produced, reproduced, and used inhalation devices of the period, a fact which is underlined by the sheer number and different styles of the inhaler present in the Wellcome Medical Collection housed in the Science Museum. Indeed, it is fair to describe the Nelson Inhaler as part of one of the \u2018unloved collections\u2019 in Blythe House: it is only one of a vast selection of inhalation devices that have not been regarded as suitable for display because of their technical focus or lack of aesthetic appeal. While steam inhalers were replaced in conventional respiratory medicine by modern inhalation devices (nebulizers, metered dose inhalers and dry powder inhalers) from the mid-twentieth century onwards, Dr Nelson\u2019s Inhaler is still produced today, but it is now more usually used by voice coaches.By reconstructing the \u2018biography\u2019 of the Nelson Inhaler, this article will attempt to sketch a network of medical and commercial interests and expertise in London which aligned in the 1860s to help establish inhalation as a popular, inexpensive and trusted form of medical therapy for respiratory and pulmonary ailments. By looking at what connects physicians, apothecaries, and patients \u2013\u00a0 the medicines and technologies that were prescribed, made, bought, and which caused wellness, side-effects, and even death \u2013 we can develop a narrative of illness as it was experienced by practitioners and patients alike. Pharmaceutical therapies \u2013 medicinal products procured from physicians, apothecaries, or commercial sources such as druggists \u2013 were the most common form of medical care among the working and middle-classes over the last three hundred years or so and any history of medicine using material objects needs to begin with these cures. Lung disease was a key issue in nineteenth-century discourse and here the smallest objects and seemingly simple technologies (pills, medicated steam, inhalation devices) enable powerful and provocative accounts of both the private and socio-historical dimensions of medicine. Through its widespread availability the Dr Nelson Inhaler allows us to develop multiple narratives of medical history and its omnipresence speaks to the question of self-medication and health consumerism in the nineteenth century. Its emergence from the orbit of the RMCS, on the other hand, can also help us to reconstruct a surprisingly thorough framework of what was, essentially, quality control, which was highly unusual for pharmaceutical technologies in the nineteenth century. As was occasionally the practice at the regular meetings of the RMCS, a certain Dr Nelson presented his prototype for a new therapeutic device which he had designed and developed himself, at the close of business on 28 May 1861. Unlike the in-depth research papers which were read out and discussed at the meetings (and later published in the Society\u2019s Proceedings and Transactions, including papers submitted by some of Europe\u2019s leading medical luminaries like Edward Jenner and Rudolf Virchow), such presentations of practical devices were recorded in short, perfunctory style and without much discussion. Dr Nelson presented an inhaler, \u2018its claims to notice being, great ease and simplicity of action; perfect cleanliness; and an arrangement of the mouthpiece by which is secured economy in the use of any medicated ingredient that may be required for inhalation\u2019 (Proceedings, 1861, p 399). The inhaler consisted of a small ceramic \u2018pot\u2019 with two protruding openings. The opening at the top of the device could be blocked with a cork into which a short metal tube was inserted to form a mouthpiece (in later versions glass was sometimes used); another spout-like outlet to the front remained open. According to directions in The Lancet, hot water was to be poured into the main body of the inhaler while the medication was to be soaked on a sponge inserted below the corked opening at the top. The patient would inhale through the mouthpiece, drawing in air from the second opening through the water and steam. This would potentially vaporise the medication on the sponge and deliver it to the lung.[2]\nBy 1865 Dr Nelson\u2019s device was being advertised widely in journals such as The Lancet (1865a, p 152), The Medical Times and Gazette (1865b, p 160) and later in the British Medical Journal (1870, p 674). Now christened \u2018Dr Nelson\u2019s Inhaler\u2019, this new inhalation device was produced and marketed by S. Maw &amp; Son from their London base in Aldersgate Street near the present-day Barbican (Maw\u2019s, 1866, p 82; Maw\u2019s, 1870, p 66). Maw\u2019s was a well-established surgical instrument provider, but they also sold less specialist medical products for the domestic market such as plasters, syringes and bandages. Following in the footsteps of pioneers like Mudge and Ramadge, the company had already begun advertising various inhalers in the early 1840s and later sold devices such as \u2018Startin\u2019s Pneumatic Inhaler\u2019 for the new chloroform and ether anaesthesia, making the company an ideal partner for inventors of new respiratory devices (Illustrated Catalogue, 2014, Vol. 2, p 125).\u00a0\nDr Nelson\u2019s Inhaler did not emerge into a vacuum in the mid-nineteenth century. John Mudge had invented a pewter inhaler in 1778 and seems to have been the first physician to use the word \u2018inhaler\u2019 in his related case histories (Mudge, 1778, p xi). Nelson\u2019s most immediate predecessor was Francis Ramadge, however. Ramadge developed an inhaler for treating tuberculosis and asthma which he made more widely known through his publication Consumption Curable in 1834 (Ramadge, 1834, pp 85\u201387). Born in Dublin and educated in Dublin and Oxford, Ramadge was senior physician and lecturer at the Central Infirmary in London, where he specialised in respiratory diseases. His inhaling pipe was a narrow tube made of wood or ivory through which the patient inhaled and exhaled. Initially it was about four feet long, but later designs were much shorter and included a whistle-type valve (Fitch, Six Lectures, pp 93\u201395). The narrow tube provided resistance to inspiration and expiration, and the therapy was designed primarily as a palliative \u2018mechanical\u2019 exercise to strengthen the lungs and expand the chest (Ramadge, 1834, p v). Interestingly, technologies are still employed today for respiratory muscle training in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cystic fibrosis using inspriatory/expiratory resistance devices (Volska et al, 2003; Battaglia et al, 2009; van Winden et al, 1998). While he acknowledged his indebtedness to experiments with inhalation by Ren\u00e9 Laennec (Ramadge, 1850, pp 9\u201312) and by Beddoes in Bristol (Ramadge, 1835, pp 109\u2013110), Ramadge was sceptical about the efficacy of inhaling medical preparations: \u2018As to medicated vapours [\u2026] upon the whole, I have found them to be either useless or injurious\u2019 (Ramadge, 1850, p 10; see also Ramadge, 1834, p 91). Notwithstanding these misgivings on inhaling medicinals, the version of the device advertised by Maw &amp; Sons in the 1860s shows Ramadge\u2019s pipe leading from a Mudge-type tin which would have been filled with hot water infused with pharmaceutical preparations similar to those used in conjunction with the Nelson\u2019s Inhaler (Maw, 1866, p 81). This would suggest that by the mid-nineteenth century both the mechanical and pharmaceutical uses of inhalation had become linked, even if Ramadge himself may have had little say in the design anymore (he died in 1867).\nThese technical innovations in inhalation therapy were not confined to Britain. In continental Europe considerable progress was being made in developing nebulizers, a more complex technology than the simple steam inhaler favoured by Mudge, Ramadge, and Nelson. In 1849 Auphon invented his \u2018atomizer\u2019 in Euzet-le-Bains, the point of origin of all further nebulising devices in the nineteenth century. His invention involved shooting a jet of medicated water at a metal plate, the resulting spray being inhaled by the patient. The models for this device were the inhalation rooms at spa resorts, where water would be jetted at the heated walls of an inhaling room, the pressure and heat producing a spray which was inhaled by walking around the room. In 1858 Jean Sales-Girons, well-known as the editor of the respected journal La revue m\u00e9dicale, introduced a portable version of this nebulising effect, using a small pump operated by the patient himself to generate the pressure required to produce the spray of medicated water which would be inhaled through a funnel-like mouthpiece (Sales-Girons, 1861, p 10). A similar device was developed and marketed by James Dewar in Scotland in the mid-1860s (Dewar, 1868, p 48). Dewar recommended a system of \u2018disinfecting\u2019 the nose, throat, and lungs with sulphuric acid (p 9). In Germany, in 1862, the Berlin lung specialist Louis Waldenburg acquired one of Sales-Girons\u2019 devices and adapted it with a design familiar from perfume sprays. He replaced the complicated and irregular pump in Sale-Girons\u2019 device with Mayer\u2019s uterus douche, which was to be operated by hand (Anon, 1862, p 330). In the same year in Berlin J Bergson, Georg Lewin\u2019s successor in the Inhalatorium at Berlin University, advertised his \u2018Hydrokonion\u2019 nebulizer on which he had been experimenting for some years (Bergson, 1862, p 389). His design replaced the hand-pump of previous nebulizers with two small tubes at right angles to each other, using a small foot-pump and the Bernoulli pressure principle to draw water up through one pipe and generate a spray with the other (Bergson, 1863, pp 66\u201367). In Stuttgart Emil Siegle developed a widely respected steam spray inhaler which used heat to generate the steam necessary for the Bernoulli principle, thereby rendering the hand-pump redundant (Siegle, 1864). His device consisted of a glass bulb filled with water from which one tube emerged to disperse the steam generated from by a small paraffin lamp at the base of the device. The medication was carried through a short tube from a second glass receptacle and was nebulised by the steam. The patient inhaled the medicinal steam through a small glass funnel (Siegle, 1864, p 25). Siegle\u2019s apparatus was manufactured and distributed in Britain by Krohne and Sesemann from 1871 onwards (Grossmann, 1994, pp 55\u201364; Anderson, 2005, pp 1139\u20131150; Sanders, 2007, pp 71\u201381) and although under patent (\u2018Announcement\u2019, 1864), it was quickly adapted by British physicians such as James Maxwell Adams in Glasgow (Adams, 1878). Siegle\u2019s patent officer in London, George Davies, clearly objected to the infringement and stopped Adams from marketing his inhalation device. Siegle for his part seems to have copied Adams\u2019 major innovations to improve his own device, adapting the boiler and replacing the glass components with more sturdy metal receptacles and face-guards (Adams, 1878, p 3). Owing to its Europe-wide success, Siegle\u2019s inhaler is generally held to be the first nebulizer in the proper sense.\nWhile the Dr Nelson\u2019s Inhaler appears somewhat old-fashioned by comparison with these nebulizers, it was in fact revolutionary at the time for its ease of use and patient-friendliness. It predated the availability of the Sales-Girons-type and Siegle-type nebulizers in Britain by some five years, and even after these other devices were available, the Nelson\u2019s Inhaler required a fraction of the maintenance necessary for the small technical parts in the nebulizers. Unlike these other devices, Dr Nelson\u2019s invention contained no complex tubing mechanisms to keep in working order and no sensitive components like glass which were prone to breaking and needed replacement. These factors made Nelson\u2019s Inhaler significantly cheaper. It was available for a relatively low price of between 4s and 5s 6d. By contrast the Ramadge Inhaler cost 16s (and required additional purchases of tubes, starting from 3s each), Mudge\u2019s Inhaler started at 8s (Maw Son &amp; Thompson, 1866, pp 81\u20132), and when the Siegle Inhaler emerged on the market in the 1870s it was sold by Krohne &amp; Sesemann for between 7s 6d and \u00a33 5s (Krohne, 1878, p 102).[3] The replacement parts for these nebulizers were pricey, costing between 1s 6d and 3s. In terms of cost and ease of purchase, Dr Nelson\u2019s Inhaler was significantly more customer-friendly. That said, given that average weekly earnings of labourers and artisans was 20s\u201330s in 1860s London, even the Dr Nelson\u2019s Inhaler would have been an exorbitant investment for the working classes. This suggests that the main consumer group for the inhaler were the aristocracy and the growing classes of professionals, clerks, civil servants, and army officers, who earned in the region of \u00a34\u2013\u00a35 a week, or \u00a3200\u2013\u00a3300 annually (Porter, 1998, p 176).The question of accessibility is no less important than affordability. Both Dewar\u2019s version of the Sales-Girons inhaler and Siegle\u2019s inhaler were initially only available for purchase from the instrument makers themselves (in Kirkcaldy and London respectively). From the outset the Dr Nelson\u2019s Inhaler could be purchased directly through pharmacies or by order from Maw &amp; Sons for use at home. This ease of access also had therapeutic reasons: Sales-Girons, Bergson, and Siegle all recommended using their devices under instruction in their clinics and inhalatoria, whereas the Nelson\u2019s Inhaler could be used under the instruction of a physician (e.g. in private practices or in hospitals) or procured for private use at home. This was in part because of safety aspects involved: early versions of the Siegle Inhaler were criticised for their dangerous unreliability. According to James Adams, the glass boiler was fragile and was prone to overflowing, potentially scalding the patient: \u2018the water flowing over through the stream escape is projected forcibly in the face of the patient\u2019 (1878, p 10). In Adam\u2019s opinion \u2018it required much persuasion on the part of the physician, and considerable nerve on the part of the patient, to face Siegle\u2019s Patent Inhaler after one or two experiences of this nature\u2019 (ibid). While steam inhalers such as Dr Nelson\u2019s device and nebulizers such as those patented by Siegle and Adams both used the same basic method (i.e. steam) to transport medicinal preparations, there was little danger of accidental scalding of this nature with the simple ceramic jug.\nAlongside cost and maintenance, the Dr Nelson\u2019s Inhaler required very little assembly; in fact, it could be used exactly as purchased. The mouthpiece remained attached to the cork, which would be removed to pour in hot water, and other than soaking the sponge with the medicinal preparation the patient needed to do very little to gain relief. There were also virtually no maintenance issues, other than occasionally replacing the sponge (any sponge would do) and washing out the ceramic pot. This may have been one reason why the Dr Nelson\u2019s Inhaler was popular among patients and practitioners. The medical substances for inhalation needed to be procured separately, and these included (according to the British Pharmacopoeia of 1867) hydrocyanic acid, chlorine, tincture of iodine, creosote, and hemlock. Other common preparations suggested in advertisements but not listed in the Pharmacopoeia included henbane, vinegar, and tincture of benzoin (e.g. Friar\u2019s Balsam), all of which were widely available as over-the-counter preparations from apothecaries, druggists, and other unofficial retails units.Literature, case histories, and personal accounts give little indication of how long each period of use would have lasted. However, Horace Dobell recommends that the water should not exceed 170 degrees when inhalation begins (Dobell, 1872, p 203), and William Abbotts Smith generally recommends three vapour inhalations per day, with each session lasting between 15 and 20 minutes (1869, pp 60\u201361, p 72). Other inhalers include detailed instructions according to which patients were initially recommended to undertake one daily session of five minutes\u2019 duration, rising to as many as ten daily sessions lasting up to fifteen minutes as the patient grew accustomed to the therapy (see Siegle, 1865, p 30). Repetitions of this duration will not have required much replenishment of hot water during each individual sitting with the Dr Nelson\u2019s Inhaler. Little is known about Dr Nelson and there may have been many professional reasons for this anonymity. One reason may have been the link in the public mind between inhalation therapy and quackery following a trial involving Dr Hunter (who claimed to have healed consumption through the inhalation of oxygen) and the Pall Mall Gazette in 1865\u201366 (Parry, 2000, pp 108\u2013109). This could well have made a respected physician reluctant to be identified with an inhaler he had invented regardless of how successful or effective it was held to be by his peers. There was clearly potential for reputational damage that could be incurred by having one\u2019s name associated in advertisements for inhalation devices or remedies, with the whiff of so-called quackery literally in the air. For example, in the first edition of his On Affections of the Throat and Lungs, Abbotts Smith included a preface distancing himself from Hunter\u2019s \u2018ignorant\u2019 and \u2018reckless\u2019 treatments (Abbotts Smith, 1869, p 6). Although quack medicine, as an outgrowth of the general industrialisation and commercialisation of medicine in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, was by no means the sole terrain of unqualified tradesmen (qualified physicians and apothecaries also engaged in commercial activities and the BMJ was an important site for advertising), professional physicians often based their superior status on the moral integrity of not advertising (Porter, 2000; Bartrip, 1995, pp 191\u2013204). Given the professional medico-scientific forum of the RMCS in which Nelson\u2019s inhaler was first presented, we can assume that the inventor\u2019s anonymity was in accordance with an unwritten code of ethics which held that the inventions of scientific and medical research should be made available for the benefit of the widest public possible (Gabriel, 2014). While the patent records for the nineteenth century in Britain are far from complete, it is telling that there appears to have been no patent taken out on the Dr Nelson\u2019s Inhaler and indeed the speed with which other producers advertised their own identical versions of the design (including, most notably, Boots towards the end of the nineteenth century) are evidence that there was no patent granted. The physician\u2019s interest in the greatest medical good over egocentric profit may well have been one reason for his passing over the design to Maw &amp; Sons to produce and market. Nevertheless, circumstantial evidence allows the possible inventors of Dr Nelson\u2019s Inhaler to be narrowed down to two candidates. Using the Medical Register, which was first published in 1859 and included the names, addresses, and qualifications of all licensed medical practitioners in the UK, 11 individuals with the surname \u2018Nelson\u2019 who were qualified prior to 1860 can be identified, of which two \u2013 David Hume Nelson of Birmingham (ca. 1812\u20131901, qualified 1848 in Edinburgh) and Thomas Andrew Nelson of London (ca. 1812\u20131894, qualified 1834 in Edinburgh) \u2013 are the most probable candidates.David Hume Nelson led a colourful and notable life. Born in Edinburgh, he moved to London around 1835, spent some time in prison for theft, returned to Edinburgh to qualify for his MD in 1848, before being elected physician at the Queen\u2019s Hospital in 1849 and joining the Faculty at The Queen\u2019s College in Birmingham shortly afterwards (Sanders and Harper, 2014). David Hume Nelson\u2019s qualifications in respiratory medicine are also well founded, having published his dissertation On the principles of health and disease in 1850 and featured in a series of case histories in the Provincial Medical and Surgical Journal (PMSJ, a forerunner to the BMJ) around 1850\u20131851 (Anon, 1850a; Anon, 1850b; Anon, 1851). As part of a \u2018strictly introductory\u2019 (Anon, 1850c, p 41) series of clinical lectures serialised in the PMSJ between 1851 and 1853 (also published in book form in 1850), David Nelson also gave three lectures on \u2018The morbid condition of the lungs and respiratory tubes\u2019 (Nelson, 1851, 1853a and 1853b). It is notable that inhalation is not mentioned as a form of treatment in any of these lectures, focusing instead on more traditional \u2018heroic\u2019 humoral cures such as blood-letting, cupping, leeches and the use of mercury, antimony, and oral expectorants. Following these early publications, David Hume Nelson seems to have turned his attention to other clinical matters, publishing a series of articles in the British Medical Journal between 1860 and 1863 on \u2018ferro-albuminous\u2019 treatments and peptic acids, all of which resulted from a ten-year clinical study in Birmingham into Bright\u2019s disease concluding in 1860 (Nelson, 1860a; Nelson 1860b). While David Hume Nelson was a renowned physician and indeed published results from his research \u2013 albeit on a completely unrelated topic to inhalation \u2013 in the issue of the BMJ immediately following the record of the RMCS meeting that mentions the presentation of the inhaler (Nelson, 1861, p 645), Thomas Andrew Nelson is virtually unknown. It is known that Thomas Andrew qualified in Edinburgh with a dissertation on \u2018Phthisis pulmonaris\u2019 in 1834 (and thus had specialised in a related topic; see Edinburgh Journal, 1834, p 490). He then relocated to London where he lived and worked in the area around Regent\u2019s Park, at first in Wimpole Street, then in Nottingham Terrace off York Gate.[4] Although he published few or possibly no writings whatsoever, Thomas Andrew Nelson was the only Nelson who held a Fellowship at the RMCS in the period in question, and his residence in an exclusive part of Marylebone is evidence that although we know little about him, his practice clearly thrived over a considerable period of time in the geographical area favoured by the Harley Street establishment.[5] Indeed, it is notable that highly respected physicians and experts in respiratory diseases and their treatment like Sir Charles Scudamore also lived in Wimpole Street and around York Gate in the period immediately following Thomas Nelson\u2019s relocation to London around 1835, suggesting a community of like-minded inhalation specialists within the RMCS and in close geographical proximity (the list of members includes addresses for Nelson, Scudamore, and other establishment physicians). The Proceedings make it difficult to establish the identity of the inventor with complete certainty: a Dr Nelson only appears twice in the minutes of the meetings in this period. Unlike external speakers or guests who are listed with their full names, titles, and affiliations, however, Dr Nelson is recorded without his first name, upholding the usual practice when referring to members of the Society. As Thomas Andrew was the only Nelson in the RMCS at this time, this could at least indicate his intellectual ownership. Thomas Andrew seems to have retired in 1890 or 1891 because his name disappears from the list of members several years before his death is recorded in the Marylebone parish records for the year 1894.[6]Although the inventor\u2019s identity remains somewhat uncertain, Dr Nelson\u2019s decision to work with Maw &amp; Sons is easier to reconstruct and understand. Not only was the company at the forefront of manufacturing and supplying medical equipment to hospitals and medical practitioners in Victorian Britain, they had themselves already marketed older ceramic inhalation devices and displayed these at the 1862 Exhibition. In 1835 Solomon Maw had taken over the company, originally founded by his father George Maw in 1814, from his elder brother John Hornby, and following Solomon\u2019s death in 1861 his son Charles ran the business in partnership with John Thompson (Anon, 1917, p 42). Maw &amp; Sons were particularly well suited to making ceramic instruments as one of George\u2019s sons, John Hornby Maw, had settled in Shropshire by 1850 and had set up a new business designing and manufacturing encaustic tiles, first in Worcester, then in Brosely, and finally Benthall (Herbert, 2005). With these family connections to the ceramics industry in Shropshire, and their own manufacturing and marketing expertise, S. Maw &amp; Son were an obvious partner for the inventor. The Dr Nelson Inhaler emerged into a medical market with a clear demand for reliable therapies for the various respiratory diseases blighting the towns and cities of industrial Europe. Rapid urban development had led not only to the spread of waterborne diseases like typhoid and cholera, but also to a peak in ailments like asthma and consumption, with fogs, smoke, and other pollutants a cause of almost constant suffering throughout the 1800s. In the Medical Times and Gazette the London Fog that killed 273 people as a result of bronchial complaints in 1873 was reported as \u2018one of the most disastrous this generation has known. To persons with cardiac and respiratory disease it has in numerous instances proved fatal\u2019 (Anon, 1873, p 697). Indeed it is telling that Maw\u2019s \u2013 one of the largest suppliers of medical and surgical instruments in Britain \u2013 displayed various patented inhalers at the International Exhibition of 1862 (Illustrated Catalogue, 2014, p 125), a reflection of the close and difficult relationship between Victorian industrialisation and medical innovation.Inhalation was becoming recognised as a quicker, less dangerous, less invasive, and pharmacologically more effective manner of medication for constitutionally weak consumptive patients. As indicated by the origins of inhalation therapies across Europe in spa resorts, the main forms of palliative therapy involved travelling to suitable locations such seaside baths and thermal baths, or even further afield to warmer climates (Waldenburg, 1864, p 2; Hassall, 1879), but this was unaffordable for all but the very affluent classes. More inexpensive forms of therapy included smoking stramonium and other substances, but although these provided relief, they were also known to have narcotic side-effects. Likewise, given that asthma was frequently held to be a nervous and/or spasmodic disorder, the ubiquitous opium was recommended as a relaxant in the form of pills or tinctures such as laudanum (Waldenburg, 1864, p 3; Thomson, 1866, p 37), but this was known to have significant side-effects such as constipation and addiction. Surgery was seldom considered suitable, and was concentrated on the upper respiratory tract with operations on the larynx or tonsils. Inhalation, by contrast, was growing more and more popular among physicians. In 1829, James Murray had already argued that \u2018bathing the lungs\u2019 ensured a more focused delivery, \u2018local affections [\u2026] which can be directed to and confined upon any point or part affected\u2019 is the preferred form of pharmaceutical therapy (Murray, 1829, p 168). Murray mentions Mudge\u2019s pewter inhaler as the impetus for the renaissance of the medical procedure of inhaling vapours in the mid-1800s, but he is also critical of the practice and technology of inhalation: \u2018It is needless to say that they [the inhaled vapours] do little good in the manner they are applied\u2019 (ibid). Five years later, Charles Scudamore praises inhalation for not affecting the stomach of respiratory patients in addition to their pulmonary distress (Scudamore, 1834, pp 136\u20137). When Dr Nelson emerged with his new double-valve inhaler in the early 1860s it was no surprise that one of the first advertisements for the device recommended the inhaler\u2019s simplicity (Anon, 1865b, p 160).By the mid-1860s medical journals and other publications were full of advertisements and announcements of new types of inhalers, hence it is not surprising to find Dr Nelson\u2019s Inhaler being advertised widely in journals such as The Lancet and the British Medical Journal in 1865. But professional colleagues like Abbotts Smith in his On Affections of the Throat and Lungs and their Treatment by the Inhalation of Gases and Medicated Vapours (1869, p 72) also recommended the device to their patients. Abbotts Smith also provides the theoretical background for the new-found popularity of inhalation therapy in the mid-nineteenth century. While stressing the impact of urbanisation and industrialisation with their economic and environmental factors, he points towards a paradigm change in drug delivery which seems to have started towards the end of the eighteenth century (Abbotts Smith, 1869, pp 16\u201319). While inhalations had been recommended in Egyptian, Indian, Greek and medieval treatises, most notably by Hippocrates and Maimonides,[7] Philip Stern\u2019s marketing of his own recipe of balsamic vapours in Medical Advice to the Consumptive and Asthmatic Peoples of England of 1764 marks the beginning of a process that led to Mudge\u2019s pewter inhaler. Stern was one of the first commercial scale producers of inhalers and inhalants and his \u2018pamphlet\u2019, which was aimed at the broader public, went through multiple editions; the price he seems to have paid for this popular focus was that he was shunned by the medical profession of the day and his work is largely unreferenced anywhere. Experimentation with oxygen and nitrous gases by Thomas Beddoes and Humphry Davy at the Pneumatic Institute in Bristol in the 1780s and 1790s confirmed the suitability of the lungs as a site for the absorption of medicinal products. Following Beddoes\u2019 lead, widespread experiments with oxygen and gas therapy in continental Europe, and France in particular (Lavoisier, Demarquay), showed a more widespread interest in the inhalation method around 1800. After training to administer foul-tasting medicines and invasive therapies like any other eighteenth-century physician, Beddoes noted \u2018the eagerness with which these patients looked forward for their dose of air\u2019 \u2013 the stimulus for a less invasive form of therapy was clearly motivated by these experiments (Beddoes, 1799, p 20; see also Jay, 2009; and Vickers, 2004). The publicity surrounding the Pneumatic Institute\u2019s experiments with nitrous oxide around 1798\u20131800 was also the impetus to wider experimentation with chloroform and laughing gas as anaesthetics on both sides of Atlantic in the 1830s and 1840s, with the successful experiments by James Young Simpson in Edinburgh confirming the ability to generate pharmacological effects through pulmonary drug delivery.This changing understanding of drug delivery was obviously of particular importance for physicians interested in respiratory illness. Scudamore introduced the findings of his clinical trials of inhalation in respiratory patients as follows: \u2018It constitutes a new method of treatment to administer by inhalation those medicinal agents which the science of modern pharmaceutical chemistry has brought to light; and it is my object [\u2026] to show that they are capable of exerting a very important and beneficial influence in certain states of pulmonary and bronchial disease\u2019 (Scudamore, 1830, p 2). Apart from programmatically highlighting the innovative nature of this therapy, Scudamore also points towards a changing understanding of pharmaceutical therapy to a more localised and directed form of drug delivery when he writes that the \u2018rationality of applying some remedial agent in a direct manner to the seat of the disease will not be questioned\u2019 (ibid). Similarly, Murray demands application of medicinals \u2018locally to the lungs\u2019, claiming \u2018if you inhale vapour, which condenses in the cells, at least a small part of it, it bedews and covers the surfaces and ulcerations\u2019 of the lungs, hence acting directly at the source of the irritation (Murray, 1829, p 173 and p 180). Alongside its appeal as a less physically invasive remedy, the practice of inhalation may therefore also be seen as part of a general trend towards targeted drug delivery and action emerging in mid-century Victorian Britain.As these empirical trials show, the inhalation device was used by hospitals for the poor, but its immediate target audience will have most likely been wealthy customers who could afford to purchase the inhaler and who could thus be encouraged to self-medicate. However, the economic means to buy proprietary medicines were not limited to very wealthy patients \u2013 the type of private patients Scudamore and Thomas Nelson will have seen around Marylebone \u2013 and the ease of access to the Nelson Inhaler and related medicines like Friar\u2019s Balsam suggest that less prosperous patients were also able to gain some relief from respiratory conditions. Such groups will have been more immediately affected by the environmental pollution of the industrial age than wealthy patients around Regent\u2019s Park, of course, and in acute cases those patients who were too poor to be able to self-medicate will also have had access to treatment by physicians like William Abbotts Smith who worked in Finsbury Dispensary and the Metropolitan Free Hospital, both in the immediate vicinity of Maw\u2019s base to the East of the City of London. Abbotts Smith refers to studies of patients with depositions of coal-dust in their lungs in the Sheffield area (1869, p 81) and to \u2018chimney-sweeps, bakers, and dock-labourers\u2019 (1869, pp 81\u201382). Indeed, he clearly drew on such patients as the clinical evidence base for his published writings, which contain various formulations which suggest that his therapeutic models are based on evidence he has gathered in the clinical environment. See, for example: \u2018Several of my patients [\u2026]\u2019 and \u2018cases have come under my notice\u2019 (Abbotts Smith, 1866, p 32); \u2018The inhalation of oxygen has been found very useful in preparing delicate patients for surgical operations, by restoring their vital powers [\u2026]\u2019 (Abbotts Smith, 1869, p 27); \u2018At this stage, the effects vary according to the individual\u2019 (ibid, p 48). In these publications, he also recommends the Nelson Inhaler unconditionally for hospitals and private patients alike:\nThere are numerous methods by which the patient may be enabled to inhale the steam, as, for instance, from a jug or basin containing hot water, or by breathing through a sponge which has been previously dipped in boiling water, and then partially wrung out. Several forms of apparatus have also been devised for this purpose; two of the most efficient of these, whether for the inhalation of simple steam or of medicated vapour, are Nelson\u2019s Inhaler and Sturt\u2019s Inhaler. (ibid, p 72)\nThe fact that a physician recommends the Nelson Inhaler here on the basis of empirical evidence from a clinical environment is quite a surprising finding in the broader context of nineteenth-century healthcare.Beginning with the initial presentation to the RMCS in 1861, and subsequently sanctioned in the Society\u2019s official publication, the Proceedings, the speed with which the Dr Nelson\u2019s Inhaler was recommended in the various media of the day is somewhat surprising. It is difficult to compare an inhaler to products such as pills, tinctures, and tonics, but these may provide a useful point of comparison. Concurrent developments in communication media, the expansion of the press landscape, and the speed of the postal network all assisted in the rise to fame and widespread use of preparations such as the laudanum brand \u2018Black Drop\u2019, tonics like \u2018Lydia Pinkham\u2019s Vegetable Compound\u2019, and later Burrough\u2019s and Wellcome\u2019s \u2018Tabloid\u2019 brand of pills, with their fully-fledged advertising campaigns. In mid-Victorian Britain, advertising was still considered the domain of \u2018quack\u2019 medicines, however. In an age in which some doctors were nevertheless far from media shy (Morell Mackenzie, as an ENT specialist and inventor of the so-called \u2018Eclectic Inhaler\u2019, notoriously courted media attention, not least during his treatment of the Prussian crown prince\u2019s throat cancer in the 1880s), the inventor of the Nelson\u2019s Inhaler seems to have had little pretention to public renown either for his device or for himself. A comparison to the other inhalation devices mentioned in this article shows just how unusual Dr Nelson\u2019s reticence was in this regard; Waldenburg (1862), Siegle (1864), Dewar (1868), Adams (1878), and indeed other physicians like Mackenzie, with his \u2018Eclectic Inhaler\u2019 (1880) all advertised their inventions with extensive user manuals and booklets, even if these were aimed either at professional colleagues or were distributed with the devices after they had been purchased. Dr Nelson\u2019s reticence to use his professional respectability more visibly could have been a hindrance to the inhaler\u2019s reception, despite his good connections in the medical community in either London or Birmingham. How should we understand the success of the device, then?The unusually speedy success seems to have been the result of widespread acceptance among colleagues, the commercial interests of Maw &amp; Sons, and finally the relative value for money already discussed above. For serious physicians or pharmacists, the sign of acceptance for a pharmaceutical preparation was its professional acceptance in the British Pharmacopoeia, the official sanctioned list of medication, rather than its popularity or profitability. For pharmaceutical technology the equivalent acceptance came in the form of recommendations in therapeutic handbooks, scientific studies, and its use in professional practice. This can be measured by the articles written by colleagues in specialist journals read primarily by other professionals and in more popular domestic handbooks in the final third of the nineteenth century. Readers of Spencer Thomson\u2019s revised Dictionary of Domestic Medicine and Household surgery in 1866, for example, will have found detailed notes \u2013 including two large illustrations \u2013 on the Dr Nelson\u2019s Inhaler (\u2018an apparatus for the inhalation of ether, chloroform, henbane, creosote, vinegar etc., in affections of the throat and bronchial tubes, asthma, consumption, etc.\u2019) in the relevant article on inhalers (Thomson, 1866, p 52). In a lecture published in the BMJ and subsequently republished in various regional medical journals across Britain and North America, the eminent Professor of Materia Medica and Medicine at King\u2019s College London, George Johnson, also spoke of having used the inhaler in advanced respiratory patients (Johnson, 1869, p 434). Finally, R Douglas Powell of the Brompton Hospital for Consumption and Diseases of the Chest, writing in The Lancet in 1877 recommends that inhalations \u2018may be taken very well from a deep jug or a Nelson\u2019s inhaler with the sponge removed\u2019 (Powell, 1877, p 152). Colleagues were recommending Dr Nelson\u2019s Inhaler on the basis of their experience in a clinical environment, a sign of esteem that may go some way to explaining the great success of the device in the period.Such professional acceptance took time, however, and certainly more than the short period between 1861 (when Dr Nelson\u2019s invention was announced) and 1865 (when it was first marketed) would have allowed. Here we must consider the role of Maw &amp; Sons, the original producers and marketers of the device. There was indeed a relatively robust advertising and marketing campaign surrounding the Dr Nelson\u2019s Inhaler in the 1860s and 70s across various media (from newspapers to professional journals), and this could have potentially brought the device close to accusations of commercial interests, and hence quackery. Since Dr Nelson had clearly forfeited his ownership of the device, however, these commercial interests were legitimate and didn\u2019t impact on the medical integrity of its inventor. From the outset, the advertising also made a point of avoiding the impression of aiming at a mass audience. The first announcement in The Lancet was targeted directly at \u2018medical men\u2019 (1865a, p 152) and subsequent advertising campaigns focused on journals such as the BMJ; advertisements in more popular newspapers towards the end of the century avoided any form of excessive rhetoric. Dr Nelson\u2019s Inhaler brought together professional dignity and acceptance, then, but also commercial know-how at an arm\u2019s length from the medical professional himself, and finally a competitive pricing structure, making the device affordable both for public clinics or hospitals and private patients alike. The combination of commercial and professional acceptance is perhaps the most notable feature of the Dr Nelson\u2019s Inhaler.Unusual in that it profited immensely from both professional and commercial networks of acceptance, marketing, distribution and use, the Dr Nelson\u2019s Inhaler enjoyed a remarkably speedy rise to fame in the medical marketplace of the 1860s and 1870s. Requiring only steam and cheap non-prescription medication, and readily available from multiple retail outlets \u2013 in hospitals and from personal physicians, by mail order catalogue, and from high street chemists or later even drug stores like Boots \u2013 the device was one of the most widely used inhalers in the nineteenth century. With its potential to take the treatment of respiratory illness out of hospital wards, physicians\u2019 clinics and spa resorts, the Dr Nelson\u2019s Inhaler offered a reliable form of self-medication against environmentally induced conditions such as bronchitis, catarrh, asthma, and more serious conditions such as the croup or consumption. Similarly, self-medication with the inhaler was connected with prophylactic treatment of respiratory conditions. Rather than allowing one\u2019s health to deteriorate, hence requiring costly treatment by physicians or in hospitals, many of the domestic handbooks and medical treatises point towards personal, preventative treatment in the comfort of the home. Spencer Thomson writes, for example: \u2018It is probable that the slow, imperceptible, but continual breathing of an atmosphere impregnated with such medicinal agents [\u2026] is more likely to be of service than their temporary use in more powerful doses\u2019 (1866, p 305). Abbotts Smith views inhalation as a form of breathing training, helping to manage the lung function (1866, p 70\u201371). The emphasis on individual management of respiratory conditions made possible by the Dr Nelson\u2019s Inhaler would later establish itself as a key component in the treatment of asthma patients from the mid-1950s onwards, as new pressurised metered dose inhalers (pMDIs) made self-treatment more reliable and effective (Anderson, 2005, p 1143\u20131144). Indeed, the instigator behind Riker and Du Pont\u2019s first pMDI in 1956, George Maison, explained that the origins of the project lay in his wish to simplify the treatment of his own asthmatic daughter, finding existing hand-held nebulizer devices unsuitable to outpatient use (see Grossmann, 1994, p 59). While the form of medication may have changed from medicated steam to bronchodilatory powders and steroids (Sanders, 2007, p 79), the \u2018cleanliness, portability, and cheapness\u2019 of the Dr Nelson\u2019s Inhaler mentioned in The Lancet (1865a, p 152) are qualities which are still central to inhalation devices today. Indeed, a recent regulatory-industrial collaborative workshop was devoted precisely to developing a patient-use focus in inhalation device design (Roche et al, 2017). Since the mid-twentieth century with Riker\u2019s pMDI and now especially in the twenty-first century, medical device development is returning to Dr Nelson\u2019s maxim of ease and simplicity of use.Of course, self-medication was by no means unproblematic in the nineteenth century and need not necessarily be considered an indicator of medical or pharmaceutical modernisation. Ineffective and even dangerous household remedies and patent medicines were frequently advertised and consumed in similar ways to the Dr Nelson\u2019s Inhaler, much to the distress and anger of the professional medical classes. A comparison with various other \u2018household\u2019 remedies for asthma and consumption in the second half of the nineteenth century confirms this. Alongside more reliable remedies and devices like \u2018Vapo-Cresolene\u2019 lamps, pillow inhalers, oxygen bars, asthma cigarettes and pipes (in ascending order of danger), we also find less serious remedies such as \u2018Sir Hiram Maxim\u2019s Pipe of Peace\u2019 (Sanders, 2007, p 77), the \u2018Carbolic Smoke Ball\u2019, which gained notoriety because of its role in a legal case which defined the limits of promises made in advertisements (Snell, 2001), and even Robert Moffatt\u2019s \u2018Ammoniaphone\u2019 (see Dickson, 2017). Given that the Dr Nelson\u2019s Inhaler was accepted in both commercial and professional terms, this was a form of self-medication for in- and outpatients that was medically legitimised. Moreover, it was sanctioned in more formal terms as a treatment method in academic publications such as case histories, medical textbooks, and more widely in domestic handbooks, while the incorporation of steam inhalations in the British Pharmacopoeia in 1867 placed the Dr Nelson\u2019s Inhaler at a remove from these irregular forms of treatment. Inhalation therapies in the second half of the nineteenth century typically involved either volatile or combustible materials for smoking or vaporisation (Sanders, 2007, p 79), including medicines of herbal origin such as stramonium, a direct link to modern antimuscarinic therapies. However, non-volatile, purified small molecular weight drugs began to emerge from the early twentieth century including adrenaline (extracted from adrenal glands; see Burnett, 1903) in 1903, atropine (purified from Hyoscyamus extracts; see Terray, 1909), ephedrine (structurally-related to adrenaline, purified from Ma Huang herb; see Chen and Schmid, 1924), and cortisone treatment by the 1950s (see Carryer, 1959). This required an evolution of device technologies to disperse bulk liquids into aerosol droplets that contained the dissolved (or suspended) drug, or to disperse ultra-fine bulk powders of the drug into inhalable aerosols under mechanical or aerodynamic forces. The result of this was the invention and development of the forerunners of modern inhalation devices including jet nebulizers (e.g. the Pneumostat, widely used from the 1930s but still generally housed in surgeries and pharmacies) or hand bulb nebulizers such as the Parke-Davis Glaseptic, and Abbots\u2019 Aerohaler (1948), which is clearly comparable to modern dry powder inhalers, and ultimately the pMDI in the 1950s (Sanders, 2007, p 79).While steam inhalers were replaced in conventional respiratory medicine by modern inhaler devices, Dr Nelson\u2019s Inhaler is notable for how it helped to establish inhalation as a popular, inexpensive and trusted form of medical therapy for respiratory ailments in the 1860s. In many ways, its inconspicuous ceramic form may well be one reason why it has survived in such numbers to be able to tell this story: unlike later low-cost devices from France and Britain which were made of enamel, the robustness of the Dr Nelson\u2019s Inhaler has helped it to survive in museum collections and antique shops to the present day. As such, the Dr Nelson\u2019s Inhaler can be seen as an important milestone in the development of modern outpatient treatment of asthma and other respiratory conditions. This was not least the case because of its affordability and flexibility, offering simple and reliable relief for respiratory and bronchial patients both in a clinical and a domestic environment. Its emergence from the orbit of the RMCS can also help us to reconstruct a surprisingly thorough framework of what was essentially quality control and professional recommendation, which was highly unusual for pharmaceutical technologies in the nineteenth century. The commercial interests of S. Maw &amp; Son ensured that the inhalation device was widely and successfully marketed and distributed without encroaching on the practices and disrepute of the patent medicine sector of the nineteenth-century medical market. As such the seemingly inconspicuous Dr Nelson\u2019s Inhaler enables us to tell a far-reaching story of pulmonary and respiratory disease and their treatment in the nineteenth century.\n\u00a0\nAcknowledgements\nThe research leading to these results was facilitated by the Andrew W Mellon Foundation in the form of a TORCH Knowledge Exchange Fellowship at the Science Museum London."},

The exhibition covers the work of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, the world\u2019s largest particle physics facility. Strategically, the subject matter had obvious appeal for the Science Museum, with its long term ambitions to tackle complex scientific topics, attract more adult visitors, and raise its international profile (Science Museum, 2012). Practically, creating an appealing exhibition around often abstract subject matter and unfamiliar objects was a curatorial challenge, and required an unusual approach.\nAudience research on previous LHC-themed exhibitions\u00a0at the Science Museum\u00a0and\u00a0CERN's visitor centre\u00a0gave some pointers (Hobson, 2012). To attract visitors in the first place, the Museum had to overcome intimidation around the subject matter: most visitors had heard of the LHC via media coverage, and were interested in finding out more about it, but many feared they would not be able to understand an exhibition.[1]\u00a0Alongside the non-specialists who make up the majority of Science Museum visitors, the exhibition was likely to attract people with a deeper interest in particle physics, so the Museum needed to create something novel for them. Visitors were interested in real objects from CERN, but these were unfamiliar and needed to be set in context; also, for obvious reasons, it was impossible to display the LHC\u2019s operational technology so the exhibition would have to rely on a relatively small number of prototype or spare components which could fit into a museum gallery. The main challenges were somehow to convey the extremes of the LHC\u2019s scale \u2013 large-scale engineering and the invisible microworld \u2013 and to answer a key visitor question: \u2018What\u2019s the point of doing all this?\u2019\nFrom an early stage in the development process, we decided that the exhibition would take the form of a \u2018visit to CERN\u2019. This was motivated by a number of research trips to the laboratory, and the experience of having the workings of the LHC explained repeatedly by a variety of physicists and engineers. It became clear that the combination of on-site visits and personal storytelling was an effective way of communicating complex material. In particular, the specialised objects around which the exhibition is built acquired new meaning and significance when set in their working environments and explained by the individuals who designed, built and operate them.\nIn creating our \u2018visit to CERN\u2019 we drew on insights from the three disciplines core to the Science Museum: historians\u2019 insights into the spaces of science; the first-hand experience of scientists; and museological techniques in recreating spaces to provide a three-dimensional visitor experience."},

This is an area where we are gradually discovering more, at a time when encouraging diversity in STEM is a key priority for the UK. The group of papers collected here (amongst further articles exploring key issues in the collections and practice of science museums) contribute to a wider understanding of those women who were able to work in science, technology, engineering and mathematics at a pivotal time: while it was more difficult for women to enter the STEM space, things were opening up, sometimes in unexpected ways. Let us start with the positives. From the late nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century, UK institutions were becoming more diverse. In this small selection of papers, we see the first women elected to the Institution of Electrical Engineers (now the IET) and the Institution of Naval Architects (now RINA). We also see research organisations such as the Burden Neurological Institute employing increasing numbers of women in technical roles. Other institutions were more reluctant to make use of women\u2019s labour in traditionally male roles, such as the railways, but women are visible in these spaces too, especially in wartime. The research detailed in these papers shows that women are appearing: in membership lists; in photographs; in family accounts; and in the archival record.However, gaps remain. The paper on the BNI describes how the women who were employed by the institution are either absent from the record, or present in problematic ways, marginalised and passive in photographs. Women are missing from the history of STEM: those of us who have conducted any research on early women scientists or engineers know the difficulty in finding any photographs, portraits, or official records. Research on the representation of women engineers in Wikipedia suggest that the digital arena does not necessarily redress the balance.The papers in this mini-collection draw attention to the gaps in research and help to locate and reinstate those missing women. However, we need to find more: in family collections perhaps, or in archives which need to be re-catalogued and researched to bring out new stories. New records are coming to light, and cultural institutions are committed to making their collections more diverse. The good news is that there is much interesting work ahead.\n"},

Sometimes called \u2018Spanish Flu\u2019, it killed an estimated fifty million people, infected ten times that number, and touched the entire globe\u2019s population. Thankfully, the statistics from COVID-19 look set to be a small fraction of that; but we too are realising that it will, somehow, affect everyone alive. Wellcome\u2019s international cultural project Contagious Cities (2018\u20132019) \u2013 a network of exhibitions, events and other outputs \u2013 was timed to mark the hundredth anniversary of a disease tragedy that is still remarkably under-recognised and discussed. While epidemiologists have long asserted that future epidemics were as good as inevitable, it has nevertheless been extraordinary, as well as frightening, to witness the project\u2019s core theme of epidemic preparedness get catapulted from the agendas of niche experts to become, for a while at least, the world\u2019s most vital topic.Humans inhabit cities, just as bacteria and viruses inhabit us. This intimate connectedness mostly plays out across a web of benign and managed co-dependencies. Sometimes deadly diseases emerge as predictable, if not inevitable, destructive consequences of that entanglement. At the core of our investigative initiative \u2013 one which placed special emphasis on juxtaposing insights for science and medicine with others from humanities and arts \u2013 were the hinged questions of how cities and diseases shape each other: how city life enables infections to spread but also to be understood and quelled; and how those histories leave their traces in the fabrics of cities.Contagious Cities was rooted in specific, local details of archive, fact, exhibit and story; but it also expanded across broader issues. Time and again, it showed \u2013 as COVID-19 is currently throwing into sharp relief again \u2013 how the best and worst of human behaviour can emerge simultaneously: how insight, innovation, compassion and hope are just as infectious as fear, despair, anger and hopelessness. And how all of these factors influence economic activity and confidence.In mid-nineteenth-century New York, for example, the prevalence of cholera in poorer neighbourhoods was vehemently held by some to be clear evidence of moral depravity, with the resulting deaths seen as a predictable and just consequence. But for others, it gave extra urgency to efforts at managing public health measures like the provision of fresh water and the removal of farm animals from the city, which eventually contributed to declining outbreaks of the disease. (See Germ City website.)\nDetails like these, and so many more disease episodes explored through each of Contagious Cities exhibitions and events, repeatedly revealed just how thoroughly medicine is intertwined with its social contexts in any given geography: how societies of all sorts desperately need science; but also, how much science relies on those diverse societies. Questions of language were also ubiquitous, surfacing, for example, in the all-too-tempting instinct to find a group somewhere to blame: \u2018Spanish Flu\u2019 (for the 1918 flu pandemic); the \u2018French\u2019 or \u2018Italian\u2019 or \u2018Christian Disease\u2019 (for syphilis); \u2018Gay Related Immune Deficiency\u2019 (for HIV/AIDS).At a deeper level, the project also exposed how much words and worldviews go hand in hand. Mariam Ghani, for example, one of the principal artists commissioned for the project, explored dominant metaphors for infectious illnesses through her film Dis-Ease. Stitching together a wealth of archival visual and narrative material, as well as institutional resources, Ghani\u2019s film builds a compelling meta-narrative of diseases that draws out noticeably dominant social fears and political assumptions.\nHer film (which she categorises as a \u2018creative documentary\u2019) focuses on how treatment of the sick has been influenced by the metaphors used to describe illness, which often conflate threats from bugs with those perceived from other people. Its chief weapon in that \u2018struggle\u2019 turns out to be terminology lifted straight from the battlefield to both: a \u2018war on disease\u2019, and on those imagined who carry it. Time and again, she shows how this has resulted in isolating and persecuting certain groups: immigrants quarantined on islands, for example, or neighbourhoods condemned through loose designations as \u2018hives of sickness\u2019.Another of the project\u2019s exhibition outputs, co-produced with the Museum f\u00fcr Naturkunde in Berlin, was cannily entitled Koexistenz. The word suggests a more complicated inter-relationship between humans, non-human animals and microbes, than the binary implications behind the dominant talk of eradication and submission: winning or losing wars. In tackling these immensely complicated (as well as fascinating) issues, multiple perspectives were vital. A key characteristic of the Contagious Cities project was the juxtaposition of contemporary and historical concerns; the blend of insights from a multitude of disciplines and perspectives; the balance of poetic and more didactic responses; and, as a thread weaving all of that together, the application of cultural practice."},

It is heartening to look back on the last five years and see how far we\u2019ve come. With over a hundred articles brought to an annual audience of around 25,000 readers, the numbers seem healthy. Dig deeper and we are living up to our ambitions of representing the broad interests of the Science Museum Group family while attracting authors from UK and international universities and museums. This issue, for instance, features authors from Russia and the USA, as well as Leeds, Oxford, Cardiff and Kent in the UK. Topics are also broad. You\u2019ll find object-focused research on a selection from the Science Museum\u2019s amulet collection, a discussion of the Crystal Palace dinosaur models, an evaluation of the use of a game to communicate the history of science to nurses, and a discussion of the importance of processions as a response to episodes of plague in sixteenth-century Italy, to name just a few. What am I most proud of over the last five years? Firstly, our ability to encourage promising new academics, represented in this issue by Jules Skotnes-Brown, winner of last year\u2019s writing prize, who presents a nuanced exploration of the 1924/25 British Empire Exhibition (itself a difficult idea for contemporary readers) by exploring the tensions between curatorial agendas and the sensorial experience of visitors. Secondly, I\u2019m pleased to see the Journal reflect the increasingly collaborative ways we conduct research within the group. The paper here on the conservation of a newly discovered eighteenth-century clock came out of a symposium called \u2018Sensing Time\u2019, held in partnership with the Victoria and Albert Museum, while three history of medicine papers emerged from a symposium entitled \u2018Wounded\u2019, which brought together academics whose work would help inform the Science Museum\u2019s new Medicine Galleries. There\u2019s always more to do, of course. I\u2019m currently asking myself how we can better reflect museum practice and present daily research which would normally appear as \u2018grey literature\u2019 while maintaining our peer review standards. How can we experiment with article formats, especially by exploiting our ability to show images, film and multi-media? How can we feature collections of articles in ways that the reader can easily identify and navigate through? All interesting terrain to explore: roll on the next five years.\n"},

This makes these topics relatively singular when presented in museums: all visitors will have lived experience of at least some of the items and issues on display. While this presents fantastic engagement opportunities for museums, it also poses challenges. First, there is the diversity of individual experiences that must be taken into account. In addition, given the deeply personal connections visitors can make with medical material culture and the themes this represents, it can also be triggering, eliciting strong emotional responses that traverse grief, fear, sadness and even wonder. So how can curators navigate this? This special issue of the Science Museum Group Journal on \u2018Curating Medicine\u2019 considers recent instances of this field of curatorial practice. The issue was produced to mark the 2019 opening of Medicine: The Wellcome Galleries, a major new exhibition suite at the Science Museum in London. It was principally conceived to capture the curatorial voices of those involved with recent medical curatorial projects, including the Science Museum\u2019s new galleries, on public record as well as to recognise the momentum this field of curatorial activity has gained in the last few years (see Parry, this issue). As such, it charts some instances of curating medicine from the perspectives of practitioners themselves, providing insights to the approaches they took and why, the challenges they faced and the strategies used to overcome them, as well as outlining avenues for future directions. In this way, the special issue responds to Science Museum Group Journal Editor Kate Steiner\u2019s reflections about how the journal, as a peer-reviewed publication, might \u2018better reflect museum practice and present daily research\u2019 and \u2018experiment with article formats\u2019 (Steiner, 2019). The inclusion of this kind of reflective writing is important for a journal in this context because, as the Science Museum Group\u2019s Head of Research, Tim Boon, highlights in a previous editorial, it can help museum professionals \u2018compare, understand, communicate and modify\u2019 their own practices, as well as provide opportunities for sharing work with colleagues in academia who have common interests, which might lead to productive research collaborations in the future (Boon, 2020). Such work therefore has the capacity not only to ensure the documentation of individual projects within institutional histories, but also to contribute to the evolution of curatorial practices and catalyse new directions in research.The projects and papers featured in this special issue stem from my time as Research Manager at the Science Museum between 2018\u20132020. A substantial part of my role was dedicated to developing and running the research programme that accompanied the Medicine galleries project and contributed to its legacy (Wade, 2019). Recognising the universal relevance of health and medicine as subjects, an interdisciplinary approach was central to the programme and a guiding principle was to provide opportunities for exchange between practitioners and academics so that knowledge, and the different ways this might be produced and communicated, could be shared in ways that I hope were mutually beneficial for all involved. Two of the major conferences that featured in the programme were Representing the Medical Body in 2019 (co-organised with Curator of Art Collections Katy Barrett) and Medicine: The Wellcome Galleries Conference in 2020, which celebrated the opening of the new exhibition suite. These events focused on artistic and curatorial practice respectively and included contributions from artists, curators, museum professionals and academics, who reflected on the specificities of displaying and representing health and medicine in art, exhibitions and museum collections. This special issue adopts this same thematic focus and approach, in part as a result of my own position as an art historian concerned with curating and visual cultures of museum display, but also to recognise that interest in health and medicine in contemporary art, exhibitions, museum display and related curatorial practices has been steadily increasing, thereby contextualising the arrival of the new galleries in this wider field (see, for instance, Alberti and Hallam, 2013; Arnold, Bencard et al, 2019; Barlow, 2020; Bencard, Whiteley and Thon, 2019; Hallam, 2016; Rodr\u00edguez-Mu\u00f1oz, 2020; Sandell, Dodd and Garland-Thompson, 2010).The special issue includes a paper in which the Science Museum\u2019s medicine curators discuss the development of Medicine: The Wellcome Galleries. The team offer a brief history of displaying medicine at the Science Museum and explain the conceptual frameworks that informed each of the new galleries. Ensuring people remained at the forefront of displays was an important consideration shared by all of the curators. The article describes some of the strategies used to achieve this, including participation projects, exhibition design decisions and the incorporation of contemporary artworks such as S\u00eean Davey\u2019s full-size photographic portraits of the individuals whose stories are presented on gallery.\nIt is notable that while the Medicine galleries project was in progress, other significant permanent displays about health and medicine were also underway elsewhere in the UK, including Wellcome Collection\u2019s Being Human, which opened in 2019, the Hunterian Museum\u2019s major renovation scheduled for completion in 2023, and the Vagina Museum, which moved to its first permanent site in 2019, representing a broader trend in this field of activity.\nIndeed, curator and historian of medicine Manon Parry recognises that it has been a generative time for medical collections and medicine museums across Europe. Parry charts recent developments in curating medicine through a selection of case studies and advocates for museums to embrace displaying \u2018risky\u2019 or hitherto unpopular subjects in order to engage diverse publics with their complexities. The article proposes some ways that medical collections might productively and experimentally address topics that have historically been identified as challenging, urging institutions to become more agile when tackling current issues and debates to secure their social relevance in the contemporary moment. Rapid Response Collecting is one strategy used by curators to respond to current events and ensure significant moments in the present are captured and represented in museum collections for the future. Adopted by the V&amp;A as a discrete strand of collecting activity in 2014,[1] the approach has quickly gained traction with many museums developing policies and projects pertaining to contemporary collecting. Curator Brenda Malone\u2019s contribution to this issue documents her work collecting the material culture of the Irish abortion referendum at the National Museum of Ireland in 2018. Malone outlines how she developed a schema for collecting this historic moment in the absence of an institutional strategy and introduces some of the objects that were collected. The project was a catalyst for subsequent contemporary collecting projects at the Museum, which resulted in the adoption of a Contemporary Collecting Policy in 2019, formalising this type of activity within the institution. Posters and banners formed a central focus of the referendum collecting activities and it is notable that many of these items were handmade, combining craft and activism in a \u2018craftivist\u2019 approach to campaigning (Greer, 2014). This references the long history of\u00a0of craft being used for social and political ends, from the embroidered banners created by suffragettes to the more recent AIDS memorial quilt (Newmeyer, 2008; Wolters, this issue). In fact, Malone presented this collecting project at the Science Museum\u2019s Material Culture of Health Activism workshop in 2019 and a significant part of this event was the Lotus Unfolding Ceremony of Block 3 of the Dutch AIDS Memorial Quilt, which had been recently acquired by the Science Museum.[2]As well as facilitating the ceremony, J\u00f6rn Wolters of Stichting NAMENproject Nederland presented a history of AIDS memorials at this same event. Wolters\u2019 paper has been expanded for this special issue into the Science Museum Group Journal\u2019s first photo essay, which visually documents AIDS memorials since the early 1980s, charting an evolution from informal projects to more formal, institutionally led approaches and making a case for their status as cultural heritage. AIDS memorials as cultural heritage, whether in the form of public art, monuments or events, offer another perspective from which the disease and its impact might be considered beyond the purely medical or scientific, providing possibilities for meaningful encounters with issues relating to health and medicine in the public realm and creating spaces where, significantly, the actual individuals who lost their lives to the disease can be represented and remembered.Wellcome: The Medicine Galleries includes four contemporary art commissions, expanding possibilities for the ways that health and medicine might be encountered and experienced by visitors on gallery. Curator of Art Collections Katy Barrett reflects on the process behind these commissions and interviews three of the artists about their experiences of proposing and realising their projects. The presentation of contemporary art in non-art museums has been a vibrant field of curatorial activity since the 1990s, receiving increasing academic attention over the last decade, primarily in relation to its display in collections of anthropology, natural history, science and social history (Arends, 2009 and 2019; Carroll La, 2011; Redler Hawes, 2010; Robins, 2013; Rossi-Linnemann and de Martini, 2019; Wade, 2020). Barrett raises the question of what art can contribute in the context of medical museum displays specifically.[3]Staying with the topic of contemporary art and medicine, curator George Vasey examines Misbehaving Bodies: Jo Spence and Oreet Ashery, an exhibition at Wellcome Collection in 2019\u20132020, which he co-curated with B\u00e1rbara Rodr\u00edguez Mu\u00f1oz. Vasey reflects on the curatorial strategies used to create a safe and supportive community space in which visitors could engage with artworks about illness and dying as well as encounter multiple perspectives on these subjects. Vasey\u2019s essay also raises the issue of the wellbeing of staff involved in developing exhibition projects about health and medicine, making a case for the provision of support for staff being embedded in institutional practices. While the absence of COVID-19 related articles appears like somewhat of an oversight in a medical themed issue being published in the midst of the pandemic, the opening of the Medicine: The Wellcome Galleries and the completion of the accompanying research programme occurred before the world entered this unprecedented moment in recent history.[4] Nevertheless, Ken Arnold and Danielle Olsen\u2019s contribution discusses the Wellcome\u2019s cultural project Contagious Cities (2018\u20132019), which explored how populations across the world have responded to and prepared for epidemics. Interdisciplinary in approach, the project placed emphasis on artist\u2019s projects and international collaboration. Here, the authors reflect on what they learned about co-creating during this project and consider how Wellcome\u2019s institutional authority impacted this work in advance of embarking their next international cultural project, which focuses on another important global issue: mental health.Collaborative approaches to curating and exhibition making are a feature of all of the contributions in this special issue. Participation and co-curation projects are becoming more embedded in museums as they seek to become more inclusive, relevant and welcoming places that reflect the reality of the communities that surround them.[5] Yet these approaches seem particularly well-suited to developing exhibitions about health and medicine, given the personal nature of the relationships people forge with these topics and the multiplicity of experiences amongst patients, practitioners and museum visitors. In this context, collaborative curatorial methodologies provide opportunities for the development of multi-faceted and multi-authored exhibitions that none of the contributors could have realised by working on their own. This way of working offers possibilities for combining personal experiences with medical histories and material cultures, artistic, clinical and scientific knowledge in ways that are as much emotive as they are informative to create spaces and circumstances for meaningful discussions, encounters and experiences amongst museums\u2019 wide ranging stakeholders and visitors."},

Ideas around sound and vision are not only of interest to the Science Museum Group generally, but very specifically to its site in Bradford, and as the Director of the (newly named) National Science and Media Museum I am delighted to be introducing this issue.\u00a0 Both the photography and the sound themes come from continuing research on collections across SMG and demonstrate the huge opportunities that exist for our Museum in Bradford to provide a platform to explore the science and culture of image and sound technologies. Several of the articles in this issue also explore the theme in the context of museum practice \u2013 whether that be the challenges of displaying acoustic collections in a public space, to an examination of a temporary exhibition on Noise Abatement at the Science Museum in 1935. It therefore seemed ideal to publish this special issue to mark the renaming of the Bradford museum, with its refocus on STEM, along with a new brand, a new website and a spectacular new interactive gallery \u2013 Wonderlab \u2013 that will enable visitors to explore the scientific principles of light, sound and perception, the science that is directly relevant to our core collections.Every cultural institution should continually reflect on its purpose and the changing context and landscape in which it operates. We should always be seeking to maximise areas of opportunity and growth, while remaining relevant and meaningful to visitors. But a change of focus is a significant shift and the changes at the National Science and Media Museum have inevitably raised debate. Three of the papers in this edition reference some of the strong feelings that have been engendered by the decisions taken by the Science Museum Group, specifically around the relocation of a key photography collection (See Edwards, Burbridge, and Terwey). These papers explore this complex and nuanced situation, from within and outside the Museum and provide an opportunity to reflect on what the changes mean to the wider research community and publics. Collections are at the heart of every museum and a museum frames its collections through its curatorial interest and focus. As Elizabeth Edwards discusses in her article, the framing of objects by institutions can influence how they are perceived and understood. But while change might mean we stop exploring one area, it also creates new spaces for different thinking and research. Publication of these papers demonstrates the essential role of scholarly debate in balancing the heated press and individual response. I believe they provide a much needed detailed and considered analysis of recent circumstances and help illuminate the complexities within it that perhaps were not evident in the heat of the press coverage.Museum activity is a complex combination of collections and expertise, audience and locale \u2013 these all develop and change over time. It has previously been noted that one of the purposes of this journal is to foster informed debate, particularly about the impact of science and technology on our social, economic, political and cultural lives. I would add that an equally interesting discussion is the role of the museum and institutional practice in the way that science and technology, indeed all culture, is understood and appreciated.\nJo Quinton-Tulloch, Director of the National Science and Media Museum\n"},

One thinks, perhaps, of Italian Renaissance painter Antonello da Messina\u2019s \u2018St Jerome in His Study\u2019.\nIt would follow that a pandemic year, closing museums, libraries and archives, and sending researchers to their solitary workstations would be most conducive to the productivity of researchers and those that work with them, such as the members of the Science Museum Group Research Department. The reality that we all experienced was not so gentle. Museum staff were furloughed and projects postponed; academic authors and reviewers wrestled with dislocation from their colleagues, workspaces and libraries, and faced the need to create instant online courses for students, and all were burdened by worries about vulnerable friends and family, and a frightening world situation. Yet, in many ways the pandemic year has been a highly productive one, despite the circumstances. This issue of the Journal is evidence of that productivity and stands as a testament to the resilience of all involved: this Spring issue catches us up to our normal cycle of publication after the slightly delayed appearance of Issue 14. It includes a collection of three papers associated with the Science Museum\u2019s new permanent Science City gallery, six other research articles and an obituary of former director, Dame Margaret Weston. We can be satisfied that despite us all working from home over more than a year, the interest, diversity and volume of the Journal\u2019s content is not dulled an iota.Behind the scenes too, the Department has been going about its business: we have inducted one cohort of collaborative doctoral students under our AHRC-funded Collaborative Doctoral Partnership, and selected the next group of studentships, just now being advertised. We taught our \u2018Curating Science and Technology\u2019 MSc option for UCL Science and Technology Studies, although entirely online and without access to the objects and galleries that are the normal focus of our teaching. And we have composed several research funding bids, working with a wide variety of partners. Some projects, envisaged and commenced as involving major in-person activities, have moved \u2013 and even been completed \u2013 online. Others have been awarded in this last year, with their investigators starting entirely online but very much looking forward to the museums opening and being able to meet again. We hope and expect that future issues of the Journal will feature outcomes from these projects. It is the social side of research that has been missing. We have learned to conduct our seminars, workshops and conferences online \u2013 indeed, we hosted two major online conferences (with the Scientific Instrument Commission in September, and the Sound Instruments and Sonic Cultures conference, hosted by the Science and Media Museum, in December). Surely, some of this online practice will remain when we return to the workplace, not least for the greater inclusivity of conferences that do not entail expensive travel. But research, ineluctably, has a social aspect. Conferences are more than the performance and witnessing of research reports; they are the opportunity for extended discussion and the development of new ideas. Publishing involves the spontaneous social discussion of a submitted paper, the gathering-round a layout or the sharing of an editorial board meeting. Teaching in the museum benefits from the kinaesthetic appreciation of museum spaces, the presence of historic objects and the direct interaction of the seminar room. Grant-composition generally involves coffee-fuelled meetings where joint ideas are conceived between people bringing differing skills and interests; diagrams are often drawn. We have learned much from working in isolation, but living research needs social contact. We look forward to our return."},

With the launch of this journal we hope to change that. We are proud of our growing body of research and here we will freely share it, but we also invite original work from others working in museums and universities across the world, knowing that new thinking, discussion and debate will nudge us all into greater creativity.\nAcademic publishing is going through a period of extraordinary change and its future is somewhat uncertain, but the Science Museum Group Journal takes advantage of being born in a digital age, with all the opportunities that this offers.

It was established in the 1970s as part of an agreement to acquire, on permanent loan, the collection of Edwardian pharmaceutical magnate Sir Henry Wellcome. When the transfer was completed in 1976, it effectively doubled the size of the Museum\u2019s collections overnight. Wellcome\u2019s extraordinarily prolific and sweeping collecting was informed by the ideals of late nineteenth-century evolutionary anthropology. Advocates of the so-called comparative method, epitomised by Victorian ethnologist General Augustus Pitt Rivers, amassed huge numbers of near-identical items in an effort to establish the origins of cultural practices (Skinner, 1986). By the time he died in 1936, Wellcome had accumulated over a million objects \u2013 around fifty times as many as Pitt Rivers had bequeathed to Oxford University half a century earlier. Yet his ambition to create an all-encompassing \u2018Museum of Man\u2019 to \u2018illustrat[e] the development of the art and science of healing throughout the ages\u2019 remained unfulfilled.[2] Many of the items he purchased at auction or had shipped back to London (via a team of agents posted across the globe) were never even unpacked in his lifetime. A fraction made it onto the gallery floor of his appointment-only Historical Medical Museum on Wigmore Street, which opened in 1913. The Museum began its move into the Wellcome Building at 183 Euston Road \u2013 now home to Wellcome Collection, the public venue \u2013 in the 1930s, before being forced into storage by the Second World War and the subsequent relocation of Wellcome\u2019s pharmaceutical business to that building. The Historical Medical Museum began to be reassembled onsite in 1954 where it remained (in a reduced form) until the late 1970s, when the object collection was transferred to the Science Museum.[3]\nWellcome struggled to define where medicine ended and life began, amassing everything from infant feeding bottles to entire rooms full of weapons. Despite having been extensively rationalised in the years following his death, his museum collection still comprised some 114,000 objects when it entered the Science Museum. There were similarities between the two institutions \u2013 the collecting policies of both, for one, owed much to the Darwinian evolutionary model. However, whereas Wellcome had been concerned primarily with origins, the Science Museum \u2018use[d] the past to illuminate the present and future\u2019 (Bud, 2010: 250). Anthropology fell outside the latter\u2019s established interests, which had, in the words of the Museum\u2019s former Medicine Curator Robert Bud, embraced \u2018a philosophy of celebrating the importance of science through its practical applications [and] laboratory achievements\u2019 (Bud, 2010: 253). In an effort to bring the collection up to date, our curators undertook a flurry of collecting activity in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Examples of twentieth-century medical technology took precedence, in line with established Science Museum's collecting strategy. It is fair to say that much of the material collected during this period reflected recent medical history from the perspective of scientists and practitioners rather than patients. Within a decade of acquiring Sir Henry Wellcome\u2019s Museum Collection, the Science Museum had launched two new galleries to showcase it. For the first time in the collection\u2019s history, a deliberate attempt was made to create displays for the general, as well as the more specialised visitor. Glimpses of Medical History opened in 1980 and was comprised exclusively of dioramas and room sets (many featuring objects from the collection) designed to \u2018help the visitor to gain an insight into how it might have felt to be a doctor or patient at other times in history or in other cultures\u2019 (Bracegirdle, 1981: 1).\nA year later came The Science and Art of Medicine, which ambitiously attempted to present a chronological history of medicine from antiquity to the modern age. It incorporated some 5,000 objects, in a quarter of the space assigned to the 2019 galleries.\nBefore long, curators began discussing what new medical exhibits could achieve that the early eighties galleries could not. This was partly born out of a desire to display more of the collection \u2013 particularly newly acquired material \u2013 and give greater prominence to themes that had received only cursory attention in the near-encyclopaedic approach evidenced by Science and Art of Medicine. Curators were also influenced by new scholarship in the history and sociology of medicine which emphasised patients\u2019 experiences (see, for example, Armstrong, 1984; Porter, 1985). A series of plans for new displays were developed during the late eighties and early nineties, before Health Matters (1994) got the go-ahead. This gallery sought to combine social history and science studies approaches to create a vivid portrait of twentieth-century medicine that made extensive use of archive films and dramatic object juxtapositions to appeal to general museum visitors and to bring patients into the picture (Boon, 1999). These spaces \u2013 Glimpses of Medical History, The Science and Art of Medicine, and Health Matters \u2013 were the Science Museum\u2019s major statements on medical history when conversations began about the creation of a new generation of displays a decade ago. This time the galleries would be placed at the heart of the Museum\u2019s buildings, rather than being tucked away on the fourth and fifth floors."},

Creating the Cosmonauts exhibition has been a complex and demanding undertaking, one that raises a number of key questions that are at once historical, political and ethical. There is no doubt that the string of firsts obtained by the Russian space programme is of world historical significance. It is of such great significance that we can see the central role relics have played in perpetuating the memory of the people (and animals) who ventured into space. Objects and images enable audiences not only to learn about science, but also to form emotional attachments, which are orchestrated by the ensemble of elements \u2013 light, colour, sound, labels and panels, spatial arrangement and constituent artefacts \u2013 of which an exhibition is composed.\nThe Science Museum Group is necessarily concerned with the past of science, medicine and technology, as well as their present and future. Presenting that past fully, openly and honestly is central to its mission. So too is reflecting critically on how it performs its principal functions. The Cold War, the immediate context for the so-called space race, is in living memory for many people, while subsequent events have keep alive complex reactions to the dynamics between the world\u2019s most powerful nations, and these will inevitably inflect the reception of Cosmonauts. All these issues merit serious discussion. One of the main purposes of this Journal is to foster informed debate and especially to encourage calm, reflective assessment of the changes that science, medicine and technology have brought with them, above all by showing how intricately they are woven into the fabric of our social, economic, cultural and political lives. It also exists to foster lively conversation about the ways such change may be represented in a responsible manner.\nFurthermore, there are ethical obligations to consider here. They make it incumbent on those who earn their living by documenting, analysing and displaying science to engage with intricate and difficult issues no matter how uncomfortable it may be for them and their audiences. There is no shortage of such issues, which include climate change, chemical warfare, genetic modification \u2013 whether of crops or embryos \u2013 and the impact of digital technologies. This Journal then, is an integral part of the Science Museum Group\u2019s activities, since it provides the occasion for serious, informed reflection on human change, no matter what form it takes. And I can invoke \u2018human change\u2019 in a broad sense since science, medicine and technology lie at the very core of our history."},

Museum research not only reflects the collections and interests of the organisation, it also exposes changing societal concerns and the pressures placed on museums. Thus museum research gathers knowledge for the benefit of museum displays and audiences, whilst providing a lens through which we can reflect on the role museums play for us, how they communicate what is important to us, and the social values they might promote in the future. The research in this edition of the Science Museum Group Journal reflects this variety of interests, highlighting the wide range of enquiry encompassed by the broader Science Museum Group community. This edition of the Science Museum Group Journal includes work from one of our PhD students on the conservation of doped fabric-covered aircraft, a commentary on current debates in science communication, and a reflection on the historiography of a core audience-facing Science Museum staff role \u2013 the explainer or demonstrator. The latter discussion could not come at a more appropriate time, as we recently opened our new interactive gallery, Wonderlab: The Statoil Gallery, filled with explainers and the bold goal to welcome over 200,000 school children every year.Just as the Science Museum Group has a continued commitment to create the world\u2019s foremost assemblage of the material culture of science and technology, so our future research commitment invites a broad and international community of museum professionals, university scholars and students to collaborate with us to build research activity, open up creativity and broaden knowledge across sciences, arts and the humanities. As Head of Collections at the Science Museum, it is my ambition that we continue to grow our research programme, building on a duty and a passion to explore the way that scientific practice and artefacts are embedded in our history and culture.Tilly Blyth, Head of Collections"},

I would like to use this editorial to discuss the generous scholarship that characterises the workings of this journal.In his editorial in Issue 1, the Director of the Science Museum Group (SMG), Ian Blatchford explained the purpose of the SMGJ as follows:\nWe are proud of our growing body of research and here we will freely share it, but we also invite original work from others working in museums and universities across the world, knowing that new thinking, discussion and debate will nudge us all into greater creativity.\nThe Science Museum Group Journal (SMGJ) is an open-access forum that publishes, electronically, peer-reviewed contributions from scholars whose work is related to the collections and practices of the international science museum community. Authors get no remuneration for their papers and the Journal\u2019s relatively new appearance on the block means that they won\u2019t get much academic credit either in places where Impact Factors and citations count for promotion and status. Likewise, the peer reviewers and the editorial board, which I have the pleasure of chairing. And yet the SMGJ is thriving \u2013 the number of readers continues to rise, high quality contributions come in from around the world and the original aim, to provide \u2018an innovative voice in discussions worldwide about science and its history, material culture, communication, display and presentation in museums\u2019 is increasingly being realised. This generosity of scholarship in the current academic climate would not be possible without the equally generous support from the SMG.So, where next? Generous scholarship also involves building on ideas and collaborating. SMGJ will seek to encourage papers from collaborations in the field. We also aim to diversify our engagement with readers beyond the usual words and pictures. We hope to include more links to sound archives and use the immersive 3D photography technology. We also hope to experiment with more interactive dialogue and discussion. The Journal is open to ideas and encourages generous scholarship from its readership. We seek new thinking, discussion and debate which we know \u2018will nudge us all into greater creativity\u2019.\n"},

The reader must make a decision whether to risk diminished pleasure from knowing the denouement as they set out to read or watch the artwork in question. I was reflecting on this convention as it applies to museums: I have yet to see any critic give a \u2018spoiler alert\u2019 in an exhibition review, even though most displays these days are narrative in conception. Would it affect the experience of any visitor to our Cosmonauts exhibition, for example, to know in advance that its final room, containing an atmospheric installation featuring a tissue equivalent mannequin modelled on Yuri Gagarin, echoes the exhibition\u2019s opening section on the early twentieth century Russian philosophy of Cosmism? Probably not; in fact, many museum professionals, when visiting another venue, will deliberately reconnoitre an exhibition to grasp its structure before attending to specific objects and displays. For them, even a narrative exhibition is better understood if one knows what is coming. I even know a thriller-writer who always reads the ends of books to decide whether it is worth reading them in detail.\nNo such uncertainties about the virtues of prior exposure dog the consumption of periodicals; academic writing presupposes analytical and selective reading. Indeed, this issue of the Science Museum Group Journal anticipates \u2018Science Museums and Research\u2019, the inaugural conference we are holding in our new Dana Research Centre and Library the weekend after Easter. Half of this issue\u2019s substantial contributions amount to pre-circulated versions of material to be presented at the conference. It is now not unusual for workshop organisers to insist on pre-circulated papers, so as to ensure lively and informed discussion, and this is our aim here too. Ken Arnold\u2019s reflections on exhibition-visiting as a kind of research, or Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Gauvin\u2019s critique of conventions in scientific instrument display, for example, are discussion pieces. As regular readers will have noted, this is one of our standard genres of article. Only this time, we have a forum where that discussion can take place. \u2018Science Museums and Research\u2019, over three days, gives an opportunity for the Science Museum Group\u2019s research community to convene: Our staff, students and our close associates in the universities will be presenting and discussing the actuality and potential of research of all kinds in the work of the museums. More than fifty speakers, covering the material and public cultures of science and technology, as well as their interrelations with the arts, will demonstrate the myriad ways in which research can fertilise all aspects of our museums\u2019 work. For those of you unable to attend, we expect a fair number of the presentations to appear in written form in future issues of SMGJ.

Completed in 1923 as the first locomotive of the newly formed London &amp; North Eastern Railway (LNER), Flying Scotsman has, since 2004, been part of the National Railway Museum\u2019s collection. An initial analysis would lead one to question why this particular locomotive enjoys a profile unlike any other. Flying Scotsman is not revolutionary in the way that George and Robert Stephenson\u2019s Rocket was, nor is it the largest, most powerful or fastest steam locomotive \u2013 all features that could be assumed to provide a unique significance. Indeed, Flying Scotsman itself was not even unique as an example of engineering excellence, being one of a class of some 79 such locomotives (Flying Scotsman was built to Sir Nigel Gresley\u2019s A1 design but was rebuilt to his improved A3 design in 1947). Nor was Flying Scotsman the first of its class (it was the third to be constructed), and while it held for a short time the world steam speed record (set in November 1934) this was soon beaten (in March 1935) by a sister locomotive Papyrus. Yet Papyrus was scrapped without protest while Flying Scotsman has a well-founded claim today to be the most famous steam locomotive in the world.[2] The reasons for this are varied and complex \u2013 there was no certainty that Flying Scotsman would survive to become the cultural icon it is today. Passed over for preservation in the early 1960s, the locomotive was earmarked to be scrapped. That it wasn\u2019t and instead has gone on to become arguably the most recognised railway locomotive ever raises questions as to how we view our past and what it is that makes objects \u2013 large or small \u2013 significant to museum curators, enthusiasts, and the wider public. The rescue and restoration of Flying Scotsman in 1963 and its subsequent operation unquestionably increased its fame. In 1966 the locomotive was hailed by John Noakes as \u2018the most famous steam locomotive in the World!\u2019 on the BBC\u2019s flagship children\u2019s television programme Blue Peter.[3] Noakes\u2019s feature was in response to the programme receiving \u2018lots of letters\u2019 from children distraught at the withdrawal and scrapping of steam locomotives. This was an era when Britain was emerging from post-war austerity into a world without Empire and a time where it has been argued that a wistful nostalgia for the past took root, enhancing, in turn, the power of symbols of past ages (Cannadine, 2002). On Blue Peter \u2013 then watched by an astonishing seven million viewers \u2013 Flying Scotsman became a symbol for a vanishing way of life.[4]Prior to preservation Flying Scotsman had enjoyed periods of great fame so its profile was not solely a product of the 1960s. The foundations of the locomotive\u2019s celebrity in the 1920s and 1930s owes itself to a number of factors, some deliberate, others accidental. The key first point stems from the misunderstanding surrounding the \u2018Flying Scotsman\u2019 name and popular confusion about the differences between a locomotive and a train. This confusion played into the hands of Flying Scotsman, which was deliberately named by the LNER after a long established train of the same name. The \u2018Flying Scotsman\u2019 had for long been the unofficial name of the flagship service on the east coast main line connecting London to Edinburgh. In fact, it was not one train but two with simultaneous departures traditionally leaving the respective capitals at 10am each weekday. The train quickly established a reputation for speed and was known from at least 1864 as the \u2018Flying Scotchman\u2019 due, as the Oxford Times explained, to \u2018the rate at which it travels\u2019 (The Oxford Times, 1864). Such popularity manifested itself in other ways too: as early as the 1880s the service gave its name to the popular \u2018Flying Scotchman\u2019 pen which, its makers boasted, \u2018glides like an Express Train\u2019.[5]The \u2018Flying Scotchman\u2019 became popular with businessmen, soldiers, politicians and diplomats. There are, for example, two known instances of the celebrated novelist Charles Dickens travelling on it (Dolby, 1912).[6] In 1897 it even became the subject of an article sitting alongside the latest Sherlock Holmes instalment, \u2018The Adventure of the Speckled Band\u2019, in The Strand Magazine (then enjoying a circulation of around 500,000) (Kitton, 1892). The train\u2019s fame was justified as the southbound service opened up the London markets and helped cement Edinburgh\u2019s role as a major financial centre; the northbound service gave access to Scotland as a tourism destination, a land recently popularised by Queen Victoria and the novels of Sir Walter Scott (it was no co-incidence that the \u2018Flying Scotsman\u2019 arrived into Edinburgh\u2019s Waverley Station, which took its name from Scott\u2019s most successful novel). Scotland\u2019s increasing popularity as a leisure and tourism destination owed much to the popularity of this train. Therefore, when the LNER named Flying Scotsman in time for her appearance at the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley in 1924, the name was already well known.\nThis was an inspired act of marketing by the still fledgling LNER \u2013 it could both showcase its latest and most powerful locomotive type whilst simultaneously advertising the company\u2019s flagship service. The exhibition attracted a huge audience and enjoyed worldwide press coverage with Flying Scotsman a star exhibit. By 1928 the \u2018Flying Scotsman\u2019 service was being advertised as \u2018The Most Famous Train in the World\u2019 and the eponymous locomotive was being used to publicise the company and its service.[7] In May 1928 the locomotive hauled the first non-stop run of the northbound \u2018Flying Scotsman\u2019 amid much media fanfare; the following year saw the locomotive and train star in one of the earliest British talkie movies (appropriately named The Flying Scotsman) (McLean, 2016). Later publicity photographs would be taken of the locomotive and its regular crew of driver William Sparshatt and Fireman Webster shaking hands variously with Sir Malcolm Campbell and Geoffrey de Havilland, respectively the fastest men on land and in the air. On 30 November 1934, Sparshatt and Webster took Flying Scotsman on the world\u2019s first authenticated 100mph run by a steam locomotive, thus becoming the fastest men on rails (McLean, 2016).Speed, for long associated with the \u2018Flying Scotsman\u2019 train, was also used to publicise the service in ever more ingenious ways: stunts were organised with the train racing pigeons, speedboats and aeroplanes. The media were always on hand to record the moment. Many of Flying Scotsman\u2019s sister engines were named after celebrated racehorses and the travelling experience positioned the train in the world of glamour, speed and innovation. Cinema, television and radio were trialled on board. There were other innovations too \u2013 hairdressing salons, ladies retiring rooms, air conditioning, \u2018health giving\u2019 windows, all electric kitchens, a Louis XV-style restaurant and even a cocktail bar \u2013 all designed as one contemporary commentator noted to \u2018beguile in various ways, the hours of this lengthy journey\u2019 (Allen, 1946). This was all cemented by expert advertising and consistent branding including a headboard designed by Eric Gill (one of the earliest uses of his Gill Sans font).[8] The \u2018Flying Scotsman\u2019 locomotive and train were positioned as modernist icons famed for speed, style and service.\nThe fame spread beyond the UK: the LNER advertised the service in North America through an agent based in New York, whilst it built on its already established movie fame through a significant role in Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s 1935 film The 39 Steps (McLean, 2016). Throughout the first half of the twentieth century the \u2018Flying Scotsman\u2019 had been regularly refreshed with new rolling stock, the latest locomotives and the most up-to-date on-board features, thus ensuring that the service remained at the forefront of the modern British railway system. This tradition continued in 1962 \u2013 the centenary of the service \u2013 when the \u2018Flying Scotsman\u2019 was reinvented once more as symbolic of a new and modern era.[9] The latest rolling stock was provided for the train, which was to be hauled by the new Deltic diesel, a truly transformative development being not only fast and powerful but futuristic in its styling. But in 1962 the future of the locomotive of the same name was less assured. The British Railways (BR) modernisation programme launched in 1955 marked the beginning of the end for steam. When it was revealed that steam would continue into the 1970s, BR accelerated the programme of scrapping locomotives (Gourvish, 1986). The statistics are revealing: in 1953 there were still 18,600 steam locomotives operating on the British railway system; but by 1962, Flying Scotsman\u2019s last full year in service, the number had more than halved to 8,800 and within six years that had dropped to zero (Gourvish, 1986 p 275). To ensure historic locomotives or relics survived a number of locomotives were identified for preservation. However, amongst the omissions was Flying Scotsman, which was earmarked for scrap. In 1962 the Gresley A3 Preservation Society was established to raise funds to save the locomotive but in the event they could not match the \u00a33,000 asking price.\u00a0\nHowever, a wealthy businessman by the name of Alan Pegler stepped in and acquired the locomotive. He secured a remarkable deal from British Railways allowing him to overhaul, repaint and stable Flying Scotsman at Doncaster Works as well as securing the rights to operate the locomotive on the main line (Pegler et al, 1970).\u00a0"},

Here they were the last in a line of the Museum\u2019s self-consciously created treasures of rare survivals, \u2018firsts\u2019 or items associated with famous names, including an Islamic glass alembic, Stephenson\u2019s Rocket, a sample of Parkesine plastic and the Crick-Watson DNA model. In the Making the Modern World gallery (opened in 2000) they sit along a central aisle of big hitters, making use of both the \u2018peaks of the great achievements of fundamental science\u2019 and the \u2018massive materiality\u2019 of large-scale technology (Russell, 2006; Bud, 2017).Massive materiality (practicalities of transport and storage notwithstanding) remains a key part of the curator\u2019s repertoire of tactics for making contemporary science appeal to visitors. Alvin Weinberg famously predicted that \u2018when history looks at the 20th century\u2026she will find in the monuments of Big Science \u2013 the huge rockets, the high-energy accelerators, the high-flux research reactors \u2013 symbols of our time just as surely as she finds in Notre Dame a symbol of the Middle Ages\u2019 (Weinberg, 1961). Space technology displays certainly tend towards the monumental, with the Smithsonian\u2019s National Air and Space Museum a notable example: at its opening in 1977 a nationalistic, hero-centric narrative was discernible in the exhibits, and it remains to be seen what tone will be taken by major refurbishments underway from 2018 (McMahon, 1981; Meltzer, 1981). The (up to now) largely national-interest domination of space exploration is also seen in recent displays in China, where science museums rarely display original artefacts but the national science and technology museum makes much of the Shenzen programme (Sch\u00e4fer and Song, 2017). Big tech has also dominated space technology displays at the Science Museum, with British and American narratives prevalent in the (ageing) permanent gallery, although the recent approach of the Cosmonauts exhibition signals a drive towards broader coverage of social and cultural motivators for space exploration (Millard, 2016).Meanwhile in particle physics, copper accelerating cavities from CERN\u2019s Large Electron Positron collider (LEP) have been a gift to several museums worldwide; literally as a donation from CERN, but also to curatorial interpretation. These cavities hit a \u2018sweet spot\u2019 in terms of size \u2013 large enough to be impressive and attract visitors, but just small enough to fit into a museum gallery and be installed without vast expense. They also have a delightful Jules Verne quality. When one was displayed in the Science Museum\u2019s Collider exhibition (2013\u201314), the London Review of Books likened it to \u2018the bust of a copper robot from the golden age of sci-fi, with a bulbous round head, ribbed skin, red cyclopean eye and silver claws which project, raptor-style, from what would be its breast\u2019; meanwhile, at National Museums Scotland, Keeper Sam Alberti hopes that the striking cavity, prominent in the atrium, might tempt visitors towards the science and technology galleries (opened in 2016) much as Picasso\u2019s Capra or the Lewis Chessmen might attract people to the adjacent art and design galleries (Richardson, 2014; Alberti, 2017; Desborough, 2017). However, big is not necessarily beautiful. The Science Museum has an object on display that combines massive materiality with being a great achievement of fundamental science: the prototype beam-splitter for Advanced LIGO, the twin experiments which in 2016 detected the gravitational waves long predicted by Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity. However, despite its size it is a challenging object aesthetically, and its function in the LIGO setup (at the intersection of two 4km-long interferometer arms) is not immediately apparent, requiring additional animation interpretation beyond the object label.\nLIGO also encapsulates a challenge for contemporary collecting: with thousands of people working on many of today\u2019s projects, the overall effect can be de-personalising. Even where individuals have been singled out, for example with the award of Nobel Prizes, they will rarely become \u2018famous names\u2019 beyond their own professional spheres. Those who have achieved widespread name recognition have often done this due to their efforts in popularising science. Stephen Hawking was surely the most famous scientist of recent times, but the first to be honoured with a burial at Westminster Abbey for almost eighty years (Westminster Abbey, 2020). But most visitors to the Abbey will know him for his popular books and media appearances, rather than have really engaged with the work on radiation from black holes depicted on his memorial. Similarly, Science\u2019s list of top Twitter stars includes several people who these days spend more of their time on mass media outputs than on academic publications (and if you are going to engage people with the daily realities of your practice, it helps to be an astronaut) (Travis and Science, 2014).\nGenerally, for curators trawling the material culture of science of recent science, it can be difficult to spot what Simon Schaffer has termed \u2018charismatic megafauna\u2019 \u2013 compelling, important objects, often associated with celebrated people or events, which can provide a hook upon which to tell the stories of a wide range of practitioners, as with the Board of Longitude research and exhibition projects run by the University of Cambridge and National Maritime Museum (2010\u201315) (Schaffer, 2014). Making the Modern World adopts a similar tactic: away from the central aisle of \u2018icons\u2019 can be found a wider range of objects which speak more to professional practice and everyday use. For contemporary science, these types of object may on first glance occupy the \u2018low lands\u2019 of objects that are less inherently interesting, or are simply too complex to explain (Bud, 2017). Ad Maas, curator at the Dutch Rijksmuseum Boerhaave, envies his counterparts working on earlier periods. Unlike his colleagues who look after the Museum\u2019s collections of artfully-made (and usually shiny) objects from the Dutch Golden Age, he rarely comes across an object that is unique or attractive in his trawls of sheds, storerooms, basements and attics, commenting that he and his ilk \u2018taking care of modern artefacts are the scrap dealers\u2019 (Maas, 2013). However, we ought to remember that the shiny or charismatic objects in museums are the survivors, and are not representative of all types of objects in circulation and use in the past. And while there may be some pragmatic concerns to preserving the material culture of recent science and technology (for example size, and short-lived materials such as plastics), several curators of science and technology museums have argued that such artefacts do not necessary pose radically greater intellectual challenges than those from a more distant past.[3]Aesthetically, a mass-produced grey metal and plastic PCR machine may indeed lack the instant eye-catching appeal and \u2018material charisma\u2019 of a shiny brass astrolabe (Alberti et al, 2018). But while the astrolabe\u2019s form reveals its function, it only does this to the initiated viewer. Whether to the curator seeking to preserve information for the future, or to the visitor encountering a display on gallery, technical artefacts from many periods are complex and do not speak clearly. Other reasons frequently cited for the complexity of contemporary collecting are the distributed and de-localised nature of science, and the rapid turnover of equipment (de Chadarevian, 2018; Boyle and Hagmann, 2017). But while the scales of production and pace of change of equipment may have increased, historians of science can point to many examples of geographically-distributed work, and equipment becoming obsolete or repurposed.[4] This may not always be apparent from museum collections initially built around national narratives or seeded from institutional or business collections, with a tendency to favour objects in good physical condition. As for current science being a somewhat faceless activity, surveys of visitor knowledge and attitudes repeatedly show that (aside from a few big names such as Newton, Einstein and Curie) the majority of past practitioners of science, technology and medicine are no better known to most museum-goers than today\u2019s are. And, of course, even those names that have come down to us from the past are a subset.Collecting the contemporary has long been a fundamental activity of science and technology museums \u2013 indeed, the historic collections have often become so purely by dint of time spent in the museum \u2013 but many such collections were originally amassed with pedagogical or commemorative intent and there are many gaps in the stories they can tell (Bennett, 2005). They are likely to represent more attractive than mundane objects, more successes than failures, more finished products than works-in-progress or tools for making and repair, more scientists than instrument-makers, more inventors than users. They often reflect in the material record the power dynamics of different periods, with people excluded on the basis of gender, ethnicity, sexuality, disability or socio-economic background. Even as the broader approach of social history collecting was gaining traction in many museums, the rise of the science centre approach \u2013 itself intended as anti-establishment and democratising \u2013 meant that many organisations called \u2018science museum\u2019 were moving towards interactive exhibits which focused on phenomena rather than people, and in many museums collecting steeply declined.[5] But informed by questions of interest to historians, when collecting in the present we can endeavour to collect a wider cross-section of artefacts and stories than may have come down to museums from the past. The issue then might be not so much what are the difficulties of collecting contemporary science, as what are the opportunities of collecting \u2018in the moment\u2019?"},

People are appointed to jobs and get on with the work given to them. Some appointees will move on to different careers, but those who stick with the profession will develop a career\u2019s worth of curatorial experience, gaining scope for creative control of their professional practice as they become more senior. It is probably only when we make the case for promotion into new roles that we articulate how our experience and beliefs make us suitable to do specific work within curation. But a retirement from full-time paid curatorial employment does offer the opportunity to consider the shape and emphases of a career, and this is the opportunity that we seize here with this mini-festschrift devoted to the career of Robert Bud. In so doing, we contribute to the reflective practice strand that we like to encourage in the Science Museum Group Journal. For the sake of those of us employed in heritage organisations, such reflective writing can help us to compare, understand, communicate and modify our own practice. For our friends in the universities, it may assist in building the mutual understanding between the two sectors on which good future research collaborations will be built.\nWe rarely stop to consider styles of museum curating, but in the preparation of this collection of articles we have had the opportunity to do so in Robert\u2019s case, and it is clear that his mode has been very particular. It is difficult to think of other curators in science museums who have so energetically pursued academic research and writing as Robert has; his publication record of major books and articles would be no disgrace to a highly productive full-time university-based academic. These include such definitive works as The Uses of Life: A History of Biotechnology (1994), Penicillin: Triumph and Tragedy (2007) and Instruments of Science: An Historical Encyclopedia (edited with Debbie Warner, 1998). But the fact is that Robert\u2019s curatorial practice has been equally energetic. He was a \u2018hungry\u2019 collector, especially in his years as one of the Science Museum\u2019s chemistry curators in the 1980s. He was keen to ensure that the chemical industry was well represented in the nation\u2019s collection. And this wasn\u2019t simply a matter of acquiring \u2018icons\u2019 such as, famously, the Haber-Bosch reaction vessel for the synthesis of ammonia, which now sits, monument-like, in a field at our National Collections Centre in Wiltshire.\nNo, Robert was alert to the ways in which the contents of closing down industrial research laboratories and production plants could be collected to represent styles of research practice that the Museum ought to represent, including a 3,000-gallon wooden vat used in the manufacture of Kromaline (sulphonated fish oil for treating dried leather) from ICI Blackley Works, and a compressor from the Solvay Soda Works, Winnington. The collecting he did while working on the Uses of Life, including unique and experimental fermenters, have left future curators with a magnificent material legacy of a key technology of our era. This was collecting alongside events, as Robert managed to establish our biotechnology collection in the 1980s \u2013 almost at the same moment as modern biotechnology itself was launched. This enabled the Museum to acquire such seminal objects as the \u2018oncomouse\u2019 (see Alison Boyle\u2019s article in this issue), which was the first patented animal, two examples of which sit freeze-dried in the Making the Modern World gallery, and the prototype polymerase chain reaction (PCR) machine for gene amplification from the Cetus Corporation in California.\nRobert was also responsible, in the 1980s, for three distinctive interventions in display technique with his galleries on Petroleum (1983), Plastics (1985) and the Chemical Industry (1986). Each of these was not simply a collection display, but a vehicle for experiments in display narrative and language, each fed by his historical reinterpretations.\nPromoted to Keeper, in the 1990s he was able to open the door to a more academic model of curatorship for the wider curatorial team, when he won the argument that doctoral study was a good route to professionalising curatorial practice. This enabled six colleagues to undertake doctoral study, including the current author. At the same time he continued to send out the invitations for the Museum\u2019s seminar programme (latterly with Imperial College\u2019s Centre for the History of Science, Technology and Medicine), which saw presentations by all the major figures in science studies at the time. The first decade of the current century, against the background of a series of different Science Museum directors with differing priorities, saw Robert dive with \u00e9lan into the new waters of online museology, leading on three sites that were definitive in their time: Ingenious, Making the Modern World and Brought to Life.[1] In his final Museum decade he was able to work, via two AHRC fellowships, on a summative book on the history of the idea of applied science, bringing together many of his career-spanning concerns. The co-edited volume Being Modern: The Cultural Impact of Science in the Early Twentieth Century (2018) was an early fruit of this endeavour.\nThere is a kind of science public intellectual \u2013 Julian Huxley or Jacob Bronowski perhaps \u2013 whose self-imposed exiles from the universities led them to develop and pursue rather idiosyncratic views of science. I make two observations in relation to Robert\u2019s case. First, he too has pursued very distinctive interpretations of the history of science and technology, including his analysis of the roots of biotechnology or the semiotic status of wonder drugs such as penicillin. His work is always in pursuit of a more interesting explanation. But, second, Robert has done this very much as a \u2018back room boy\u2019, never seeking the celebrity status craved by those other two individuals. Instead, he has tried to provoke the Museum to work in a different register by developing new kinds of narratives of science and technology, narratives that are based on thinking hard about the place of material culture within the stories of science. You might say that his mode has been that of the ventriloquist, helping the Museum to speak in unaccustomed voices.\nMany curators primarily work up from the collections they inherit; Robert\u2019s instinct has always been in the opposite direction; his approach has been to work down from the historical reality as he constructs it to the objects that may represent it. That is what made him such an acquisitive curator; he was, in his academic work, developing a sense of the major narratives of modern science, and that led him to make sure that those areas were well represented in the collections. He went from the research to the curatorial practice. Studying the pervasiveness of penicillin, for example, he learned that a cosmetics company had once marketed a penicillin lipstick. Of course, Robert couldn\u2019t rest until he was able to add to the collection a lipstick that purported to be one such. He was tickled, I think, that it was impossible to tell whether or not it did contain the drug. And here\u2019s the point: it was the story that mattered; he understands that ascriptions of authenticity only make sense within narratives, but that narratives are flexible, alterable things. Curatorial practice must, it follows, use exhibitions to convey new stories about science, use collecting to enable a great multiplicity of stories to be told, and use research constantly to worry-away at the relationship between the two. It must constantly travel between the extremes of the parachutist\u2019s view and the instinct of the truffle-hunter and back again (a metaphor from Le Roy Ladurie that Robert will tease me for using once again (Boon, 2018)).\nNo short selection of articles can truly respond to the richness and complexity of a 40-year career. All the same, the four articles presented here sketch-out the work that a festschrift should do. A festschrift \u2013 \u2018a collection of writings in honour of a scholar\u2019 (OED) \u2013 was originally a German tradition, and that also seems fitting for someone who has always brought an international perspective to his work here at the Science Museum in London. Our process was to ask Robert to reflect on some of his career stages and to propose a colleague who might have something interesting to say. As it happens, the four essays nicely complement each other, bringing differing facets of Robert\u2019s concerns in turn to light. Alison Boyle\u2019s article on contemporary collecting marks her out as a curator who has drunk at the same well as Robert in her acquisitions. Helmuth Trischler reveals a career-long collaboration with Robert in building the international networks that have enabled like-minded curators to spread good practice linking academic and curatorial concerns across continents. Principal among these was the Artefacts consortium, which has recently passed its 23rd birthday. Meanwhile, Bernadette Bensaude-Vincent and Jeffrey Sturchio speak to the scholarly side of Robert\u2019s enterprise, with, respectively, a Gallic commentary on his historical etymology of \u2018applied science\u2019 and a partner piece on industrial research, taking Kodak as a case study.\nWriting this brief reflective introduction makes me realise to what a large extent the stimulus of working with Robert over three decades (with each of us in turn taking-up the boss role, always in a spirit of friendship mixed with enjoyable mutual challenge) has provoked my own sense of what constitutes good curatorial practice. I too am a curator committed to the parallel and connected practice of research and curatorship. I owe that, at least in large part, to his comradeship."},

Fairfield lies in Govan \u2013 at the heart of Scottish ship-building \u2013 and is a symbol of the changing fortunes of the industry on the River Clyde. Fairfield Heritage is the local community\u2019s response to the decline and changes to an industry which has affected both the commercial and geo-political global landscape for some two hundred years. This review is based upon a visit to Fairfield, conversations with staff, and observations from the literature and digital presence of Fairfield.\nThe aim of this review is to illustrate how Fairfield has developed into a multi-functional heritage centre and office space, and a community-focussed education centre. It will also consider the previous roles and uses of the building and look to how this model of offices/heritage centre mash-up may be applied elsewhere. Finally, it elicits a challenge for heritage: to consider how Fairfield is striving to be a force for social change in Govan and how this can be scaled to other places, as other industries decline and change.\nAs a global industry, the focus of ship-building has gradually moved over the past fifty years from the industrial West to centres of cheap labour and strong markets. As a consequence, ship-building in Glasgow (and Govan in particular) has virtually disappeared, with surviving operations, such as the BAE Systems ship-building in the Fairfield Yard, representing just a small fraction of an industry that was once a major employer. In order to understand the origins, architecture and, most importantly, the people of Fairfield, we need to acknowledge the beginnings of Glasgow's heavy industry twins: engineering and ship-building. However, starting in the past and working to the present would do the modern incarnation of Fairfield a disservice. Therefore, this review focuses on the current and future direction of Fairfield, with full acknowledgement of its history. This model of approach, putting the present and future first, is a common one for contemporary heritages today (for examples see Graves-Brown, Harrison &amp; Picinni, 2014). It is an approach that appears to be gaining currency in recognising that heritage is no longer just a 'visitor attraction', but projects like Fairfield can play a part in a systemic approach that includes social development.\u00a0\nHow did the Fairfield of today take shape and why did it happen? By 2001, the building, which had been built between 1889 and 1891, was vacant. Six years later the building was still empty and damage through weathering had become an increasing issue. Govan Workspace, a local economic development agency who now owns the building, was asked by the previous owner to try and find a new use for this Clyde icon. The result was a restoration project organised and run by a group of dedicated individuals who worked collaboratively to co-design and co-produce the redevelopment of the building itself and the reimagining of the uses to which it could be put. At the core of this project was the recognition that the building and its future functions would reflect its past significance and value through community participation. What those specific roles of participation were had yet to be defined.\nBetween 2008 and 2012, emergency repairs preceded full restoration and then the adaptation of the interior spaces began. Despite difficulties the group came up with a business plan and through funding streams and partnership collaborations it began to develop an opportunity to save the building with a 'mixed economy' usage model. This approach may not necessarily be new, but it is a model that is being applied to significant places that might previously have been turned into a single-purpose heritage centre. This subtle but important difference recognises that local businesses and heritage spaces can function together effectively and serve the purposes of multiple community needs. This illustrates that there was recognition that combined functions, including local businesses, are an integral part of the community. But also that the manner in which those businesses are housed and situated can combine within heritage buildings.\nWhen Fairfield re-opened in July 2014 it was described as a \u2018time capsule\u2019. This evokes an image of past glory which has been kept hidden from view. However, once visited it is clear that Fairfield is very much more. The ground-floor comprises former managerial and administrative offices that have been converted into an exhibition/museum space. Additional rooms are provided for education purposes and the original board room has been retained \u2013 it\u2019s refreshing to see a portrait of a woman on the boardroom wall.\nThe building is also now home to an art gallery; it provides exhibition space, is a museum to Govan ship-building, an educational space, extensive and adaptable office spaces, and remains a symbol of civic pride. Ship-building and engineering are symbolised by the statues either side of the front door and it is these two parallel strands of heavy industry that are developed in the gallery and exhibitions rooms on the ground floor. Upstairs, work goes on apace in the rented office spaces. To date, one of the best clients has been BAE themselves, the company recognising the value of the space and the opportunity to use it both for corporate and social functions.\u00a0\nAs we go up the grand staircase, the archaeologist in me noticed the evidence of the traffic of time. There is extra wear on the inner tread of each stair, always on the inner handrail side. This reflects a need for speed when staff travelled up and down the stairs and reflects the efficient business that built the ships in the adjacent fabrication yard. Upstairs we see an altogether changed building; one of white walls and modern mezzanine floors. This is where the local meets global, where floor space is rented out to local businesses and the income fed back into Fairfield and Govan Workspace social enterprise agency. The offices provide amazing facilities and the light levels are unsurpassed. With north-facing windows and roof lights, the light quality is consistent and clear. All this has resulted from the original architects being given the brief to provide spaces for printers and draftsmen who required consistency and the quality of light provided by a northern aspect. Architectural plans of the original building demonstrate its functional design, such as managers having their own staircases that would take them directly from their first floor offices down to their areas of responsibility; engine-building or ship fabrication. This was management hierarchy embodied into architectural design, with the aim of maximising manufacturing output and sustaining the company\u2019s order books.\nToday, the heritage centre hosts oral history projects and it receives donations of objects from local people who have friends or relatives who worked in the yard. This means that it is accruing an archive. The heritage exhibitions space is well laid out (chronologically) and includes an enormous amount of information. It combines personal stories with evidence of the global influence of the ship-building/engineering industries. The exhibitions cleverly use the space provided by the wood-panelled rooms and there is an array of mediums through which the information is presented. These range from digital interactive maps to full height images of riveters on the walls. Screens present archive footage from the Scottish Screen archive and a 3D digital interactive display, developed with the Glasgow School of Art Digital Design Studio, enables the user to travel along the Clyde, through space and time.\nFairfield Heritage has developed fruitful networks with the public and many volunteers are sustaining their work strands. They are currently preparing a schools programme, community participation and education programmes. Volunteers contribute to the running of the building and are also engaged in a steering group which ensures that they are integral to the process of taking the project forward. The volunteers feed in their ideas for success but they also hold the key to understanding how some of the manufacturing processes were undertaken \u2013 in some cases using their first-hand experiences. For example, some of the tools in the exhibition cases were used by the people who are now volunteering to run the heritage centre.\nSo how can Fairfield help other heritage places to become centres for social cohesion, economic development and progressive change for communities that have been affected by industrial decline? I think one of the clues lies in the embedded nature of many of the people who undertake the hard work to get these projects off the ground. People, who live and work in the locations of the heritage project, bring their networks, contacts and \u2018embeddedness\u2019 to bear on fruitful projects. But once projects are up and running, their success is as much due to the skills of the fundraisers and co-ordinators who sustain the places, as well as the hardworking volunteers with whom they collaborate.\nThe origins of Fairfield lie in the early days of ship-building on the River Clyde at Govan, and the yard engineering works and docks combined to build over 750 vessels from 1886. But the building today, its uses and the ethos of Fairfield Heritage is a model of how heritage centres can be developed thorough partnerships to create new uses for old buildings, and invest civic pride in specific spaces and places. Most importantly, Fairfield exemplifies a place where memory, building fabric and people with passion, drive and commitment can develop new socio-economic models that wrap community heritages with local businesses."},

The long history of human society and its energy use is usually divided into different eras according to each era\u2019s primary energy source, punctuated by shifts from one dominant energy source to another through energy transitions (Melosi, 2006; Smil, 2010). For the creation of the modern world, according to E A Wrigley (1988, 2010), the most significant change was the transition from the organic economy to the mineral economy. Indeed, the harnessing of coal in the \u2018subterranean forest\u2019 was the major contributor to Britain\u2019s Industrial Revolution and subsequent industrialisation of other nations (Sieferle, 2001). Global historian Kenneth Pomeranz (2000) raised the same point when he attributed the diverging paths of modern economic development in the East and the West largely to different nations\u2019 geographic proximity to coal reserves and ability to exploit energy resources. The potential of energy resources was best realised when energy availability was accompanied by relevant technology to convert energy to serve human purposes. Such \u2018development blocks\u2019 of energy and other technologies could be seen in the close links between coal, the steam engine and the metallurgical process of iron-making during the Industrial Revolution, or, the linkage between oil and the internal combustion engine in the twentieth century (Kander, Malanima and Warde, 2013). These long-term perspectives are essential for understanding how energy and culture are connected. However, in works of energy history written from the macro perspective, culture is usually seen as secondary to other factors of economy, technology and resource availability. For this reason, the following survey takes a narrower historical perspective, focusing chiefly on the historical literature covering the long twentieth century.In terms of the energy history of the twentieth century, the most widely discussed topic has been the energy development of America, reflecting the nation\u2019s leading role in technical advances and the diffusion of modern energy, notably electricity and oil. John Hammond\u2019s (1941) Men and Volts and Arthur Bright\u2019s (1949) The Electric-Lamp Industry were among the pioneering works investigating the origin and progress of electric technology. Historical research on energy saw significant strides in the 1980s, when several urban historians began to systematically analyse energy development in major cities, chiefly from the perspective of the competition between electricity and gas. Mark Rose (1988, 1995) studied the growth of the electricity and gas industries in Kansas, Denver and Detroit, and Harold Platt (1988, 1991) investigated Chicago, one of the heartlands of early twentieth-century electrification. In the systematic investigation of historical energy development, Thomas Hughes\u2019 (1983) Networks of Power has had a profound impact on subsequent studies. Hughes\u2019 work shifted the historical narrative of energy away from specific inventions, inventors or corporations and toward the assemblage of innovative technology, expertise and business operations. Together, these formed what he called large technological systems, the prime example of which was the electricity supply system (Hughes, 1989). In Networks of Power, Hughes illustrated how the socio-technical assemblage \u2013 through the work of system builders (e.g. inventors, engineers, business managers and financiers) \u2013 gradually gained \u2018technological momentum\u2019 in his selective case studies on major cities in the United States, Germany and England.\nHughes\u2019 work paved the way for writing the history of the expansion of electricity supply well beyond the United States, as his comparative analysis rested on the recognition of variations (in his words, \u2018styles\u2019) in how networks were built in different parts of the world. This approach made technological transfer a legitimate starting point for narrating the development of a nation\u2019s power network, a theme taken up by Edmund Todd\u2019s (1989) article on the German region of the Ruhr, Armstrong and Nelles\u2019 (1986) book on Canada, and Timo Myllyntaus\u2019 (1991) book on the electrification of Finland. The development of the power network in Europe has become a well-researched field that covers a wide range of topics, such as the electrification of inter-war Central European nations (Hallon, 2001) and the transnational aspects of Europe-wide grid development (Lagendijk, 2008; Van der Vleuten and Kaijser, 2006). One key factor in the development of national and regional variations was politics. Jonathan Coopersmith (1992) expanded the scope of Hughes\u2019 original discussion, which drew exclusively from cases of capitalist countries, by turning to 1920s Russia, where the Communist Party\u2019s political agenda and the technical visions of engineers were two wheels of electrification. Ronan Shamir (2013) examined 1920s Palestine and found that the country\u2019s power network during the period was not just an embodiment of colonialist economic interests, but that the electrical grid was also a socio-technical infrastructure that helped to create and consolidate the ethno-national division between the Jewish and Arab populations. In a similar vein, Rao and Lourdusamy (2010) and Sunila Kale (2014) discussed the formative influence of colonialism and regional politics in fostering distinctive variations within India\u2019s electrification.\u00a0"},

It tells the story of how information and communication technologies have transformed our lives over the last two hundred years. Through a display of over eight hundred unique objects this 2500m2 gallery seeks to expose, examine and celebrate the technology that has changed the way we connect with one another and to illuminate how human creativity has defined and shaped our information and communications networks.\nThere are six zones in the gallery, each representing a different technology network: The Cable, The Telephone Exchange, Broadcast, The Constellation, The Cell, and The Web. The gallery explores the important events that shaped the development of these networks, from the growth of the worldwide telegraph network in the nineteenth century, to the influence of mobile phones on our lives today. Parallel stories of the past, present and future of communications technologies are told through the eyes of those who invented, operated, and were affected by each new wave of technology.[1] Information Age combines showcase displays, innovative digital interpretation and immersive environments and has a dedicated workshop space and accompanying learning programme. The gallery targets families with children aged 11 years and over, independent adult non-science specialists and school pupils and their teachers. Within these target audiences and in line with the Museum\u2019s Audience Development Plan (Science Museum, 2015), the gallery is also intended to appeal to new visitors from black and minority ethnic and lower socio-economic backgrounds, as well as visitors with disabilities.\nParticipation activities on the Information Age gallery development drew upon a long history of participation and audience engagement initiatives at the Science Museum. In various ways and across different kinds of projects, audiences have been invited to collaborate with staff over a number of years. For example, audience-led events to engage under-represented groups in contemporary science debate at the Museum\u2019s Dana Centre; a collaborative project with transgender youth leading to a co-created display case within the Who Am I? gallery; the involvement of audience groups to co-curate the Oramics to Electronica exhibition; and co-creation experiments in various temporary exhibitions on current science issues in the Antenna area of the Museum[2].\nBuilding on these predominantly smaller-scale initiatives, which had resulted in largely temporary outputs, the Information Age gallery was an opportunity to extend and further embed the use of participatory practices in the development of a major new permanent gallery, an approach that tested the institution\u2019s understanding of the role, purpose and place of collaboratively produced outputs.\nInspiration was taken from other large-scale permanent redevelopments, such as the community-centred Riverside Museum in Glasgow, which gave Science Museum staff the confidence to explore ways of embedding user stories into its own interpretation on a larger scale than it had previously attempted.\nThe decision to use participatory methods in the development of the Information Age gallery was given additional impetus by the Museum\u2019s concern to develop galleries that could appeal to more diverse audiences. The Museum saw an opportunity to foster greater inclusivity and to reach out to new, currently under-represented audiences, by inviting specific groups to research, plan and create with the Museum. The theme of user-driven innovation and development was central to Information Age and naturally converged with the desire to include a diversity of voices (including those of the visitor) in the gallery\u2019s narrative. This meant that there was an obvious synergy between the gallery\u2019s aims to showcase the voice of the users \u2013 the people who felt the influence of communication technology \u2013 and the Museum's ambitions to extend participation practice. With this in mind the principal objective for Information Age was to create, through the process of participation, high quality and nuanced experiences for visitors who would encounter the participation project outputs in the gallery. In this way, the main driver for the participatory practice within the gallery was not sharing of authority with communities per se but rather the enhancement of the experience for future visitors to the gallery that would be produced by participatory methods. It was hoped that visitors to Information Age, who encountered a gallery shaped by collaborative means, might find greater relevance to their lives, and stories they could relate to more readily. Another feature of Information Age was that unlike the Museum\u2019s other participation projects, which tended to originate in the Learning or Contemporary Science departments, a cross-disciplinary exhibition team including engagement, curatorial, content development, evaluation and new media staff took on responsibility for delivering these initiatives. From the beginning, the entire cross-disciplinary team was supported and trained not only in how to work in a more participatory way (often in unfamiliar ways and with audiences they had no prior experience of engaging), but also in understanding why this could be a beneficial way of working, how it would benefit their own practice and what the impact and outcomes were. It quickly became clear that in order to foster a shared understanding of the goals of participation among the staff, a consistent and clear language was needed. To date, collaborative work with the public at the Science Museum had already been termed in various ways, but with the huge variety of experience and expertise across the Information Age team, the need for clarity in language and meaning was brought into sharp relief, and understanding how notions of 'participation' were commonly applied in the sector, and how they were to be applied at the Science Museum, became an important task."},

The term Scientia was reserved for subjects searching for the ultimate causes \u2013 physics, metaphysics and theology. Seven liberal arts were taught. For the master\u2019s degree in arts the student had to go through the trivium \u2013 grammar, logic and rhetoric \u2013 and then the quadrivium \u2013 arithmetic, geometry, music theory and astronomy. The Mechanical arts were not taught at university but medical faculties opened up in a number of European cities in the twelfth century.\nThe conventional dichotomy between theory and practice often subdivided the contents of arts. For instance a Dictionnaire math\u00e9matique published in Amsterdam by Jacques Ozanam distinguished the speculative or theoretical part focused on the knowledge of something from the practical part teaching how to operate with it. Similarly the introduction of chemical arts in medical faculties in the seventeenth century prompted the distinction between theoretical and practical chemistry. Pierre Joseph Macquer, who published El\u00e9mens the chimie th\u00e9orique in 1749 followed by El\u00e9mens the chimie pratique in 1751, claimed that the former could be presented according to a systematic logical order (from simple to complex), while the latter had to detail the procedures of chemical operations.\nWhile science/arts, and theory/practice remained generic categories used for mapping knowledge, the divide between pure and applied emerged locally for distinguishing two distinct perspectives on a particular subject. The divide between pure and applied has been traced back to Johannes Wallis\u2019s Mathesis universalis (1657). He contrasted mathematica pura dealing with quantity in an absolute or abstract sense and mathematica mixta where quantities were attached to something. Later Christian Wolff distinguished mathesis impure sive mixta from mathesis pura sive simplex (Meinel, 1983:131). Ironically it is a chemist who replaced the term \u2018mixt\u2019, taken from the language of chemistry, by the term \u2018applied\u2019. In 1751, Johann Gottshalk Wallerius, a lecturer at Uppsala University, introduced the distinction between chemia pura and chemia applicata in a dissertation De nexu chemiae cum utilitate reipublicae (On the connections of chemistry with utility of the republic). He clearly stated that the old divides between science and art, and theory and practice, were obsolete since applied chemistry could be presented as a practising science (Meinel, 1983: 126\u2013127). His textbook distinguished nine branches in applied chemistry, which covered most chemical arts: medical chemistry, stone chemistry, metal chemistry, fire chemistry, salt chemistry, glass chemistry, economic chemistry, colour chemistry and crafts chemistry. The conceptual dichotomy between pure and applied chemistry astutely turned the chronological antecedence of chemical arts over chemical knowledge into a logical relation of dependence of arts upon science, a dependence of chemical practice upon a core-theory that Wallerius considered as the foundation of applied chemistry. At about the same time in France, in Macquer\u2019s textbooks, although the volume about practice was published after the volume about theory, the practical chemistry was by no means subordinated to theory, nor was it of less importance. Theory and practice were on an equal footing.[1] By contrast, the dichotomy between pure and applied science suggested a relation of dependence. It seems that the divide pure/applied chemistry was part of the chemists\u2019 struggle for status. It actually provided a key argument for the promotion of chemistry as a science on the academic stage.\nThe notion of pure science or andgewandte Wissenschaft spread in Scandinavia and Germany through translations of Wallerius\u2019s treatise where it apparently benefitted from a collusion or confusion[2] with Kant\u2019s notion of pure knowledge (Bud, 2012). Whatever the fluctuations of the exact meaning of the adjectives \u2018pure\u2019 and \u2018applied\u2019, this dichotomy undoubtedly created a continuity between two varieties of science which overcame the difference of nature implicit in the conventional dichotomy between science and art. In a long-term perspective, the invention of the divide between pure and applied science appears as a symptom of the increasing valuation of science and its primacy over arts in European society. In this respect it is often presented as a marker of modernity, characterised by the primacy of science over technology (Forman, 2007)."},

Cities in the north and south were infected almost simultaneously (Corradi, 2nd edition, 1972\u20133, Vol 1, pp 578\u2013625 and Vol 5, pp 334\u20138; Cohn, 2010, p 19). In the north the disease spread from Trento and its territory to Venice and Verona, then on to Mantua and Milan in 1576 (Lodigiani, 1978, p 364). Following a spike in the number of reported deaths, officials in the city of Mantua announced that it was infected with the disease on 27 March 1576 and a temporary health board was appointed to create and implement public health strategies. The city was treated as a site and potential source of infection, and the job of health officials was to identify those sources and clean or remove them. The regulations and strategies they used were similar to those employed by health boards in other infected cities; restrictions were placed on contact between people, on travel and on trade; people who were infected (or were suspected of being infected) were removed and taken to plague hospitals; and streets were cleaned regularly to remove rubbish. Mantua\u2019s health office was not a permanent entity, therefore health officials worked with, and relied on, religious groups and the broader community to restore the city to good health. Despite their actions approximately one fifth to one sixth of the population died during the epidemic (Belfanti, 1981, pp 65\u20135).\nThis threat of an epidemic from both North and South led to a shift in public health activities with civic responses across the region being bolstered by Counter Reformation Catholicism (Cohn, 2010, pp 292\u20133, p 300). In fact, processions formed part of public health programmes of many Italian cities in 1576 with varying levels of spectacle and participation. In Bologna, a city not infected by plague, a broadsheet printed in July 1576 gave directions for priests of the dioceses, which included holding processions within churches and ensuring the people prayed for the cessation of the plague in infected areas as well as for the continued health of Bologna.[2] In stark contrast, Venice was one of the cities devastated by the epidemic with approximately one third of the population falling victim to it. Venice had both a well-developed public health system and a rich tradition of grand civic ritual (Palmer, 1978; Muir, 1981). These elements combined in plague processions which (along with the worship of relics) Iain Fenlon describes as \u2018fundamental weapons\u2019 during plague crises (Fenlon, 2007, p 224). The need to placate the anger of God \u2018required urgent and persistent intercession through prayer, charitable works and communal spiritual exercises\u2019 (Fenlon, 2007, p 224). One such exercise was a procession of atonement held in Venice on 14 August 1576, the feast of Saint Roch, a saint that became associated with healing the plague (Boeckl, 2000, pp 57\u20138). Groups from every parish in Venice met outside the saint\u2019s church and processed as a group reciting prayers and chanting litanies (Fenlon, 2007, p 225). In September 1576, after a terrible summer, the Doge, Senate and other members of Venice\u2019s governing body processed around the piazza of San Marco on three successive days. Given the seriousness of the situation the Venetians processed with a special Byzantine art work thought to bring luck to those engaged in war, as it was felt the city was at war with the epidemic (Fenlon, 2007, p 225). In neighbouring Milan, Archbishop Carlo Borromeo played a prominent role in organising the public health response, combining secular and religious care to galvanise the Milanese public health strategy and fight the disease. Borromeo organised three processions in October 1576 (Jones, 2005, pp 68\u201370). As in Venice, one of the most powerful, important relics belonging to the city was deployed \u2013 a fragment of the Holy Nail \u2013 which was carried in procession around the city. Participants in these elaborate processions sang hymns and litanies as they walked through infected streets, involving whole communities in the event. As David Garrioch has argued \u2018participation in religious services and processions marked by bells and singing helped shape a spiritual community that was also a local one\u2019 (Garrioch, 2005, p 15). These processions reinforced the bonds of a local spiritual community while invoking powerful, saintly intercessors to rid the community of disease. Hymn sheets or pamphlets were printed to be carried while on procession (Chiu, 2017, p 105). Remi Chiu argues that the call-and-response structure of the litany was a useful musical tool that established \u2018concord among the discord of the body politic\u2019. Every member of the procession was indispensable to the success of the ritual. Further,\nas the penitents sing the litany on the march, they send out an audible pulse through the march group and provide an ambulatory rhythm that unites the participants. Weaving back and forth, the litany acts as a sonic thread that holds together the constituent parts of the processional body (Chiu, 2017, p 105).\nThe sonic link was not limited to those in the processional body. People quarantined in their homes could also see the procession, hear the music and prayers, perhaps smell the incense, and join in with singing as it moved through the city streets. During plague epidemics many social bonds were fractured, and so the familiar ritual of a procession in a landscape altered by crisis provided an important link between the sick and the healthy. The processions held in October 1576 were thought to have been so successful that a contemporary Milanese writer remarked they were the principle cause for the city\u2019s liberation from the plague as they helped to placate God\u2019s wrath against the Milanese (Cohn, 2010, p 287). The processions held in Venice and Milan unified secular authorities and religious groups in city-wide demonstrations of piety with the purpose of mitigating the effects of the disease."},

At that conference, I had just finished the session \u2018Planned Mobility: Political Transport Concepts in the 20th Century\u2019, which I had organised and chaired, when Bernhard Finn, curator of electrical collections at the National Museum of American History of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC, and Robert, back then curator of biosciences and head of life and communication technologies at the Science Museum in London, confronted me with a plan they had discussed since 1993: that the National Museum of American History, the Science Museum, and the Deutsches Museum, i.e. three of the world\u2019s greatest repositories of material heritage and the strongest museums in the field of science and technology, should join forces to develop research programmes and debates on how to value museum collections. A first meeting in connection with SHOT\u2019s next annual meeting at the Science Museum in London, which was scheduled for 1\u20134 August 1996, would bring together scholars from museums, universities and independent research institutions to explore new avenues in object-oriented historiography of science and technology. This idea perfectly fitted my own agenda to further develop the Deutsches Museum, Germany\u2019s national museum of science and technology and a Forschungsmuseum (research museum) by legal statute, as a both nationally and internationally leading institution for research on material culture. I enthusiastically responded and was strongly backed by both the Museum\u2019s Director-General and the scientific advisory board. Hence, Deutsches Museum became one of the drivers of Artefacts, the newly established research network, which held its first meeting in London on 30\u201331 July 1996. Thanks to Robert\u2019s skilful organisation and intellectual leadership, the meeting was immensely productive. Focused on the theme of medicine and health, it explored innovative concepts and approaches in using objects to research and communicate the history of techno-scientific cultures. In a joint effort of scholars from museums and academia, it also vividly evaluated the new permanent gallery Health Matters, which had opened at the Science Museum in 1994.\nMost important, however, was the consensus of all participants and museum stakeholders that such meetings should be continued and its results should be published. It was agreed that the next two meetings should be organised by the other two leaders of the Artefacts consortium, the National Museum of American History in Washington DC and the Deutsches Museum in Munich, and in doing so providing a momentum to the emerging network on studies on the material culture of science and technology. Thanks to Robert\u2019s leadership, the Science Museum volunteered to serve as the publishing arm of Artefacts. The Museum\u2019s publication department took over and managed to strike a contract with Harwood Academic Publishers. Volume 1 of the new series, which was named Artefacts: Studies in the History of Science and Technology, published the results of the London meeting and its title \u2018Manifesting Medicine\u2019 created a pattern of using alliterative titles that quickly developed into a signifying marker of the series (Bud, Finn and Trischler, 1999). Neither this volume nor any other books of the series that followed, however, were mere \u2018proceedings\u2019 of the Artefacts annual conferences. Rather, the meetings helped to explore if a chosen topic deserved treatment at length in a volume. With volume 7 of the series, the Smithsonian Institution Scholarly Press took over and since then has been in charge of publishing the output of the Artefacts network. Thanks to the splendid work of Martin Collins, curator of the civilian applications satellites collection of Smithsonian\u2019s National Air and Space Museum, as managing editor, the series has further gained in quality and with volume 11, which challenges the role of museum collections in the twenty-first century, it has developed into an open access series.[2]\nFollowing the meeting in London, a continuing series of 23 annual Artefacts conferences thus far held has spread across the world, stretching from Vienna to Oslo and from Ottawa to Philadelphia. Robert has participated in all of them, except the one in 2018 (splendidly organised by the Adler Planetarium in Chicago), when he was unfortunately hindered by health problems. In the community, he is widely recognised for his reputation as a most engaged discussant, whose scholarly creativity and intellectual versatility contributed greatly to the stimulating working culture of Artefacts.Not all of the high-flying goals that the individual and institutional founders had in mind when setting up Artefacts in the mid-1990s have been fully achieved thus far. The objective to collectively create patterns of elaborated peer reviewing of exhibitions, for example, is still pending, to be honest, despite the efforts of a number of journals in the field of history of science and technology. SHOT\u2019s flagship Technology &amp; Culture has recently published a couple of excellent exhibition reviews such as the ones on special exhibitions at the Science Museum and the Deutsches Museum by Johannes-Geert Hagmann (2014) and Finn Arne J\u00f8rgensen and Dolly J\u00f8rgensen (2016). Such fine-grained and detailed reviews can serve as role models for an in-depth evaluation of museum exhibitions as products and generators of scholarship.The goal, however, to profile Artefacts as a forum to discuss the scholarly status and value of exhibitions as scientific enterprises has always been high up on the agenda. Hence, it doesn\u2019t come as a surprise that it was Robert who gave the keynote speech when in 2008 the Deutsches Museum, jointly with the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science, held a conference with exactly that target: to rethink collecting and exhibiting as scholarly enterprises (Bud, 2010). Robert and I have always been brothers in spirit to ensure an indissoluble bond between researching, collecting and exhibiting in museums of science and technology in the sense that research generates exhibitions which in turn generate research. Moreover, we both share the deep conviction that exhibitions not only visualise results of scholarly works, but produce new knowledge by posing innovative research questions that interrogate the epistemic quality of artefacts."},

When these expectations were not realised, there was a perception that graphene had failed to live up to expectations (Colapinto, 2014). The Wonder Materials content team were wary of contributing to the unrealistic expectations heaped on graphene. The aim of Wonder Materials was to go beyond product-focused expectation and subsequent narratives of perceived disappointment and instead focus on the inspiration and wonder that comes with an exciting new area of scientific exploration. The content team were inspired by the curiosity and playfulness in Geim and Novoselov\u2019s scientific approach and decided that this would set the tone for presentation and interpretation of graphene in the exhibition. This approach resonated with our intention to follow the recent cultural \u2018shift in focus from science as a finished product to science as a continuous process \u2013 science in the making\u2019 (Filippoupoliti, 2010, p 21).No object in the exhibition captures Geim and Novoselov\u2019s approach better than an ordinary sticky tape dispenser. We made this the first object visitors encountered on entering the exhibition, displayed alongside two replica Nobel medals. The contrast between these items creates provocative dissonance. The juxtaposition of these objects \u2013 one cheap, mass produced and mundane, the others gold-plated and a famous mark of the highest level of achievement \u2013 is intended to spark curiosity. The placement of the sticky tape dispenser alongside these famous symbols of recognition and achievement visually illustrates the extraordinary origin story of graphene. When developing the content for Wonder Materials, we were wary of falling back on a traditional hagiographic narrative. Instead we decided to display these objects together to introduce the story of how a curious, playful approach led to the highest honour in science."},

In 2019, a widely circulated photograph showed a different version of Mount Everest, as it depicted numerous mountaineers queuing to stand at the summit of the mountain.[1] This photograph of rush-hour traffic on Everest spurred on calls for more control over the number of people who are allowed to visit the site, in order to counter what some referred to as \u2018adventure tourism\u2019 on the mountain (Beaumont, 2019). It seemed to indicate that the influx of visitors were spoiling what had up until then been a natural site where expert mountaineers could challenge nature and themselves, and that past explorers had somehow been more deserving or authentic in their endeavours. This notion is predicated on the idea that mountaineering and exploration had once been acts of solitude, something which Vanessa Heggie masterfully shows has had enduring consequences\u00a0 \u0336\u00a0 not only for our understanding of the history of science and exploration, but for the relationship between the laboratory and the field.\nAs a study of extremes, Higher and Colder links to broad historiographies of exploration studies and the history of (bio)medicine; areas where historians have often chosen to focus either on the laboratory or the field, or have identified a conflict between the two. Heggie takes fieldwork \u2018out of the shadow of the laboratory\u2019, while also highlighting the functional relationship rather than the conflict between the laboratory and field. The focus on extreme physiology is particularly fruitful for such an approach. As Heggie notes, the history of biomedicine has traditionally been told as a story of big science and the laboratory, overlooking the significance not only of field-research but of the way practitioners moved between the \u2018lab\u2019 and the \u2018field\u2019. As Heggie shows, however, those who were interested in extreme physiology, including both research into what happened to the human body in extreme environments and how to expand the limits of human physical achievements, carried out research both \u2018on the mountain\u2019 and \u2018in the laboratory\u2019. Indeed, the boundary between the two was highly fluid, something which is particularly clear in Chapter 2, \u2018Gasping Lungs\u2019, which focuses on research into altitude sickness and the barometric chamber. The historiographical point about the relationship between the laboratory and the field underpins the entire book, which is organised around six thematic sections, and introduces us to a wide range of historical actors, including Sherpas, university researchers and career-explorers.\nThe reconsideration of the relationship between the field and the laboratory helps to showcase what was so often excluded in scientific research papers: embodied knowledge and informal networks of knowledge exchange. It was frequently the case that official expedition reports erased or excluded data on organisational and practical aspects of mountain climbing; information which would have been highly significant for future expeditions. Instead, this knowledge was transferred via more informal methods. Chapter 3, \u2018Frozen Fields\u2019, looks at the gate-keeping of expeditions, and shows how the transfer of knowledge through specific networks also excluded others, in particular those who were not considered a \u2018good chap\u2019, i.e. a very specific type of white male. Indigenous peoples, whose labour and knowledge was central to the success of expeditions was one such group. Another group was women explorers and scientists; although, as Heggie notes, this did not mean that women were not part of the research or the expeditions. The inherent biases in what is considered the \u2018normal\u2019 body and body state is further developed in Chapter 5, \u2018Blood on the Mountain\u2019, which considers the violent history of polycythemia studies. Throughout the book, Heggie shows that the racialised and gendered assumptions prevalent in physiological research are not limited to the past, but should be a real concern for contemporary researchers as well.\nHigher and Colder draws on a range of sources, including non-textual material objects. This is executed well through the book, and in particular in Chapter 4 where Heggie uses the history of pemmican to interrogate embodied knowledge. Just as clothing could be symbolic (shown in Chapter 3) and link the explorer to a specific tradition of research, so too could food. Choosing what food to bring on expeditions was also about signal-value. In the twentieth century, use of pemmican on Arctic expeditions signified that you were an \u2018old-school\u2019 and hardy explorer. As Heggie writes, \u2018This story arch, from indigenous knowledge to re-appropriated imperial science to traditional marker of a lost, robust, masculine past, can be found in many technologies of survival, and it described, I argue, a form of bioprospecting\u2019\u00a0(Heggie, 2019, p 93). Bioprospecting, as this quote indicates, is taken to mean extraction of biological resources, as well as extraction of knowledge. Heggie\u2019s version of bioprospecting is a superb concept for thinking about the many ways in which people have tried to push the boundaries of human physiology.\nHigher and Colder is an excellent and well-written book, which will be of great value to anyone interested in exploration and medical research, as well as the material culture of science more generally. My only criticism is that I would have liked more focused examinations of some of the key examples in the text. Higher and Colder covers a lot of ground, and I felt that the importance of some of the examples was not fully expounded. That being said, I would be surprised if the wealth of examples in Higher and Colder did not inspire a lot of new research projects in the future. No doubt, Heggie\u2019s book will become a staple work for historians to use in the years to come."},

The challenges of displaying information and communication technologies", "issue": "Spring 2015, Communications", "keywords": [], "tags": ["History of technology", "History of communications", "Science and society", "Exhibitions", "Curating", "Science museums"], "text": "The first challenge for a gallery on the Information Age was that the concept itself is loose and open, used in many different disciplines, in many different ways. For those from a science and electrical engineering background the idea of information has a very specific meaning \u2013 a unit of information or binary digit forming a \u2018bit\u2019 that can be quantified and shared between a transmitter and receiver. But for the social sciences, in particular sociologists, the idea of an information age \u2013 a society brought about by new information and communication technologies \u2013 is a complex and multifaceted one that has caused much debate and discussion since it came to the fore in the 1970s. \nThe concept was perhaps first alluded to by John Stuart Mill (1806\u201373) in The Spirit of the Age (1831). Here Mill suggested that progress was not due to an increase in knowledge or the discoveries of science, but due in part to the distribution and sharing of knowledge in society:\nMen may not reason, better, concerning the great questions in which human nature is interested, but they reason more. Large subjects are discussed more, and longer, and by more minds. Discussion has penetrated deeper into society; and if greater numbers than before have attained the higher degrees of intelligence, fewer grovel in that state of abject stupidity, which can only co-exist with utter apathy and sluggishness. (Mill, 1831 in\u00a0Himmelfarb, p 56)\nAlthough not driven by a sense of technological progress, Mill\u2019s notion of knowledge distribution came at a time of rapid industrialisation. During the nineteenth century there was a vast growth in the need to process information. The development of the insurance and banking industries, alongside the creation of a complex national and international telegraph network, brought with it a new reliance on the transfer and sharing of information, and a new era for the information machine (Campbell-Kelly and Aspray, 2004). At first much of the calculation and record keeping was done by people, then known as \u2018computers\u2019. These were clerks that calculated the numbers by hand, later using mechanical desk calculators such as comptometers. But the rapid increase in the volume of information needing to be processed and stored required a new type of machine that could cope with all this information at an industrial scale.\u00a0Help came at the end of the nineteenth century in the form of Hollerith\u2019s punched card machines. Hermann Hollerith (1860\u20131929) devised a series of these electromechanical sorters and tabulators which could rapidly count and store the digital information held on thousands of individual punched cards. The devices were rapidly adopted for numerous purposes, from calculating the census to payroll and structural engineering. They would go on to lay the foundations for our information processing industries.\nAlthough the idea of a society defined through the transfer of information has its roots firmly in the nineteenth century, it wasn't until the twentieth century that the concept of an information society became a central feature of much discussion in scientific and sociological literature. Perhaps most notably, the mathematician and engineer Claude Shannon defined information theory and gave it a mathematical underpinning with his seminal paper 'A Mathematical Theory of Communication' (Shannon, 1948). In this article Shannon looked at how to send messages electrically, through a process of encryption and transmission. He argued that from an electrical engineer and a mathematician\u2019s perspective the semantic meaning of the communication being transmitted was not important. Instead the focus should be on the selection of material to be sent. Shannon showed how communication could be determined mathematically by focusing on the transmission of a signal between sender and receiver, through a channel. For Shannon all channels contain noise, or error, and the challenge for an engineer was to reduce the ratio of the noise in relation to the signal, whilst working within the capacity of the channel. He developed the idea of entropy in information, as a way of measuring the amount of uncertainty in a message. Similarly, his idea of redundancy provided a way of looking at the predictability of the information carried. For instance, if a letter was predictable it was redundant, and therefore didn't need to be carried through a channel.\nAt first Shannon's ideas did not find much traction (Gleick, 2011, pp 233\u201344), but later their relevance was identified in areas such as cryptography and compression, and more broadly in science and engineering. By the 1950s information theory even found purchase with linguists, biologists, psychologists, social scientists and visual artists (Eames and Eames, 1953), who picked up on the relevance of the concept to human cognition and personal communication. Shannon himself cautioned that information theory was becoming a \u2018bandwagon\u2019 and suggested that 'it has perhaps been ballooned to an importance beyond its actual accomplishments' (1956, p 3). Despite these concerns, his theory still forms the basis for the compression and transmission of all digital information today.\nAs well as being tackled mathematically, the concept of a new age of information was also brought to the attention of social scientists and economists by the sociologist Daniel Bell. The idea of a post-industrial society was expressed in his book The Coming of Post-Industrial Society (1973) where Bell argued that the Western World was moving towards a service economy and away from a production economy, later coining the concept 'the information society'. Critics of his argument maintained that nothing had changed and that this state is just a natural extension of capitalism, as society moves towards the production of goods and services that are desired rather than required.\nMore recently the idea of an information age, underpinned by the creation of new technical networks, was put forward by Castells, who argued that information is the basis for productivity and power, enabling existing power structures to maintain control, with the relationship between capitalism and technology one of mutual reinforcement:\nThe rise of the network society\u2026cannot be understood without the interaction between these two relatively autonomous trends: development of new information technologies, and the old society\u2019s attempt to retool itself by using the power of technology to serve the technology of power. (Castells, 1996, p 52)\nWhilst acknowledging the maintenance of existing power structures, both Bell and Castells' sociological accounts imply a discontinuity with previous forms of society and economy. Webster (2006) suggests they fail to acknowledge the continuity that exists within different periods of capitalism, or that the technological networks of the nineteenth, twentieth and twenty-first centuries (broadly construed as people, organisations and technologies) contain similarities and coherence.\nIt was for this reason that we wanted to examine the historical form of such change in the gallery, enabling visitors to question whether they really are living in a new information age, or whether many of the structures of society and technological networks have\u00a0similarities to those that came before.\u00a0"},

One object selected as a centre piece for the new space is the Giustiniani Medicine Chest, believed to have been manufactured in the mid-sixteenth century. It gains its name from the Giustiniani family, who are credited as its original commissioners and owners. This identification has been accepted as part of its current cataloguing, within the Science Museum Wellcome Collection, due to its purchase directly from members of the Giustiniani family as well as internal and external motifs derived from the family coat of arms. Previous research and publications focusing on the object have discussed its medicinal contents and construction. There has been very little consideration of provenance. I would therefore like to address this omission within this article.\nThe chest is part of the Wellcome Collection of medical objects which was originally founded by Sir Henry Solomon Wellcome FRS (1853\u20131936). He made his fortune from pharmaceutical development and, as money was plentiful and his interest in the subject of health was extensive, he began to piece together an extensive collection of artefacts illustrating human health and medical treatment from different ages and continents. His holdings became so extensive that he opened a public museum, first in Wigmore Street and then in Euston, central London. Eventually, even this space was insufficient to contain the collection and so after his death some of the artefacts were moved on a long-term loan to the Science Museum. An exploration of the acquisition paperwork for the object, held within the Wellcome Collection archives, clearly illustrates how artefacts brought into museum collections by early twentieth century collectors arrived with a well-developed history. This narrative added a veneer of romance to the object and subsequently increased its desirability for museum purchase. For agents who were working on a retainer, or commission, generating interest in an artefact ensured continued employment and income through subsequent sales; it was therefore an essential skill. In the case of the Wellcome Collection, agents, based around the world, regularly provided a bulletin regarding material of interest which was either on the open market or belonged to a private owner who may be induced to sell. Before the advent of cheap and easily available photographic images, encouragement for a museum to outlay the purchase cost of an item was generated through the agent\u2019s ability to create interest in an artefact through a written description. This was undertaken through the relation of the history of the artefact which had been researched and generated by the agent. In the case of this particular medicine chest, when the story provided by the purchasing agent is linked to the known facts of the Giustiniani family, the supplied narrative begins to break down. Does this therefore make the narrative wholly redundant or does the story of the chest\u2019s purchase by an agent and subsequent transportation from Italy to the UK indicate a new narrative which is as much part of the article\u2019s heritage as anything which happened to it in the early modern period? Can museums exploit this more recent history in an effort to make objects more accessible and to prompt questions from visitors regarding provenance and the ethics of collecting?\nThe Giustiniani Medicine Chest has been part of the Wellcome Collection since 1924, residing first at the Henry Wellcome exhibition and then moving, in 1946, to the Science Museum, London. Within the Science Museum the chest is catalogued as being Genoese and dating from 1562\u20131566 (Science Museum, A641515, on-line). It was sourced for the collection by Dr Carlo Rossi, an agent for the Wellcome Museum based in Italy, on behalf of the curator of the collection, Dr C J S Thompson. Rossi purchased it from a branch of the Giustiniani family based in Serravallo near Norcia, 40 miles south east of Perugia (Rossi, 16 March 1924, unpublished correspondence). The purchase price was 10,500 lire, which is approximately \u00a3416 at the 1924 exchange rate[1] (Rossi, 16 March 1924, unpublished correspondence). The chest was packed by Cook\u2019s Agency on 15 March 1924, ready for dispatch to London (Rossi, 23 November 1924, unpublished correspondence). The item\u2019s provenance, which Rossi relates in one of his letters to Thompson, identifies the chest as originally \u2018with no doubt\u2019, being in the ownership of Vincenzo or Cencio Giustiniani who was the \u2018governor or King of Scio [the island of Chios] from 1546 to 1560\u2019 (Rossi, 23 November 1924, unpublished correspondence). How much of the provenance information in the letter is oral history gained from the vendor and how much is a result of additional research by Rossi is unclear, but it does make a romantic story for the origins of the chest. Unfortunately it appears to be factually incorrect on certain points. Oral history passed down from generation to generation can be misleading, and in this case whilst the chest may have belonged to a Giustiniani who was a distant relative of the vendors, who still bore the family name, there appear to be flaws in this particular history posited for a specific owner of the chest.\nChios, where the chest\u2019s original owner apparently resided, is the fifth largest Greek island, situated in the Aegean Sea, seven miles from the Anatolian coast. The prevalence of the name Giustiniani on the island is a direct result of the formation of the Chios trading company by individuals from Genoa in 1157. This was termed the Maona di Chio e di Focea and was undertaken by twelve Genoese patricians from a variety of families. They made a pact to act, in trading and life, on the island, as if \u2018they were born from the same father and the same mother\u2019 (Giustiniani, a, on-line). To facilitate this and obliterate any lingering family loyalty to their birth families back in Italy the group eschewed their own family names in favour of adopting the joint surname of \u2018Giustiniani\u2019 (Giustiniani, a, on-line). The name Vincenzo Giustiniani is extremely common as a result and, whilst the item in question may have been owned by a \u2018Vincenzo Giustiniani\u2019, it may well not have been the one who has been termed the \u2018governor or King\u2019 of Chios by Rossi (Rossi, 23 November 1924, unpublished correspondence). When creating an enticing narrative for an item, it is only human to want to identify the most illustrious forebear when creating a family history for objects and this is what may have occurred here, with the highest ranking Giustiniani on Chios being chosen as the chest\u2019s owner.\nWhilst Rossi refers to the title of the administrator of Chios as \u2018King\u2019, the most commonly used term in documentation of the early modern period is that of podest\u00e0 (Rossi, 23 November 1924, unpublished correspondence). Each of the twelve branches of the Giustiniani family had a role in nominating a man from the family for this role who would serve for a fixed length of time to govern their affairs. John Burnett, in the most comprehensive review of the chest\u2019s history and contents to date, acknowledges that there is the capacity for confusion regarding the ownership of the chest. He warns that the chest\u2019s owner Vincenzo Giustiniani should not be confused with \u2018his kinsman and contemporary, Cardinal Vincenzo Giustiniani\u2019, who was born on Chios on the 28 August 1519, became Master General of the Dominican Order, and died in Rome on 28 October 1582 (Burnett, 1982, p 325). Burnett\u2019s Vincenzo died in 1570 (Burnett, 1982, p 325). A more plausible candidate for ownership is identifiable in the work of Kenneth Michael Setton, in his work The Papacy and the Levant, 1204\u20131571. He identifies a Marchese Vincenzo Giustiniani whom he indicates was the last podest\u00e0 of Chios and who served for four years in the role from 1562 to 1566 (Setton, 1984, p 893 and p 895). If the chest did belong to a podest\u00e0 of this name then this may well be the correct individual. Rossi states that his podest\u00e0 ruled on behalf of the family for fourteen years, from 1546 through to 1560, but this is probably incorrect as the role was normally only held for a term of three years (Giustiniani, 1943, p xx). The Vincenzo awarded the office in 1562 may, however, have held it a year longer than normal in order to address a difficult situation which the island faced in 1566 when the Ottoman Turks challenged the Genoese for ownership of the island (Setton, 1984, p 893 and p 895).\u00a0The role of the podest\u00e0 was to oversee the collection of taxes on the island which were then invested in the infrastructure of the families\u2019 company, to purchase ships for trade and ensure that the island and port was defended and remained a Genoese outpost. He was also responsible for ensuring the payment of the annual fee to the Turks for use of the island (Setton, 1984, p 894). This agreement was originally negotiated on 8 June 1363, with the Emperor of Byzantium, John V Paleologos (1332\u20131391), who granted the island to the Giustiniani family in return for an annual payment of 500 gold hyperpera (Giustiniani, 1943, p x). The payment of this annual fee was not always straightforward. According to a letter from a patriarch of the Giustiniani to the Genoese government which was written sometime after March 1567, in a previous year the Gran Vizier, Mehmed Sokolli, required the family to pay the tribute due to the Ottoman court twice. This was \u2018because he [Sokolli] had ordered the treasurer at the Porte to withhold their receipt for payment\u2019 (Setton, 1984, p 894). This figure was then raised to three years\u2019 back payment after the Giustiniani protested at the injustice. The perceived default on this payment to the Ottoman Turks from the Giustiniani was ostensibly the reason why the Turks retook the island on the 14 April 1566.\nAt the time of the invasion when the Turks deposed the Giustiniani, Rossi identifies that:\nThis CENCIO [Vincenzo] GIUSTINIANI was sent as a prisoner to Caffa by the Turks and was freed after having taken part, as it was believed, in the battle of Lepanto (Rossi, 23 November 1924, unpublished correspondence).\nSetton, in writing about the Vincenzo whose career he followed, confirms Rossi\u2019s claims that after the Turks resumed control of the island the \u2018lives of the podest\u00e0 and the twelve governatori mahonesi\u2019 were to be spared but \u2018Sultan Suleiman\u2019 (Suleiman the Magnificent, 1494\u20131566) \u2018stressed that they must \u201cgo into exile\u201d, which would soon mean confinement at Caffa\u2019[2] (Setton, 1984, p 897). If Burnett\u2019s date of death for Vincenzo of 1570 is correct then this individual cannot be the same as the one identified by Rossi, as the battle of Lepanto, which Rossi\u2019s Vincenzo was part of, took place on 7 October 1571 (Burnett, 1982, p 325). Here it seems likely that, over the years through retelling and embroidery, a major international event has been grafted onto the provenance story of the chest. It has been estimated by Angus Konstam that there were up to 37,000 slaves utilized as oarsmen by the Turks in this battle (Konstam, 2003, pp 20\u201321). The majority of these were Christians who had been captured in previous attacks and conquests outside of Turkish held lands. If Vincenzo had been a slave at this point, owned by the Turks, he would in all probability have been manning the oars of a galley in this battle and his survival would not have been guaranteed. Rossi, however, indicates that he did indeed survive and became a free man again.\nSetton does not mention the possibility of Vincenzo\u2019s inclusion in Lepanto but instead states that he and his compatriots were held for nearly a year at Caffa, before they were released after the intercession of the French ambassador, Monsieur de Grantrie de Grandchamp (see Guilmartin, 1974, pp 222\u2013225). There is a Hieronimo Giustiniani who wrote a History of the Island of Chios in 1586 and Philip Argenti, a twentieth-century historian of Chios who edited the 1943 edition, claims that this is Vincenzo the podest\u00e0\u2019s son (Giustiniani, 1943, p x). According to Hieronimo, Vincenzo ended up in France serving Charles IX (1550\u20131574). He was elevated to the role of \u2018Knight of the Order\u2019 of Charles IX, and then joined the \u2018Council of State\u2019 and the \u2018Privy Council\u2019 (Giustiniani, 1943, p x). Ironically, if this is the same Vincenzo who was held in chains by the Turks, he was then made \u2018Ambassador Extraordinary to the Sultan Selim, the Great Lord of Constantinople\u2019 (Selim II, 1524\u20131574) and so ended up negotiating once again with the Turks and living in Turkish controlled lands (Giustiniani, 1943, p x). To further confuse the identity of the Giustiniani being discussed, Argenti does not indicate that this podest\u00e0 Vincenzo was taken captive from Chios to Caffa, but that he was responsible for negotiating the captives\u2019 release. With the above in mind an attempt to reconstruct the original ownership of the chest and attribute its purchase and use by one specific member of the Giustiniani family seems to be a fruitless endeavour. It is unlikely to be made any more accurate unless additional documentation, specifically referring to the chest, is discovered and this is unlikely as the Giustiniani archives were destroyed when the Turks retook Chios.\nWhilst the lack of accurate family history of the Giustiniani hampers the identification of a definitive Vincenzo as owner of the chest there is no doubt, when the chest itself is examined, that this is a high status, high cost object. The fact that it did have links with the Giustiniani and the island of Chios is confirmed by an object contained in the lower level of the chest in the middle drawer, a gold covered box containing plasters which fits its storage space exactly. It has a coat of arms on top which Burnett states is \u2018an adaptation of the arms of the Giustiniani of Chios as described by Crollalanza\u2019.[3] The arms have a black spread eagle, with wings and legs outstretched in the top half of the device, with a crown free floating over the eagle\u2019s head and a castle tower taking up the lower half of the lid space. Burnett claims that the depiction of the arms on this box is specifically that of the Giustiniani of Chios, which is \u2018distinct from those of the Giustiniani of Pesaro or Venice\u2019 (Burnett, 1982, p 327). As a result he claims that the box has a manufacture date of \u20181566 or earlier\u2019, assuming that the Chios arms were not used by the Giustiniani family after the Turk invasion (Burnett, 1982, p 327). As a result of this information the Science Museum has decided, in its description of the article, to adopt a very specific construction date for the chest of between 1562 and 1566 (Science Museum, A641515, on-line). This new date, when cross referenced with the original narrative of the Vincenzo\u2019s of the Giustiniani family, serves to further exclude certain potential owners from the timeline that was explored with regards to the chest\u2019s provenance. In addition to the coat of arms on the box the interior of the chest also contains additional spread eagle motifs in the middle drawer on two semi-circular recess covers situated at each end of the chest. These emblazoned items, as with the free standing plaster box, could be later interpolations onto and into the structure of the chest. The compartment lids are attached to the carcass using hinges whilst the plaster box is a loose structure which fits into a compartment and can be removed, thus the coat of arms could indicate not the original owner but a subsequent one. However, spread eagle motifs are also present on the carved external feet of the chest which are a more intrinsic part of the structure of the chest\u2019s carcass and are more likely to be contemporary with the original construction of the chest.\nThe Science Museum catalogues the chest at present as being \u2018Genoese\u2019. I am unable to find any documented reference to this and can only assume that this is claimed since the Giustiniani family originated from Genoa (Science Museum, A641515, on-line). However, Rossi identifies the chest as being \u2018Venetian\u2019 in construction, and also states that it is \u2018certainly of the last half of the 16th century\u2019 post-dating the claimed construction timeline established by Burnett (Rossi, 23 November 1924, unpublished correspondence). However, his reasons for this claim are not given and so cannot be verified. Confirmation that this is an Italian piece is provided by Burnett who, having consulted the V&amp;A Furniture department, identifies the design of the handles, one on each side of the chest, as \u2018almost identical to one in the Victoria and Albert Museum, which is also Italian and dates from the first half of the sixteenth century\u2019 (Burnett, 1982, p 236). They are beautifully cast with female heads in their centre and a dolphin on each side, whose tails attach to the body of the chest. The chest, together with its contents, weighs in at 37.5kg and the design of these handles makes it clear that they were not created as the main method of moving the chest. Any handling would require two people and significant team work made easier by larger and more substantial handle construction. Burnett also gains a date for the design of the \u2018single-warded lock\u2019 which is similar to others in the V&amp;A collection and which he claims backs up the dating from the coat of arms giving a \u2018consistent [..] date of 1560\u201370\u2019 for the object (Burnett, 1982, p 236).\nOne question which has never been considered is: if the chest was resident on Chios, with the podest\u00e0 or one of his extended family, when the island was regained by the Turks, how did it find its way back to a lesser branch of the family in Italy where it was tracked down and purchased by Rossi in Perugia in 1924? If the chest were on the Island of Chios when it was taken by the Turks it is doubtful that its Giustiniani owner would have been able to take it with them on leaving. This is because the Turks, on reoccupying the island, instructed the elite population to ransom themselves by paying \u2018a thousand, or at least five hundred, ducats apiece\u2019 (Setton, 1984, p 898). To raise the money they had to arrange \u2018\u201csales\u201d of their houses, gardens, and vineyards to Piali\u2019, the admiral of the Turkish fleet and it is therefore unlikely that high status goods within each property would be released to the original owners. Instead they may well have had to have been sacrificed to make up this ransom (Setton, 1984, p 898). If individuals were allowed to take a selection of personal items with them on quitting the island then, bearing in mind the weight of the Giustiniani chest, moving the chest would be a challenge, especially in a post-invasion evacuation scenario. The chances are that, due to these pressures of invasion, if the chest was resident on the island then the chances of it returning to Italy and still residing within the Giustiniani family as late as 1924 would be extremely slim.\nHowever, it did end up back in Italy and the reason for this could be linked with the terminology which Rossi uses to describe it in one of the letters to Thompson. He uses the phrase \u2018naval medicine chest\u2019; underlining the term to indicate that it is important (Rossi, 23 November 1924, unpublished correspondence). This description, together with its weight and large dimensions, indicates that the chest may plausibly have been resident on board one of the Giustiniani ships. In this way it would have found its way back to Italy, and stayed within the Giustiniani family, being inherited through the generations until it was eventually sold to Rossi. The Giustiniani family owned a fleet of ships which enabled them to control the export and trade of a natural medicinal remedy grown only on Chios: the gum of the mastic tree. This lucrative trade meant a regular transportation route from the island to Genoa and other Italian ports. As a ship travelling this route would cover over 1,200 nautical miles, having medical treatment permanently stocked on a ship would be eminently sensible. Argenti indicates that as well as the trade route back to Italy the connection between \u2018the Giustiniani resident in Chios and those in Genoa [\u2026] continued to be close\u2019 (Giustiniani, 1943, p xx). This was because the families resident on Chios regularly returned their children to Italy to undertake \u2018their education\u2019 (Giustiniani, 1943, p xx). The provision of medical treatment contained within the chest, for administration to the valuable children of the elite Giustiniani, would therefore be both understandable and desirable.\nWhatever environment the chest was used in, and however it arrived in the ownership of the Giustiniani family in Italy, the construction and finish of the object indicate that this is a high status, high cost object. The lack of chipping and wearing, other than aging, of the gilding on the highly carved feet of the chest also confirm that this elite item has been cared for and was a prestige object to be looked after rather than stood on potentially damaging surfaces or mistreated.[4] Its exterior is covered in leather which, as Thomasin Summerford points out, was originally stained red to match the un-faded red velvet interior where bottles and boxes containing expensive medicinal material are securely held in individual cells to guard against breakages during transportation (Summerford, 3 May 2011, unpublished dissertation, p 90). Whilst this is a well-crafted and attractive object this is not a piece of furniture or a conversation piece. The materia medica, plant, animal and mineral ingredients from which medicinal cures can be created are really what is special about this object and why it was created for its original owner. It is very easy to be distracted by the object itself and assess it solely on its external value as an early modern piece of furniture. However, it is significant that its contents were more costly than the carcass, which merely acts to safeguard the expensive desiccated medicinal compounds and ensure that they are kept dry and secure.\nMy research work so far on the object in question, together with its ancillary paperwork, has demonstrated that it may be impossible to establish a solid provenance for the chest. It undoubtedly has connections with the Giustiniani family, but whether it was commissioned by them and remained in their unbroken ownership between the 1500s and 1924 cannot be ascertained. The coat of arms of the family may well have been later interpolations and the narrative concerning the Giustiniani ownership which has been created around the object is not strictly accurate. However, in exploring the possible origination of the chest the existence of stories of potential ownership clearly demonstrate the need by those in contact with it to set it within a wider context. These stories attempt to link the item to significant events and personalities and consequently serve in an attempt to affirm its status as a precious object, rather than just a repository for expensive and essential medical treatments. These narratives also help to ensure that, despite the fact that its contents are no longer viable as medicinal treatments and have not been for some time, the item has been cared for and given enough prestige to gain a place in a national museum collection.\n\u00a0\nAcknowledgments:\nThanks are due to the staff of the Science Museum Library, Wellcome Library and British Library, London for their help in identifying material during the research phase.

Such an approach builds on the aforementioned revisionist histories of women in the nineteenth century that have sought, as Kathryn Gleadle describes it, \u2018to understand how women themselves interpreted, judged and perceived their capabilities\u2019 (Gleadle, 2017, p 5). These new histories have looked for evidence of how women have overcome barriers to find means for their own \u2018assertion and fulfilment\u2019 (ibid). A pivotal source for such an approach, providing biographical information and illustrating her engineering achievements and her commitment to continuing her father\u2019s work, is the pamphlet written by Vansittart herself, titled The History of the Lowe-Vansittart Propeller and a short extract of the life of the late Mr James Lowe, the successful inventor of screw ships from their first introduction. This small book was published in 1882 (one year before her death) by Jas Wade in London and sold for six pence. A copy of the pamphlet was gifted to the Science Museum by R B Prosser and is accessible via the Science Museum Library.[6] The pamphlet contains a transcript of the paper Vansittart delivered to the London Association of Foremen Engineers and Draughtsmen on 1 April 1876, as well as two shorter public orations she gave, testimonies about the Lowe-Vansittart propeller, a copy of its patent information, and correspondence.The pamphlet contains much of what is known about Vansittart\u2019s life, including the only verified image of her (see Figure 2).[7] There are certain inaccuracies in it; for example, Vansittart claims she is born seven years later than she was (her real birth date is shown in census data). The pamphlet is written by Vansittart herself, so should be treated with caution \u2013 it is her own version of her father\u2019s work, her work, and her life, so we have to interrogate her motives as its \u2018narrator\u2019. However, this is also what makes it so fascinating; it is her own narrative on her legacy as an engineer.Newspaper archives have also proved a useful means to trace Vansittart\u2019s work and provide evidence of the discourse around it. Seven reports were made on the Lowe-Vansittart propeller and its trials in The Times newspaper in the \u2018Naval and Military Intelligence\u2019 section between 1869 and 1873. These newspaper reports provide evidence of the ways Vansittart\u2019s engineering work was received and recorded and they help to verify the claims she makes in the pamphlet about the propeller\u2019s success. Contemporary engineering literature \u2013 such as the Society of Engineers journal \u2013 and catalogues from museums and exhibitions provide further insight into the reach of Vansittart\u2019s work. The literature, in particular, helps to show how the Lowe-Vansittart propeller was situated in contemporary debates about means of ship propulsion.The surviving letters that she sent to her lover Edward Bulwer-Lytton, held in the Bulwer-Lytton archives at the Hertfordshire County Council Archives, offer a different insight into Vansittart\u2019s life.[8] These tell us about her personal life, offering another layer of information about her personality, her motivations, and the way she expressed herself. Content from the letters also provides contextual information on her work as an engineer and the ways she financed those endeavours. Additionally, it was possible for the author to access Vansittart\u2019s notes from the Newcastle asylum \u2013 St Nicholas Hospital, Gosforth \u2013 where she died in 1883, from mania and anthrax, an infectious disease caused by bacteria.[9] Though these notes do not necessarily offer much insight into her life, they do confirm the tragic nature of her death and detail how she spent her last few months.[10]"},

The accompanying display board stated \u2018Leonardo systematically studied friction, which he considered would be important for the functioning of machines. This bench allowed him to experiment with the contact between different surfaces, by distinguishing between sliding and rolling.\u2019 The same exhibit had also been included in related exhibitions in Paris (Cit\u00e9 des Sciences et de l\u2019Industrie, 23 October 2012\u201318 August 2013), Munich (Deutsches Museum, 11 October 2013\u20133 August 2014) and S\u00e3o Paulo (Federa\u00e7\u00e3o das Ind\u00fastrias do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo, 11 November 2014\u201310 May 2015). It belongs, as did many of the other models on display in this loan exhibition, to the Museo Nazionale della Scienza e della Tecnologia \u2018Leonardo da Vinci\u2019 (MUST) in Milan where it has inventory number 392.\nThe exhibit consisted of four separate models, although these components all have the same MUST inventory number. The largest was the \u2018worktable\u2019, 1.88 m long, 0.81 m high and 0.85 m wide, which we shall call Model A. It supported at one end a rectangular wooden box attached to a string which passed over a cylinder (195 mm in diameter and 320 mm long) on an inclined plane to a hanging weight, and at the other end a horizontal cylinder (237 mm in diameter and 450 mm long) lying in a hemi-cylindrical cavity, again attached to a weight by a string. On the rear left corner of the table lay a wooden plank supporting a stack of shorter wooden blocks, of which one was attached to a long T-shaped handle. The view of these blocks is obscured in Figure 1(a) and they are not depicted in Figure 1(b). On the table also rested three separate devices: Models B, C and D. The models are all labelled in Figure 1(b). These four models were created by Canestrini for the major exhibition in Milan in 1953, \u2018Scienza e tecnica di Leonardo\u2019, and were subsequently donated to MUST where they form part of the permanent collection (Giorgione, 2015). Separate images of the four models are shown in Figure 2. All are based, with varying degrees of fidelity, on drawings contained in Leonardo\u2019s notebooks. Model A is based on sketches from folio 41r of Codex Arundel, which is reproduced in Figure 3. Models B, C and D are based on diagrams found on folio 11v of MS L of the Biblioth\u00e8que de l\u2019Institut de France (commonly referred to as \u2018Paris\u2019 manuscript L), shown in Figure 4.\nGiovanni Canestrini (1893\u20131975) had a long career as a motor racing journalist, and is famous as one of the founders of the Mille Miglia road race in 1926. He also wrote three substantial pieces on the contributions of Leonardo da Vinci to mechanics, particularly in the context of the development of the motor car. His first essay (Canestrini, 1938) was contained in a volume on the Italian contribution to the evolution and development of the motor vehicle, published by the Reale Automobile Club d\u2019Italia (RACI). It was a detailed account which showed familiarity with much of Leonardo\u2019s writing as well as evidence of wide reading of other sources, and despite the apparent narrowness of the chapter title (\u2018Leonardo da Vinci and the problems of locomotion\u2019) attempted to show that Leonardo\u2019s contributions had pre-dated and indeed informed the work of later inventors in many fields ranging from geometry and optics, to statics and dynamics, fluid mechanics and hydraulics, military engineering, mechanical devices, metalworking and other areas. In discussing Leonardo\u2019s studies on friction, Canestrini reproduced MS L f. 11v and identified it as showing \u2018studies of rolling friction\u2019[1], but while he quoted a statement about friction from Codex Arundel f. 41r[2], he did not reproduce any sketches from that folio.\nIn the following year Canestrini published two fuller accounts of Leonardo\u2019s work on friction. One (Canestrini, 1939a) was contained within a contribution entitled \u2018Leonardo\u2019s machines\u2019 in a collection of essays published in conjunction with the major exhibition of Leonardo\u2019s work and Italian invention held in Milan in 1939. The other (Canestrini, 1939b) was a book entitled \u2018Leonardo constructor of machines and vehicles\u2019 in which one of the three chapters was on \u2018Friction and traction\u2019. In both works Canestrini reproduced the whole of folio 41r of Codex Arundel. He wrote in the first \u2018Leonardo is the first who braved the systematic study of the causes of friction, both for the case of flat surfaces and for the case of axles, preceding by two centuries Amontons (1699) and Coulomb (1781), who reproduced, for his own experiments, the bench which we find drawn on folio 41r of Codex Arundel\u2019[3]. In the second the image of the folio was captioned \u2018bench for experiments on friction\u2019[4]. He also reproduced MS L f. 11v, describing it in the two publications as \u2018axles rotating on rollers\u2019[5] and \u2018studies on the friction in axles\u2019[6].\nAs discussed by Giorgione (2015), the first mechanical models to be based on Leonardo\u2019s drawings were constructed for exhibitions in Florence in 1929, and in Chicago in 1933. These few early models related to aeronautics and textile spinning. Subsequently around 200 models were created and exhibited in 1939, in the context of a major celebration of Italian invention in Milan which included an exhibition devoted to Leonardo da Vinci and was intended by the Fascist government to demonstrate Italian achievements and supremacy in technology[7]. Giovanni Canestrini was one of the engineers involved in designing these models, many of which were built by the RACI, which was heavily involved in organising the exhibition (Giorgione, 2015). Both the official guide to the 1939 exhibition (Guida, 1939) and the catalogue which was published after the exhibition (Catalogo, 1939) list two different models relating to friction displayed within the section on the \u2018mechanical arts\u2019: \u2018Reconstructed model of bench for experiments on sliding and rolling friction\u2019[8], and \u2018Reconstructed model of experimental apparatus for the study of the action of forces and friction in a rotary system\u2019[9]. The first of these was the precursor to Model A that Canestrini created for that exhibition (which we shall call Model A*). There are photographs of Model A* both in his book (Canestrini, 1939b), captioned \u2018reconstruction of bench for experiments on friction according to Leonardo\u2019s drawings\u2019,[10] and also in the exhibition catalogue (Catalogo, 1939) with the caption \u2018bench for experiments on sliding and rolling friction. Model reconstructed from Codex Arundel f. 41r\u2019[11]. Figure 5 shows one of these images. In all essential elements it was identical to Model A, although in Figure 5 the blocks and plank are arranged to show a block being pulled by its handle (just visible) down an inclined plane.\nThe second model was not illustrated in the exhibition guide or catalogue, but an image is to be found in Canestrini (1939b, p 160), shown here as Figure 6(a), with a caption that closely parallels the entries in both the exhibition guide and the catalogue: \u2018Reconstructed model \u2013 from drawing by Leonardo \u2013 for the study of the action of forces and friction in a rotary system\u2019[12]. This model, which we shall call Model E, is also shown in a leaflet advertising the exhibition (Leaflet, 1939) and depicted in Figure 6(b). The accompanying caption reads misleadingly \u2018Cylinder clutch\u2019 or more literally, \u2018Clutch made from cylindrical elements\u2019[13]. Model E was based on the sketch in the Codex Atlanticus (f. 1081v) shown in Figure 7, which Canestrini also reproduced in two of his publications. In Canestrini (1938) he described this diagram as \u2018thrust rollers in a drawing by Leonardo\u2019[14], while in Canestrini (1939a) it was a \u2018system of rotating bearings with thrust rollers on spindles\u2019[15].\nThere is no record in the catalogue or guide to the 1939 exhibition of any models similar to Models B, C or D, and we must therefore assume that these were created for the first time for the 1953 Milan event."},

It was Britain\u2019s first \u2018Great Exhibition\u2019 in thirteen years, mounted against a backdrop of the ravages of the First World War, and the shock of Spanish flu. It took place over two seasons, from April to October in 1924, and May to October in 1925. The BEE was one in a lineage of \u2018Great Exhibitions\u2019 in the UK, \u2018World\u2019s Fairs\u2019 in America, or \u2018Expositions Universelles\u2019 in France. Beginning with the London Great Exhibition of 1851, which sought to display the arts and industries of the world in a single site, these exhibitions were popular in the West and Japan, as well as in African and Asian colonies from 1851\u20131951 (Geppert, 2010, pp 1\u20138 ; Hoffenberg, 2001, pp 1\u201330). Like those before it, the BEE was a spectacular display of the people, products and cultures of the British Empire across a series of twenty-four museum-cum-arcade buildings called pavilions. Its distinction was in its status as a 'colonial exposition' \u2013 a sub-genre of the World\u2019s Fair, popular amongst imperial powers, in which only colonies were invited to participate. Exhibits were diverse, yet the official intent was largely unified: to increase inter-imperial trade and to promote the development of a more self-sufficient empire (British Empire Exhibition Official Guide, 1924). Its politician organisers, distrustful of European allies and rivals in the aftermath of the First World War, sought to direct increased attention towards its \u2018great, underdeveloped estate\u2019 and, in doing so, reduce the need for European trade.[3] It also wished to assert economic dominance in the face of increasing threats from the USA and Japan.[4] The colonies were considered essential in pursuing this goal, but were underfunded, and under-settled. The BEE provided an ideal stage upon which to present their natural and mineral wealth, employment opportunities, climate, or lifestyle. Curators of the African sections sought to steer public attention away from the gloomy but prevailing idea of the Dark Continent towards a more optimistic vision of 'Brightest Africa'. At the BEE, tropical Africa was not depicted as a region of savagery, death and disease, but a vibrant, exotic culture, and a land of infinite wealth for the intrepid British capitalist. Such depictions were aligned to the broader goals of promoting the development of resource colonies like the Gold Coast. The enduring prevalence of ideas of the White Man\u2019s Grave \u2013 implying that Europeans were racially incapable of surviving in tropical Africa \u2013 needed to be challenged, as these would have been a deterrent to even the most fearless industrialist.[5]The exhibition also arrived in a time of growing nationalism, pan-Africanism, and anti-imperial sentiments in Africa and the USA, with intellectuals like Marcus Garvey advocating the end of European colonialism and African leadership in Africa (Stephen 2013, p 123; Wintz 2015, pp 1\u201318). In many ways, the African exhibits can be read as a counter narrative to such pan-Africanism. By challenging the concept of White Man\u2019s Grave, curators attempted to suggest that Britain had rendered its African colonies healthy and productive, and their inhabitants disciplined, cooperative, and eager to work. How the tropical African exhibits attempted to pacify fears of the White Man\u2019s Grave, and how various visitors engaged with them, is the subject of the remainder of this paper."},

One of Babbage\u2019s passions was designing huge cogwheel-driven machines to process numbers by steam power: his Analytical Engine, had it been built, would have had most of the features of a multi-purpose programmable computer. Lovelace, his friend and collaborator, translated a French-language description of the planned Engine and published it in 1842 with a contribution of her own: officially just a set of \u2018Notes\u2019 to the translation, Lovelace\u2019s piece added far more detail, giving the reading public a clear description of what we would now call programming, and an elegant account of the new fields of enquiry which the machine might open up. Yet the project, though never entirely forgotten, had little or no influence on the computers which achieved the same goals using high-speed electronics in the 1940s. Nonetheless, as smaller, faster and cheaper machines reached into every area of twentieth-century life, first Babbage and then Lovelace gained a new prominence as early visionaries of the computer revolution. And then people started to write jokes about them.\nThe Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage arose almost entirely by accident. In 2009, Sydney Padua, an animator and occasional cartoonist, was asked to help out with material for Ada Lovelace Day, the annual celebration of women in technology. Padua put together a short graphical retelling of the standard Lovelace/Babbage story, lightened by breezy anachronisms and a throwaway comic-book ending. In the real world, Lovelace died of uterine cancer at 36, having published little beyond the 1842 article; Babbage lost the confidence of his financial backers and died embittered and unfulfilled, his elaborate engines still on the drawing board. In the cartoon, the duo 'lived on and built a giant calculating engine and used it to fight crime and have adventures' attired in superhero garb. There it would have ended \u2013 except that most readers took this as a curtain-raiser to a regular series. Their expectation was gradually fulfilled as Padua warmed to her subject, the flexibility of the web comic format allowing her to build increasingly ambitious stories in odd moments snatched from work commitments. The idea of Babbage triumphant in a steam-driven information society recalls William Gibson and Bruce Sterling\u2019s 1990 novel The Difference Engine, a key source for steampunk culture, but Padua did not encounter this alternative history until her own was well developed (Padua, 2009). Her treatment is much looser, and unapologetically silly (headline in newspaper account of the 1837 financial crash: 'Wall Street Trader Leaps From Top Floor, Breaks Ankle'). Lovelace and Babbage is not a graphic novel but a scattershot compendium of episodes, mostly redrawn and tidied up from the frantically improvised web originals. \u2018The Client\u2019, featuring Queen Victoria, broadly continues the prologue\u2019s off-kilter biography with ever-growing artistic licence; \u2018The Economic Model\u2019 is more obviously satirical, putting a steampunk veneer on a tale of banking woes drawn firmly from the present day (or perhaps not: the gags highlight the perennial short-sightedness of mathematical predictions, and the recirculation of crash and bailout across the decades). \u2018Mr Boole Comes to Tea\u2019 and \u2018Person from Porlock\u2019 are single-joke squibs based on, respectively, computational logic and the dream-composition of Coleridge\u2019s Kubla Khan. The longest piece, \u2018User Experience\u2019, centres on Mary Ann Evans, better known as the novelist George Eliot, who is unwillingly recruited to a steampunk text-mining venture: the book\u2019s one unambiguous pass of the Bechdel-Wallace test occurs as Evans and Lovelace meet in the bowels of the Engine to discuss cloud storage and cats.The artwork complements the absurd concepts beautifully. Facial expression is Padua\u2019s particular strong suit: her characters spend most of their time registering bewilderment or exasperation in a thousand subtly different ways, as well they might. Isambard Kingdom Brunel (who collaborated with Babbage on railway projects in reality) is rather conventionally portrayed as a burly, cigar-chomping shortarse in a giant stovepipe hat, but there is something irresistibly funny about his habit of leaning back and shooting the breeze as the results of his reckless engineering take hold. The largely superfluous central gimmick of having the action take place in an 'anti-informative Pocket Universe', sealed off from our own timestream and operating to its own logic, here permits the book\u2019s best insider joke (p 204): where the IT industry of our world follows Moore\u2019s Law of progressive miniaturisation, Pocket Universe computers are subject to Brunel\u2019s Law, becoming ever more unnecessarily gigantic until they blot out the sky. Academic reviewers addressing historical fiction often take it as their sacred responsibility to complain about the inaccuracies, preferably in almost unintelligible detail, in order that other critics can in turn moan about academics as petty obsessives. It\u2019s a disheartening task, and mercifully pointless here: Padua is well aware of her sins against history and chronicles them remorselessly in the text. Victoria is Queen around 1830, and the Duke of Wellington Prime Minister in 1837, simply because they\u2019re more fun as cartoons than their real-world-timeline equivalents. Elsewhere, the storyline not only drags in any and every nineteenth-century celebrity of significant public eminence or outstanding facial hair, but cheerfully raids the greatest hits of twentieth- and twenty-first century computing, with concepts from John Searle\u2019s Chinese Room argument in artificial intelligence theory to the extraordinary Newlyn-Phillips hydraulic computer popping up in ingenious period dress. Padua\u2019s work is, in fact, rather better researched than certain more solemn texts on Lovelace and Babbage. (This is not so surprising, as the best knockabout comedy is often underpinned by attention to serious detail: consider Les Dawson\u2019s genuine talent as a pianist, or the thoroughly plausible attack plan in Dr Strangelove.) With no formal historical training, Padua has gone rather deeply into the primary source base, aided by repositories such as Google Books and the novel possibilities of digital full-text searching (which also finds its steam-age equivalent in the narrative). Readers who know the literature will have an advantage in places, as when the two principals end up fighting for the Queen\u2019s attention, with all the dialogue drawn from their published work \u2013 Lovelace desperate to make a convincing case for funding the engine project, Babbage self-centred, tactless and self-defeating. It would be hard to improve on Padua\u2019s characterisation of Babbage as a 'blend of Mr Pickwick, Mr Toad, Don Quixote and Leonardo da Vinci', and only the most scrupulous and least jaded of historians would query her observation that his 1830 pamphlet Reflections on the Decline of Science in England might as well have been titled Dear Royal Society of Really Important People: You Are All Corrupt Idiots. Then there are the notes. Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell\u2019s From Hell (1999) started a trend for source documentation in graphic novels, with endnote sections outlining historical research and even challenging the main narrative. Padua goes further, littering the story pages themselves with footnotes. This is a bold decision: even at the sober end of the popular non-fiction market, many editors rank footnotes almost with mathematical equations in their power to scare off the casual bookstore browser.[1] As demonstrated by writers from Flann O\u2019Brien to Jasper Fforde, however, annotation can also be subverted for comic effect.[2] Padua\u2019s angle is to expand the notes to Brunellian extremes. Most pages carry one or more shortish notes from the perspective of our world, often citing sources for stranger-than-fiction quoted material. Some footnotes themselves have endnotes, much longer sections of (mostly) plain text which pop up between the graphic episodes, revealing something of Padua\u2019s own research journey. A few of these endnotes, in turn, have their own footnotes. In short, Padua has her cake and eats it whilst flinging it all over the tearoom, using the joke of her documentation obsession to license an obviously sincere project to share her fascination with the stories behind the stories.\nEventually, the detail does start to pall (recalling in places one of the few eminently peculiar Victorians not mentioned here, Edwin Edward Foot, a particularly unpoetic poet celebrated for knocking down any rhetorical effect or ambiguity with tediously literal notes of clarification) (Pile, 1979). The author delegates her self-awareness on this point to her characters, as Queen Victoria cries 'Enough!' and flings her sceptre into a particularly intricate exegesis of the abortive project to mould the Guelphic Order of Hanover into an honours system for the scientific elite. Tellingly, this text directed me to a useful recent article on the Guelphic honours which I hadn\u2019t seen, in exactly the way that academic research notes should (Hanham &amp; Hoskin, 2013).The cleverest and most touching episode is the last, \u2018Imaginary quantities\u2019, in which Lovelace suffers an atavistic reversion to poetry and trips through her looking-glass. Yes, Lewis Carroll pastiche is well-trodden territory (particularly for lovers of recreational mathematics: there\u2019s an acknowledged debt to Martin Gardner here), but the execution is pitch-perfect, particularly when Babbage charges in as the ageing, quixotic White Knight \u2013 an equation borrowed from Doris Langley Moore\u2019s first full-length biography of Lovelace. This story interestingly deals with the historiography of Lovelace\u2019s status and accomplishments. Popular narratives laud her as 'the first programmer' and, increasingly, as a crucial visionary (far more so than Babbage) of the computer\u2019s potential; opposing accounts dismiss her as a rich dilettante who merely summarised Babbage\u2019s efforts and could not even understand the established mathematics of her day. Padua has, of course, surveyed this debate, and despairs of it: an even more than usually nested irruption of footnotes charts impassioned researchers churning out monographs with titles like Ada Lovelace: A Fraud and a Lunatic, Lovelace: Vindicated from Biased Calumny, and What Do You Know, You Unhinged Partisan. Though reluctant to get involved, Padua does convincingly knock down one key claim from the anti-Lovelace lobby (pp 274\u201375) on the basis of original research. In fact, the Lovelace status battle, fought mainly by computing professionals, advocates and enthusiasts, profoundly misses the point so far as most professional historians of science and technology are concerned. The modern-day information society we know and sometimes love came about through the efforts and ideas of many women, men and institutions, often through interpretation more than origination. Though it is true that traditional tales of heroic male inventors radically distort reality, building up the occasional heroine in the same lone-genius mode does nothing to correct the problem; and the historian\u2019s job is not to award medals to the famous or the forgotten, but to explain the influence of the opportunities, barriers and identities involved.[3] Making a 'first computer programmer' out of Lovelace, or indeed Babbage or any Victorian, is, besides, a desperate contrivance: in any meaningful practical or professional sense, nobody had the identity of computer programmer until the 1940s, when there were finally some computers to program.[4] The most hardcore elaborations of the Lovelace myth, which make programming or software somehow a female domain on account of Lovelace\u2019s foundational influence, have ironically marginalized the existence of early women who worked on hardware (Haigh &amp; Priestley, 2015). Are such convolutions potentially funny, though? Probably not, but it would be interesting to know what Padua makes of them. Although she has contributed to the often strongly celebratory events marking the 200th anniversary of Lovelace\u2019s birth this year, it\u2019s striking that the book downplays the \u2018first programmer\u2019 claim and never demands that we see Lovelace, or indeed Babbage, as notably influential in our world. It does foreground Lovelace as an independent thinker and doer, which, in some senses, is certainly historically accurate. Making her the practical one of the pair, a no-nonsense pipe-smoker in overalls who\u2019s cooler in a cogwheel-related crisis than the perpetually flustered Babbage, is presumably a Pocket Universe adaptation of the real-world judgment that Lovelace\u2019s 1842 publication reveals her as a better communicator and interpreter of information technology concepts than Babbage himself \u2013 a far more defensible position than the \u2018first programmer\u2019 legend. The insane reliance on footnotes in Lovelace and Babbage, it quickly becomes clear (p 25), is partly there to remind us how social convention constrained Lovelace\u2019s opportunities, her only published work appearing semi-anonymously as 'Notes by the translator' of a male author\u2019s account.\nOf the original web comics, one, \u2018Organized crime\u2019, does not appear in the book, though parts of it are cannibalised for \u2018Imaginary quantities\u2019. This was probably a wise decision \u2013 the narrative is rather more baggy and sprawling than usual \u2013 but the lost tale is built around the promising premise of Babbage\u2019s once-notorious public campaign against street musicians, and features a delightful appearance from the electrician and cryptographer Charles Wheatstone as the villains\u2019 resident super-genius, inspired by the real-world Wheatstone\u2019s invention of the concertina. Would it be too much to hope for a sequel? A true graphic novel with a stirring central narrative would provide ample scope for the kind of ambitious ramble across the broad themes of calculation and creativity, society, status and State, into which Padua\u2019s infectiously digressive footnotes have already mutated the promised \u2018story of the first computer\u2019. \u00a0"},

I wanted to touch it, though of course I could not \u2013 but that did not stop me imagining how it would feel to stroke it, or how it would sound if I could tap the metal, or how heavy it would be if I could try to pick it up. I was, in other words, sensorially exploring the object, even though I had to intuit and imagine rather than directly experience most of the encounter. [\u2026] Nonetheless its three-dimensionality, tactility and sheer power had literally moved me to tears (Dudley, 2012, p 1).\nIs Dudley\u2019s reaction unusual? Absolutely not. I feel similar overwhelming emotions every time I visit the Mus\u00e9e Gustave Moreau in Paris. In fact, we all experience at one moment or another such powerful sensations at the sight of objects. What Dudley is attempting to convey and emphasise here is how significant the material qualities of objects are in producing these emotional reactions. The latter are not spawned by a descriptive label on a wall, but by the object itself \u2013 by the thingness of the thing. In the same edited volume Simon Knell calls this inherent state of objects the \u2018intangibility of things\u2019. He argues that any object, ipso facto a museum artefact, is actually composed of two things: the material and tangible (real) thing itself \u2013 not always reachable \u2013 and an intangible one, \u2018the product of experience and negotiation\u2026 [It] exists in our world but is made in our thoughts; it is ever present and inescapable\u2019. Though this immaterial creation \u2018appeals to the truth of the material object\u2019 it remains detached and fluid. \u2018The object in our thoughts may seem material, definite and fixed but it is in fact intangible, contingent and transient\u2019 (Knell, 2012, pp 326 and 328, emphasis original). In other words, what Dudley experienced so strongly in front of the Chinese artefact is completely dependent on her own personal being. Without the possibility of experiencing the real and tangible museum object with the help of more than one sense, in this case sight, there is no experiential common ground possible. Each visitor is left with her own and distinct contingent \u2018intangible object\u2019 based on her own idiosyncratic knowledge and familiarity with matter.\nIt is interesting to note that there is virtually nothing about the material culture of science in this edited volume. The properties of things are studied under the discipline umbrella of, to name a few, art history, anthropology, archaeology, management studies, history, religion, and of course museum studies. Why not science and technology? Is it not conceivable to feel overwhelmed with emotion when standing near one of Galileo\u2019s telescopes at the Museo Galileo in Florence or underneath the massive space shuttle Discovery at the Steven F Udvar-Hazy Center, companion facility of the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC? The answer to this question is obviously yes. But what happens if the object (scientific or not) encountered in a museum is unfamiliar and strange \u2013 the opposite of an iconic artefact? Will it produce the same intense emotion on visitors? What would occur, however, if one could fully interact with it? This was the position taken by the Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments at Harvard when it displayed a 1930s teleprinter in the Go ask A.L.I.C.E.: Turing tests, parlor games, &amp; chatterbots exhibition, produced in celebration of Alan Turing\u2019s centenary in 2012.\nIn Turing\u2019s test for machine thinking, we explained in the introductory panel near the entrance, a human interlocutor poses questions to a human and a machine. If the machine can fool the interlocutor into thinking that it is the human by answering the questions, it has passed as a thinking agent. This test assumes that intelligence does not hinge on any particular physical embodiment. Quite the opposite \u2013 the bodies of all human and machine participants following the parameters of the test, are hidden from one another. Turing proposes: \u2018In order that tones of voice may not help the interrogator the answers should be written, or better still, typewritten. The ideal arrangement is to have a teleprinter communicating between the two rooms\u2019 (Turing, 1950, p 433). Turing turned to the technology available in his time in an effort to efface the human body from the question of intelligence. The teleprinter becomes the medium for asking, \u2018Can machines think?\u2019[2]Visitors confronted with our teleprinter were asked to feel it with all their senses. They found that the keyboard was slightly different than the common QUERTY we are now accustomed to. The keys offered a strong resistance, not unlike old typewriters. The staccato produced by the type bars hitting the paper, especially when the machine received an answer, was alien to the ear. Likewise, with the humming sound generated by the motor and the electro-mechanical vibrations produced when the machine operated, all of which contrasted with the remarkable silence of modern-day portable computers. The faint bitter smell of ink and the radiating heat from the motor completed the sensory experience of the machine. Visitors discovered with pleasure that typing questions on this older artefact generated answers from the chatterbot A.L.I.C.E., which is freely available on the Internet.[3] Though we had to leave out the human factor due to technical issues, the old and the new were still united in a fully functioning machine. Visitors, through their sometime awkward conversation with A.L.I.C.E., were being acquainted with Turing\u2019s concept of communication and intelligence \u2013 and with this strange machine. The physical, hands-on interaction with the 1930s teleprinter made Turing Test\u2019s conceptual understanding easier to grasp. And since the visitors\u2019 dialogues were recorded on a roll of paper, their personal connection became a shared experience, not an individual, intangible, contingent or transient one (as discussed above).\nWhy does it matter? It matters because material culture studies have demonstrated repeatedly the importance of the shifting and fluid, even unstable use of objects in all socio-cultural, historical and scientific fields and time periods. Hide this lesson, shroud it in a learned narrative about emergence and transience and the actual object \u2013 particularly the museum artefact \u2013 loses its multiple meanings. Its function is destroyed. Caroline Walker Bynum, for instance, reminds us in a remarkable book that medieval \u2018Christian materiality\u2019 was all about the senses, the visceral need to be in the proximity of sacred objects to gain the direct and immediate ability of experiencing their powers:\nThe physicality we encounter in devotional objects (often in their combination of colors, depth of relief, textures, and materials) reflects and results from the fact that they are not so much naturalistic (that is mimetic) depictions as disclosures of the sacred through material substances. [\u2026] They ask to be touched, more than seen (Bynum, 2011, pp 38 and 41, my emphasis).\nHow does this translate into the context of a museum? Jan Geisbusch, writing in Dudley\u2019s edited volume, agrees that museums have done a lot to save a wide variety of sacred objects, but \u2018they have done so in their fashion, preserving their physical existence, yet bleaching them of energy and meaning\u2019 (Geisbusch, 2012, p 208, emphasis original). He concurs with Bynum on the power of touch vis-\u00e0-vis sacred objects, emphasising how much they are \u2018a matter of engagement, interest, desire, captivation, manipulation rather than dispassionate contemplation, study, or belief\u2019 (Geisbusch, 2012, p 207).[4] Such a dramatic (I dare say ontological) shift has relegated sacred objects exhibited in museums to the realm of universal and timeless aestheticism. Removed from their original religious context and disconnected from their primary functions they have become objects to be admired only for their beauty (Lipovetsky and Serroy, 2013).[5]\nAnthropological artefacts have suffered an identical treatment over the years. In Malaise dans les mus\u00e9es, first and foremost an attaque en r\u00e8gle against the Louvre Abou Dhabi project, Jean Clair criticises the over embellishment of the Mus\u00e9e du quai Branly, calling it a \u2018reductio ad aestheticam\u2019. The renowned French conservateur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du patrimoine condemns the museum\u2019s penchant for dismissing the objects\u2019 function to emphasise their form:\nLe dialogue que le Mus\u00e9e du quai Branly pr\u00e9tend mener suppose que les \u0153uvres qu\u2019il expose ne veulent \u2018rien\u2019 dire. Oubli\u00e9 leur contenu, mises entre parenth\u00e8ses leurs fonctions ou leur destination, ne demeurent que leurs formes. Cette mise entre parenth\u00e8ses des destinations, propre \u00e0 tous les mus\u00e9es d\u2019art, est particuli\u00e8rement choquante dans un mus\u00e9e qui rassemble des objets qui, hier encore, \u00e9taient, et \u00e9taient d\u2019abord, des objets de culte (Clair, 2007, p 110).\nClair is not the only one. The philosopher Bernard Deloche, in a small and sometimes vitriolic pamphlet, disapproves of the Mus\u00e9e du quai Branly\u2019s \u2018exotic aestheticism\u2019. He underscores the fact that such a practice devitalises the objects and transforms them into relics that Westerners can henceforth fully appropriate for themselves (Deloche, 2010, pp 46\u201347). The art historian emerita Svetlana Alpers calls this very act the \u2018museum effect\u2019. She argues that the museum effect is a way of seeing, or \u2018the tendency to isolate something from its world, to offer it up for attentive looking and thus to transform it into art like our own\u2019, i.e. Western art. She finds her own conclusion troubling because it means \u2018[i]t is to ourselves, then, that we are representing things in museums\u2019 (Alpers, 1991, pp 27 and 32). A good exhibition does not simply let visitors marvel at the beauty of objects, tuned in to their own idiosyncratic knowledge; it should provide instead the \u2018contexts and resources that enable audiences to choose to reorganize their knowledge\u2019 (Karp, 1991, pp 22\u201323).\nI have nothing against art, au contraire. Most early modern instruments now kept in science museums, such as Joseph Pope\u2019s Grand Orrery on display at Harvard, were purposefully designed to be attractive and decorative works of art. Science and art do inform one another, as physicist Robert Wilson demonstrated throughout his long career.[6]\nDavid Edwards (2008) even developed an epistemological concept based on the close relationship between art and science, which he calls \u2018artscience\u2019.[7] What we see happening nowadays, however, is an imbalanced tilt toward the arts, what Gilles Lipovetsky and Jean Serroy have called the \u2018aesthetization of the world\u2019. The authors contend that today\u2019s society of mass consumption has completely merged with art to form the hypermodern category of \u2018capitalisme-artiste\u2019. According to the latter category \u2018all is art, seen and valued as art\u2019. The hyperconsumer individual has lost all learned appreciation of the past and can nowadays assess objects purely on his or her own personal subjectivity and aesthetic taste (Lipovetsky and Serroy, 2013, p 396). The hyperconsumer homo \u00e6stheticus is also confronted with a modern style of architecture that shapes whole buildings into works of art. This \u2018visual shock\u2019 emphasises form over functionality. A telling example are the new art museums built in the last few decades: \u2018It is them we come to see, more than the collections they house, of which we often know nothing about\u2019 (Lipovetsky and Serroy, 2013, p 282).\nScience museums have taken that aesthetic turn as well, and the consequence is a critical loss of socio-historical context and epistemology. Take two recent examples among dozens. The Mus\u00e9e des Confluences in Lyon, recently opened, defines itself as a museum of science and society. On the architects\u2019 website the building\u2019s concept is described as \u2018The crystal cloud of knowledge\u2019. Crystal, for the transparency of its meaning and the openness to the visitors and the citizens of the region; cloud for the image of how knowledge of the future is stored.[8] Highly criticised in France for its cost (over 250 million euros) and look, this \u2018space-age\u2019, spaceship-looking museum is clearly after the drawing power of the building \u2013 the Frank-Gehry-Bilbao effect. (Or, for the pop-culture reference, the Field of Dreams-effect: If you build it, they will come.) Expected to get 500,000 visitors per year, the museum\u2019s collection appears at best secondary, no longer sufficient by itself to bring people in and epitomise the scientific ethos and practices. Some 5,800 miles away, the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco, at a price tag of 500 million dollars, has been completely rebuilt recently by a \u2018starchitect\u2019, Renzo Piano. According to the institution\u2019s Director of Exhibitions, \u2018The building is and of itself a large draw for many adults who are fans of architecture and design\u2019. The building itself, not the objects or the science, has become the arbiter of exhibit design: \u2018We try to think about the materials that we\u2019re using in our exhibits. [\u2026] [They have] to be of an aesthetic and design quality that\u2019s up to par with the building. I think a lot of adults pick up on it consciously or subconsciously\u2019 (Kehl, 2013, p 50). The medium is the message, literally. And that message shouts art history consideration over scientific epistemology and functionality.[9]\nThis is a recent trend. In Do museums still need objects? Steven Conn (2010) examines the changing role of objects in museums since the end of the nineteenth century. While artefacts were then at the centre of the museum\u2019s discourse and the focus of the visitor\u2019s visual landscape, today we can easily foresee a museum almost entirely devoid of objects \u2013 though equipped with a caf\u00e9, gift shop, high-end dining and an IMAX cinema. Conn also notices a direct correlation between the rise of museum educational programmes and the sharp decrease of exhibited artefacts over the last several decades. He justly notes that artefacts \u2018are no longer as central to the conception and function of the museum\u2019. And when they are made the focus of an exhibition the ones chosen for display, e.g. anthropological artefacts, \u2018are selected for aesthetic, rather than cultural or scientific reasons\u2019 (Conn, 2010, pp 58 and 35 respectively).[10] Scientific instruments suffer the very same treatment in science museums. Most of the time they are buffed until they shine (how dare we see dirt and grime!) before being carefully put inside modern, sparkling glass cases. Can we learn anything from these \u2018beautiful\u2019 objects? Not if they are fleetingly gazed at. As Baudrillard (2005, p 100, note 23) puts it, \u2018any object immediately becomes the foundation of a network of habits, the focus of a set of behavioural routines. Conversely, there is probably no habit that does not centre on an object. In everyday existence the two are inextricably bound up with each other.\u2019 If no means of access is provided to an object\u2019s specific \u2018set of behavioural routines\u2019, nothing can be learnt from this object. It has been converted \u2013 distorted \u2013 into a pure and functionless object.\nI will describe in the following section how habit, aesthetic considerations and epistemology were embedded in the instruments designed by Abb\u00e9 Jean-Antoine Nollet (1700\u20131770). The multiple functions attached to Nollet\u2019s instrumentarium provide a key analysis of Enlightenment socio-cultural context and natural philosophical practices, which are better understood in light of hands-on knowledge and \u2018networks of habit\u2019."},

In Newtonian physics, the conservation of energy is a universal law. Energy does not go up or down. It merely changes form: from performing work to generating heat, for example. The laws of thermodynamics teach us that energy cannot be created or lost but also that in the process of transformation some of it always disperses in waste heat or other less useful forms \u2013 entropy is always on the rise. Human culture, of course, operates within this natural setting and not outside it. But, in culture, by contrast, energy is of interest for its relative and evolving properties. Across time and space, the role of energy in human societies has varied enormously. It has done so with regard not only to the overall quantity measured in joules or BTUs (British Thermal Units) but also the quality of energy use and its particular functions and meanings. The same number of joules can appear precious to one group but barely register with another. Take heat: what feels cosy and comfortable to some, can appear as too hot or too cold to others. Anthropologists have observed striking differences between cultures in their energy use and sensitivities. Norwegians, for example, heat and light the whole house as a sign of welcome and comfort, whereas the Japanese direct their energy on a particular room.[2] While, of course, we would want to know how much energy is needed to heat a home to a certain temperature and how insulation and radiators might do so more efficiently \u2013 the job of physicists and engineers \u2013 we surely also should want to know how and why ideas of comfort were changing in ways that made people today demand more heating or more cooling than in previous generations. Similar questions arise in relation to visual cultures and aesthetics and our changing relationships to fire, light and smoke.We must therefore be careful and not treat energy culture as the product of nature. Energy cultures have a life of their own and generate dynamics that also exert pressure on nature, for example, by making societies want to generate more power to satisfy rising norms of thermal comfort. The moment we shift our attention to the demand for energy and ask what people do in their daily lives that creates this demand, how they think and feel about the energy they use become central topics of inquiry. In short, we need to complement thermodynamics with material culture.An important first step in getting to grips with energy today is to make it visible again. In part, this is an act of recovery. Before the triumph of large technical networks, it was a common trope to think of energy, nature and culture together. To take just one example, energy played a central role in historical materialism and in Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels\u2019 view of evolution. Engels appropriated Lewis Henry Morgan\u2019s study of ancient society (1877) to produce an evolutionary account of private property and social change. For Engels, the appropriation of energy from nature (and the technologies needed to extract it, both as food and heat) proceeded in tandem with the evolution of human consciousness and social organisation. Later anthropologists raised an obvious and damaging objection to this grand story: societies did not all follow the same line of material-cultural evolution, but showed surprising variations (Tilley et al, 2006). In many museums today, energy continues to perform a gradual disappearing act as the artefacts of human civilisation from pre-industrial times give way to industrial and post-industrial society. The fascinating National Museum of Iceland in Reykjavik illustrates the point. From the ninth century CE to the nineteenth century, energy occupies a central aspect in the galleries: as fuel it occupies a prime place in displays of hearth and home and the lives of the Icelandic population. Once the visitor moves to the section on consumerism since the 1960s, a radically different arrangement takes their place. Radios, fridges, record players, hair-dryers, television sets and many other consumer durables and appliances compete for attention. The energy needed to power these items, however, is now assumed. Displays of modern consumption take energy for granted in ways inconceivable in exhibits of the early modern home. In the corridor on contemporary culture, a single pylon stands lonely opposite the hall, but there is no invitation for the visitor to think about possible connections between consumer goods in an electrified home, new lifestyles and the new kinds of demand they create for the energy systems needed to feed them.Energy is likewise hidden in most academic studies of consumption and material culture. With its long-established focus on ostentatious or conspicuous consumption, luxury and affluence, most studies have ignored what sociologists have called \u2018ordinary consumption\u2019 and the demands it makes on power and networks. Resources and material are left to environmental studies, even though shortages and affluence have been twins of consumer society.[3] Even an excellent compendium such as the Handbook of Material Culture (2006), edited by the archaeologist and anthropologist Christopher Tilley and colleagues, only offers three page references to energy \u2013 and none at all to coal, gas or electricity (Tilley et al, 2006).\u00a0 Yet, when read closely, forms of energy come in and out of several entries, especially in discussions of the architecture, design and organisation of the home, such as the need for cooling in different types of buildings.The silencing and disappearance of energy can, partly, be pinned on the advance of gas, electricity and modern networks in the twentieth century and the story they told of ever greater ease, efficiency and comfort. The pioneers of electricity, in particular, promised clean, effortless energy and convenience that liberated the female grate-slave and her husband from the dirty shackles of the coal fire. The fuel itself would disappear, and with it the labour and dirt involved in operating it. Wiring would be hidden away. To access power, all that was needed now was the flick of a switch. There are some elements of truth in this story: the switch from an open fire to an electric heater banished the dirty fuel to a distant power station; wiring standards put loose cables behind plaster walls; once AC replaced DC and grids and networks took over, users no longer knew where their power came from; by the 1960s, meters moved from visible spaces inside the home to basements or external boxes.But, ultimately, this rosy technological story is also an idealised one that obscures a much messier process. In reality, power was never completely removed from the human touch and mind. Transitions from one fuel to another were rarely linear and involved people mixing and matching fuels and technologies. Tellingly, the Frankfurt kitchen of 1926, the very icon of modern living, included a stove that combined coal and electricity.\nIn addition to celebrating modern science, early gas and electricity adverts also borrowed from classical myths and romantic folklore. Prometheus and goblins brought light and fire.\nThe advance of gas and electricity was slow and uneven and, in Europe, took over three generations to reach rural communities and the urban poor. People needed convincing and new fuels had to be domesticated (Gooday, 2008). Coal was not only cheap. People\u2019s habits, visual sensations and bodily experiences of warmth were also attached to the open fire. In mid-twentieth century London, urban planners and local authorities found in their investigations that their constituents had a much lower demand for gas and electricity than the utility providers would have liked. On housing estates, some tenants were demanding more sockets and better wiring, but simultaneously many disliked new fuels and resisted the promise of \u2018better\u2019 technologies. In Britain, there were principled debates into the 1950s about whether it was morally right or even financially possible to deprive the working classes and the poor of their coal fire and to aspire to have the same shared norms of heating and lighting for all (Trentmann &amp; Carlsson-Hyslop, 2018). Nor should we overestimate the superiority of the new clean fuels. We tend to associate energy shortages with the poorer developing world. But the spectre of scarcity has haunted expanding consumer societies for centuries, from the wood crisis of the seventeenth century, across Britain\u2019s anxieties about a coal famine in the nineteenth century to the oil crises of the 1970s. In advanced industrial societies, black-outs and shortages were widespread experiences into the 1950s \u2013 and then returned with a vengeance with the first oil crisis in 1973 (Nye, 2010; Shin and Trentmann, in press). Not surprisingly, fears of running out of fuel made people look sceptically at big networks and turn to other fuels and systems of provision for back-up. Ideas and habits of self-reliance and architectural visions of self-sufficiency were the natural counterparts of such shortages.Putting material culture into the study of energy also means widening the traditional cast of characters and practices. The rise of modern networks tends to be visualised as a vast technical system of power stations, substations, transformers, peak operating schedules and grid operators. Such a point of view tends to be supply-oriented. When we instead turn our eye to what energy is used for, different actors are allowed onto the stage: housewives, children, the elderly, lighting designers and appliance salesmen and women, as well as office workers relying on energy-hungry equipment at their workplace. In the course of the twentieth century, official energy forecasts tended to legitimate a certain kind of statistical expertise and scientific expert \u2013 first scientists who estimated fuel reserves, then economists who measured GDP. However, many other types of expertise continued to circulate in home economics, energy exhibitions, film and literature peopled by experts and especially among women who knew a lot about the \u2018ordinary\u2019 use of fuel in everyday life (Wright and Trentmann, in press). Thinking about the material culture of energy should not mean turning our back on technological networks. These worlds \u2013 the large scale technical-system and the quotidian culture of energy use \u2013 do not so much co-exist as they are symbiotic. They are entwined through the social practices that are powered by energy: cooking, heating, washing and moving from one place to another. Demand and supply need each other and mutually determine each other. Looking at the dynamic flow between the two opens up new ways of representing and analysing our cultures of energy. They can take a reader or museum visitor from a domestic object, such as a refrigerator, and daily practices such as the preparation and use of a stove all the way to the distribution and generation of energy.\nThe essays that follow explore the rich, multi-layered dimensions of the material cultures of energy. For analytical purposes, it is helpful to distinguish between the main layers of the subject: materiality; material representations; materials in use; infrastructures and practices; and material politics."},

This is exemplified by the debate over the transfer of the Royal Photographic Society collection held at the SMG\u2019s\u00a0National Science and Media Museum to the V&amp;A (see Terwey, this issue), and the implications for photographs of a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) focus at the National Science and Media Museum. So it seems to useful moment to think about the terms under which photographs exist in museums collections. What are they doing there?Behind this is a much wider question: how institutions make objects one kind of thing or another, how location translates into category and the extent to which categories might be sustained or challenged over time. It is a museological commonplace now that institutions create certain ways of seeing that make, translate and consolidate objects as certain kinds of things \u2013 \u2018the museum effect\u2019 (see, for instance, Alpers, 1991; Kirshenblatt-Gimblett, 1998). As art historian Svetlana Alpers stated: \u2018everything in a museum is put under the pressure of a way of seeing\u2019. This establishes the parameters of interest and quality of attention given (Alpers, 1991, p 29). Institutions are, as Gillian Rose has put it \u2018groups of statements which structure the way a thing is thought\u2019 (Rose, 2001, p 136). Similarly Ludmilla Jordanova has noted \u2018disciplines have their own habits of mind\u2019 that do not necessarily translate (Jordanova, 2011, p 1468). Photographs, categorised as either aesthetic productions or informational \u2018bits of knowledge\u2019, can be seen as disciplinary roadways that \u2018facilitate the travelling of facts, but at the same time, like rails, they may also limit the range and possibilities for travel\u2019 (Morgan, 2011, p 31). Thus a collection/an object is placed within disciplinary landscapes that are constituted through a series of assumptions. These are expressed at macro-levels through the foci of institutions and their public \u2018branding\u2019. At a micro-level these assumptions frame the language of cataloguing and description, the ordering of information within records, the visual and textual languages of exhibition and so on. Thus, where and how photographs are encountered matters. Different institutions constitute different thought-landscapes which both enable or hamper research. This is particularly pertinent for photographs, which have largely been overlooked in debates of \u2018museum effect\u2019, because there is a massive confusion about what kinds of objects photographs are in museums: are they art or science, social or cultural, functional or aesthetic; how do these fields and purposes overlap? What is deemed worthy of collection and what is not? What is thus worthy of research and what is not? Even the kind of photographic object deemed important or collectable is dependent on categories, a point that will resonate through my account. Is the fine art print more important than its negative? And what of lantern slides, postcards, transparencies or stereocards? What about photographs created in the course of museums practices, which are of course themselves historically located? Different kinds of institutions, of course, have different sets of boundaries between \u2018collections\u2019 and what I have termed \u2018non-collections\u2019 (Edwards, 2016: see blog, Fotomuseum, Winterthur) \u2013 that is, material which might be of historical, informational, or indeed aesthetic significance, but none the less is outside the patterned boundaries of \u2018collecting\u2019. Non-collections, such as they are acknowledged at all, exist in a hierarchical relationship and are sequestrated to the margins of curatorial practice and kept, that is, located, as \u2018archives\u2019, assemblages of ranges of material \u2013 institutional histories, photographs or film for instance. These are seen, in many museums, as servicing \u2018real\u2019 collections, and understood as merely supporting, or providing information about, for instance, how ethnographic objects were worn, or the details of archaeological sites. They are not understood as historically important in their own right as photographs, as records and aesthetic statements about the thought-landscapes of the past. What is significant again is the way in which the relationship between location, category and assumed value is so clearly articulated.It is well established, as Michel Foucault has famously argued, that classification, here expressed as categories, is an epistemological apparatus that constitute political, social and moral discourses. Categories allow a thing, here a photograph, \u2018to pass over in its entirety into the discourse that receives it\u2019 (Foucault, 1974, p 135). Categories have ideological origins, and consequences become naturalised within institutional practices and agendas and resonate through them long after their apparent demise. Likewise language, in which collections are wrapped, expands or controls the ranges of possible experiences within institutions. Words of description, representation, and interpretation thus control the content of knowledge to be transmitted within museums at all levels, from researcher to casual visitor. As philosopher Jacques Derrida has argued, text communicates between absent authors and unknown audiences \u2018spewing out its manifold significations, connotations and implications\u2019 (quoted in Thompson, 2004, p 10). While the instability of the text remains and it is well-recognised that users bring their own agendas to the practices of viewing within museums, at the same time institutions shape and manage the kinds of knowledge which align with their thought-landscapes \u2013 what is \u2018collection\u2019, what is \u2018non-collection\u2019 is a statement about what is privileged and desirable. Such processes create central naturalised realities which mediate understandings, reproducing disciplinary landscapes in order to create a stability of meaning.These processes, therefore, come to carry an authority and credibility. An object, here a photograph, is made believable as one sort of thing or another through the whole range of museum practices. For instance, museum commonplaces such as registers or catalogues constitute symbolic forms as they track the rituals of the object\u2019s accession and disciplinary assimilation (Swinney, 2012). To what classes of knowledge is this object admitted, from which is it excluded? At stake in styles of communication within the apparently neutral tools of finding aids, access, and storage (including digital tools) are \u2018complex notions of cognition, memory and excavation\u2019 (Blouin and Rosenberg, 2011, p 4). In other words, these are processes which embed both historical and current institutional identities.To take a category, so obvious and so naturalised: the photographer. In almost all museum practices around photography the primary way in to the collections is by creator, the photographer. It is the privileged field \u2013 it is cited first \u2013 it meets the eye of the enquirer immediately. It takes its form from the library catalogue card with its concern about authorship, even in its digital manifestations. But more significantly, as a repeated pattern of information arrangement, it embeds within the structure of the museum the privileging of individual creativity and all that that implies. Gillian Rose, for instance, has demonstrated how the practices of description and cataloguing of Lady Hawarden\u2019s photographs at the V&amp;A construct her as \u2018an artist\u2019 (Rose, 2000). In this connection it is interesting that in recent years the Getty, possibly responding to the new interdisciplinary historiography of photography, has shifted from referring to anonymous jobbing daguerreotypists as artists, implying an aesthetic intention, to \u2018makers\u2019 suggesting a more generic sense of object production. Another example is the differing emphasis in the cataloguing of Bill Brandt photographs between the V&amp;A, which emphasise authorship, subordinated to content, and Historic England, which privileges unmediated content of the photographs.[1] Of course both approaches are entirely legitimate and explicable, but they furnish a useful example of differential focus at the intersection of process, format, style and content premised on location and attendant thought-landscapes. However, it is significant how this textual and visual privileging of individual creation has been normalised in the way a whole range of institutions, even those primarily interested in the content of the photograph, have absorbed this art historical model of the creator as the privileged shaping of significance around a photograph.Significantly, at Historic England the Bill Brandt \u2018object\u2019 is a negative, not the print which would render it an art object, as in the case of the V&amp;A photographs. The material form of photographic usage and survival has a clear relation to the practices of categorisation I am considering here and the ways in which they are shown, or not, in museums. The dominant form of photographic collecting as museum object has been the print. This relates to the discourses of modernist curatorship and the fine print, the final act of photographic production. Conversely negatives are not perceived as having aesthetic value in and of themselves. In the entrenched thought-landscapes of museums, they are merely instruments of the production of the desired print. Thus negatives, and like other \u2018functional\u2019 forms such as lantern slides, tend to be marginalised as archives, as supporting objects of higher hierarchical value rather than valued in their own right. For instance Damarice Amao (2015) has described the practical and conceptual challenges to the core assumptions of photographic collecting practices when the photographic work of surrealist artist Eli Lotar was acquired by the George Pompidou Centre not as prints but as unremarkable boxes of negatives; while Glenn Willumson (2004) argued that until recently stereocards were largely excluded from writing on \u2018the history of photography\u2019 because not only were they \u2018commercial\u2019 in production but their small, questionable print made them \u2018unexhibitable\u2019 in terms of gallery aesthetics. The point of these examples is the way in which categories of value and their implications are performed through everyday museum practices.Perhaps the root of the uncertainty identity of photographs in museums (see Edwards and Lein, 2014) is their ambiguity in the key areas of museum value hierarchy \u2013 uniqueness, preciousness, significance and material specificity. Photographs exist as multiple originals. With the exception of daguerreotypes, tintypes, polaroids and a few other single image techniques, the multiplicity is the nature of the medium. Consequently a range of museums, including the Science Museum, can hold historical and contemporaneous prints of a photograph by, for instance, W H Fox Talbot, Julia Margaret Cameron or Roger Fenton, stars of the art canon, and still legitimately claim to hold an \u2018original\u2019. But photographs spawn further originals, which also reside in museums, for instance, negatives, multiple prints, lantern slides, copy and mediated prints (details, crops, enlargements) and even the born-digital. All have legitimate claims to be \u2018original historical objects\u2019. Thus the very physical identity is ambiguous in museum terms as the \u2018originality\u2019 and \u2018significance\u2019 of \u2018a photograph\u2019 might be dispersed across many related but discrete objects. While photographs are not the only multiple originals to be collected by museums \u2013 coins and medals, prints and some industrially-produced objects spring to mind here \u2013 their multiplicity and its material performance is of a different order. The ubiquity of forms challenge the hierarchies of value and the categories that sustain them. What is a multiple original, what is a reproduction, and when does it become historically significant? All are assessments of hierarchy premised on location and category.Equally ambiguous, but marked by the division between the categories of \u2018collection\u2019 and \u2018non-collection\u2019, that I noted above, is that photographs and photography are the only class of museum object which is simultaneously a collectable item (a precious object) and a tool of management (used to record and present objects within the museum from conservation reports to websites), both of which are pertinent to museum practices and broader histories and constitute objects and processes that offer historical understanding, especially in the context of increasing interest in collecting histories (see Edwards and Morton, 2015). This is compounded by a slippage of language between \u2018photograph\u2019 (a thing) and photography (a process or activity). What exactly is being collected and under what rubrics? As Douglas Crimp notes, the \u2018fatal error\u2019 for museums, and especially those invested in photography, is to admit the very thing that constitutes it (Crimp, 1993, p 56) \u2013 because it devalues the intellectual, and indeed financial, investment in the assumed values that have rendered some photographs as \u2018important\u2019 and others not. As a result, the boundaries of photographic collectability tend to be heavily policed through institutional thought-landscapes, patterns of patronage and facilitation and indeed public expectation as to what photography \u2018is\u2019. As Bowker and Star have argued \u2018each standard and category valorises some point of view and silences another\u2019 (1999, p 5). As photographic knowledge builds up as an accumulated resource, it remains contained within clearly defined parameters and patterns and which values are permitted to be articulated (Foucault, 1995, pp 50\u201351, 128). As Tony Bennett and colleagues, following Latour, have recently put it, if museums are \u2018centres of calculation\u2019 which gather objects and assign meaning, the practices of ordering \u2018have implications for varied forms of action\u2019 and the ways in which values expressed through institutional practices are brought to bear upon diverse assemblages (2017, p 25). Thus has tended to perpetuate a dominant and dominating discourse that photographs are ascribed significance through a series of broadly aesthetic values and through individual creativity, values that are themselves grounded in deeply embedded, self-perpetuating assumptions. This is not a crude suppression or valorisation, but the imperceptible operation of normalised and naturalised thought-landscapes of institutional location.The extent to which disciplinary landscapes and languages shape research was brought home to me forcibly last year when I participated in an \u2018at the print\u2019 class for art history students at the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford, a major anthropology collection. We pulled from the collection Julia Margaret Cameron\u2019s famous portrait of Charles Darwin. Despite having done a Cameron class some weeks before the students seemed unable to recognise the photographer, and possibly not the sitter. Cameron\u2019s portrait of Darwin, embedded in the thought processes, language and storage regimes of anthropology was literally \u2018unrecognisable\u2019. Further, the print, which has a halo of chemical deterioration, was not the pristine object of the art history text book. Collection history and the category of subject over creator had marked it materially. It had been in the possession of a scientist and then in a general box labelled \u2018famous scientists\u2019 (PRM 1998.266), rather than treated to the curatorial practices of a precious art object. As a tension between location and category it perhaps demonstrated what Mary Douglas (1966) described as matter out of place \u2013 something in the wrong category, in the wrong hierarchical place, which thereby becomes simultaneously inexplicable and dangerous in that it has the potential to destabilise, even overturn, the values that sustain the thought-landscape.\nPerhaps photographs are more sensitive to where they are put than some other classes of museum object because they can be everywhere and nowhere: their meanings are so fluid, they can be made into many things, like the Darwin photograph. One consequence of this confusion of institutional meanings is that it is difficult to do the kind of joined up, interdisciplinary cross-institutional research that the new ethnographically inclined scholarship on the historiographies of photography have demanded over the last decade or so. These historiographies are expanding, complicating and challenging the linear trajectories of photography\u2019s historical narrative, especially the way it has been articulated in museums. An example is Mirjam Brusius\u2019 positioning of W H Fox Talbot as a polymath with a host of more pressing interests who happened to invent photography (Brusius, 2013). But such new interpretations are dependent on being able to cut across institutional thought-landscapes. New research is vital to challenge the boundaries of museums\u2019 limitations but is at the same time constrained by them. While no location is necessarily invalid, my argument is that the construction of a category is an epistemological and ethical choice which absorbs photographs into normalised discourses. Given that, as I\u2019ve suggested, many historically significant photographs sit outside the patterns of evaluation that I have described here, this position is worryingly systemic rather than open and acknowledged. My 2012 monograph, Camera as Historian, is a case in point. The book is on historical imagination and popular history, yet like many other books with photography in the title, it was placed in art history sections of libraries \u2013 sitting at TR57 in the Library of Congress system. Photography as opposed to history was privileged as the subject matter. The subtext is of course that if it engages with photographs it can\u2019t be real \u2018History\u2019 \u2013 but that is another paper (Edwards forthcoming). Books are set on this category trajectory by their default placing on the \u2018art lists\u2019 of publishers, regardless of whether or not they are anything to do with arts practice or use an art historical methodology. Such assumed categories are also at work in research peer review systems by which scholarly work is assessed for grant funding or publication. Projects that do not sit comfortably within these assumed categories too often founder on the rocks of peer review category problems. These systems, collectively, tend to privilege and reproduce the dominant but naturalised discourses that I have described. Yet despite the entrenched configurations of institutional thought-landscapes, categories are unstable and increasingly so in a digital age where practices of digital fragmentation and assemblage are \u2018beginning to undermine one of our most deeply ingrained ways of thinking\u2019 (Weinberger, 2007, p 22). At a practical level one sees this through exhibitions, where digital technologies and new display techniques are also beginning to admit other formats from the networks of multiple originals, for instance Tate Britain\u2019s 2014 exhibition The Poor Man\u2019s Picture Gallery.[2] The Science Museum\u2019s Dawn of Photography exhibition on W H Fox Talbot[3] included chemical experiments and botanical specimens that work within the central narrative of the exhibition, not merely as framing \u2018context\u2019 for a central artist. At the V&amp;A, The Camera Exposed included non-collection photographs from the Museum\u2019s archives, although interestingly the featured photographs on the website were all photographs traditionally categorised as art (V&amp;A, 2016, website). This is not merely a change in fashion in exhibitions, but reflects the shifting categories and hierarchies of values which are increasingly reshaping how photographs are thought about by museums. There are very few photographic exhibitions now, even those which take the \u2018traditional row of fine photographs\u2019 approach to display, which do not include the material performance or social and haptic relations of photographs (see Edwards, 2016, blog Fotomuseum Winterthur). Nevertheless, given the institutional, intellectual and financial investments at stake, the question is raised as to the degree to which there is a blurring of category edges. On the one hand, there are moves away from the confined and singular categories of photographs of the kind that had defined modernist models of curatorship. On the other hand, what is the extent to which such moves merely subject them to the dominant categories, while doing little to disturb the boundaries and the thought-landscapes? An increasing number of non-collection photographs are being presented under the rubrics of \u2018important early photographs\u2019. But often they are evaluated in terms of, for instance, antiquity, within a discourse of \u2018fine early photography\u2019 rather than for their formative role in the performance of a set of institutional values and their technical responses to it. In other words, is this merely a reinforcement of extant categories and a movement of photographs, which had for years been the basis for collecting between those categories or a wholesale re-evaluation of what those categories are actually doing? Resonating through this position is category of materiality, because the tension between object and image, information and preciousness, is central to photographic ambiguity in museums, as the embracing of early prints suggests. Thought-landscapes in institutions have increasingly embraced a sense of the material in the way photographs function. Initially this was perhaps part of a curatorial agenda to raise the status of photographs in the hierarchy of museum values, especially when funding bodies, keen on \u2018access\u2019, view digitisation as the cure-all panacea for photograph collections. Material arguments effectively became a necessary strategy, at a moment of danger, to position the mass of photographs in the conceptual categories and language of objects rather than merely images. This offered a conceptual base to preserve them against the assumption that they were nothing but the information of their content, and the attendant presumption, often by managers charged with turning institutional values into financial plans, that one could digitise the image content and the originals become irrelevant and thus disposable. As I have suggested, this was particularly the case for photographs which were categorised as information and archives, not as museum objects, and where, therefore, the dominant categories of \u2018precious\u2019, \u2018unique\u2019 and \u2018individual creativity\u2019 could offer no protection. The almost wholesale destruction of the photograph collections in the ethnography department of the National Museum of Scotland as late as the 1960s furnishes a salutary tale here (Knowles, 2014). The focus on materiality was not, however, merely a collapse into connoisseurial assessments of the fine print, but represented a growing concern within the new historiography to understand photographs as social objects, held in the hand, stuck in albums, projected in lecture rooms and so forth. There was an awareness that the meaning of photographs emerged as much from material and sensory dynamics which were themselves historical, and thus within the remit of museum preservation ethos, as it did from the pictorial. Not only was there an intellectual challenge from scholars and curators to reclassifying photographs from images to objects, or rather image-objects, but the challenge to find a language of description, arrangement and communication which was not the language of connoisseurship and the fine print, but was something premised on, perhaps, social usages, for instance the shift from \u2018artist\u2019 to \u2018maker\u2019 that I noted earlier (see for instance, Edwards and Hart, 2004; Batchen, 2004; Edwards and Morton, 2015). Above all there was a growing awareness, in this \u2018material turn\u2019, of archival fragility. The debate about the fundamental historical importance of the materiality of the analogue forms of photography was forged within a growing anxiety about the relationship between photographic analogue and digital collections, and indeed the very future of those analogue collections.[4] This brings me to the other major challenge to categories which is, of course, the digital environment and the challenges of unbounded assemblage to which I referred earlier. While I can only mark it here, I raise it nonetheless because it is at the heart of contemporary debates and tensions about categories. It raises questions about what happens to categories of information when, for instance, catalogues are translated from analogue to digital forms. For digitisation projects are never neutral, they are shaped institutional habitus manifest through institutional thought-landscapes and its categories. Ways of thinking about information even in a digital age emerge from thought processes that reach back centuries as \u2018historically framed qualities invade the current sense of facts\u2019 (Morgan, 2011, p 9). This process is integral to all I have described. For instance international standards and arrangements in metadata developed for museums tend, for photographs, to stress traditional and broadly art historical categories and hierarchies of maker, style or genre, rather than, for instance, cultural or historical ones which might inform, say, an anthropology museum. Object-orientated democracies of \u2018digital heritage\u2019 are part of a global flow in information and the infinite assemblage and reassemblage of images. Collections of photographs and their categorisations are increasingly managed to this end. Further, as rectangular flat objects, photographs are seen as \u2018easy\u2019 to digitise and lending themselves to digital dissemination. Targets can be met. In the process, photographs are too often reduced to content rather than being presented as dynamic objects, and layers of historical information obliterated as records are \u2018updated\u2019. Again, how does this shape research? While digital tools can undoubtedly offer opportunities of open-ended assemblage (or more negatively what Weinberger (2007) has called \u2018a disorder of the infinite\u2019) and a liberation from categories, museum applications too often simply replicate existing structures, and thus seem to be more backward looking than forward. Underpinning the debates about access there is perhaps that seductive, methodological lure that looking at more pictures, delivered through museum platforms, will somehow help us to understand better, that simply being able to see an image online suffices for research. Probably all of us working on photographs have received the dispiriting response, on asking for an archival appointment, \u2018Well, why? You can see it all online.\u2019 Certainly the dialect subtly changes despite continuing claims to objectivity. Changes of medium, changes in language (shifts in metadata) are processes of translation, re-contextualisation and re-figuration inflicting or imposing new meanings (Lager Vestberg, 2013). Possibly, but to accomplish that, the underlying categories have to be different rather than simply embedding dominant disciplinary and thus institutional thought-landscapes, even when the latter are delivered across multiple and expansive extra-museum locations. There are, of course, some admirable research-focused digital resources which privilege materiality, seriality and the networks of multiple originals in their presentation of photographs, for instance the travel albums of Isabella Stewart Gardner from the museum that bears her name or the Pitt Rivers Museum\u2018s Tibet Album project.[5] However, more broadly, an over-dependence on uncritical and assumed values of digital environments and their mediators threatens to have a detrimental effect on photographic research. Arguably digital environments, with their \u2018spectacular diffusion of information\u2019 and the impact on both means and ends of collection activity (Kallinkos, 2006, p 2), demand sharper critical understanding of, and engagement with, the nature of the thought-landscapes that generate them. They demand an excavation of the layers of historical disciplinary investments and the operation of their category assumptions, which are all too often invisible to both creators and users. The digital, which both enlivens and haunts photographs and museums, presents intellectual problems and epistemologies which demand new methods and new categories of relations between the qualitative and quantitative. Can this disorder be understood as the collapse of categories or does the invisibility of categories and their apparent digital re-/de-location simply become obscured? On current evidence one rather suspects the latter.My argument here is not particularly original. It obviously skims over a huge and complex field, and it has long been acknowledged that museums (locations) make objects. Much has been said on the power relations of museums and the implications of their classifications and categories, see for instance, Rose (2000; 2005), critics such as Sekula (1995) and Bal (1996), museum and archive writers such as Hamilton et al (2002), Schwartz (2007; 2011), Swinney (2012) and Brothman (1991), writers on institutions, information and technological change, for instance Kallinkos (2006) and one could cite many more. But it is necessary to revisit these ideas, first because with one or two notable exceptions \u2013 such as the work of Joan Schwartz (2011) or Nina Lager Vestberg (2013) or the useful summary by Tim Schlak (2008) \u2013 photographs have been largely absent from the debate. None of the positionings of photographs I have discussed is \u2018wrong\u2019 in and of itself. However, I have adopted a polemical position to bring to the surface the ways in which photographs have been so effectively absorbed into dominant historiographical categories that they are, in many of their institutional manifestations, invisible or visible only in certain ways. Second, a robust revisiting is necessary because, despite all the changes and progress of recent years, there is perhaps an apparently escalating fragility of photograph collections that lie beyond an increasingly and regressively dominating canon. One thinks here of the fate of the collections at Birmingham City Library where one of the finest and most eclectic photograph collections in the country has been effectively mothballed and specialist staff made redundant[6], the plan to charge for access to the archives (including photographs) of the Imperial War Museum (fortunately suspended)[7], or the narrow escape of non-collections photographs at Tate Britain. Here the photographs of art works and comparable pieces which formed the archival archaeology of British art collecting were going to be thrown out until rescued and taken in by the Yale Centre for British Art and Yale University.[8] With the majority of photographs, the power to maintain integrity within the face of institution thought-landscapes and their category assumptions is not strong. The result of this is that the way that institutions project themselves and their value systems onto objects and how objects are made to perform in certain ways has a profound influence on the way that they function as research objects and is part of this system of entrenchment of value systems around photographs. This position continues to constrain the kinds of things photographs become and the kinds of locations where photographic research can be undertaken. And this, for me, is worrying.Such a position changes the questions that are and can be asked, it changes objects, here photographic objects, from one kind of thing to another, shaping the kinds of histories that can be written at a given historical moment. It is necessary to attend to the shaping of hierarchies of institutional value, to the way photographic reproducibility cuts across how we think about value in museums, about what gets written about and therefore inserted into the discourse of photographic history and what does not, and ultimately how we are able to do research in and on photographic collections and the institutions that shape them. Even allowing for the re-codability of the object and the agency of the researcher, I would argue that those thought-landscapes are deeply embedded and naturalised within the assumptions of institutional structures and their investments, that the kinds of history of photography research that are done are legitimated through those institutions and structures of research, even in a digital age. What does that mean for the futures of photographic collections and research, caught as fragile objects between categories of institutional interpretation and significance?Anthropologist Daniel Miller has argued of material culture: \u2018The less we are aware of them [here institutional thought-landscapes], the more powerfully they can determine our expectations by setting the scene and ensuring normative behaviours, without being open to challenge. They determine what takes places to the extent that we are unconscious of their capacity to do so\u2019 (Miller, 2005, n.p.). In other words, arguably things and systems are at their most powerful when they are not noticed. The institutional thought-landscapes that produce photographs as one kind of thing or another are seldom noticed, yet they have a profound effect on the kinds of histories written, the kinds of research done at the very moment when new historiographies of photography are emerging. Epistemological, intellectual and physical locations matter too."},

He attended Maesydderwen Comprehensive School in nearby Ystradgynlais from 1977 to 1984, and proceeded to Jesus College, Oxford as an undergraduate. Initially trained in chemistry, he transferred his attentions to the history of science and moved to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge as a postgraduate student in 1988, becoming a Fellow in 1991. His studies were based at the Department of History and Philosophy of Science, where he received his PhD in 1993.\nJeff\u2019s thesis focused on what he called the \u2018radioactivists\u2019, the early radioactivity researchers whose ideas and experimental practices shaped the emergence of atomic physics as a discipline. He looked particularly at the community which formed around Ernest Rutherford, in Manchester and then Cambridge, and its relations with researchers in Vienna and elsewhere. Reflecting the analytical priorities of his own new-found research community, Jeff gave prominence to controversy around the replicability of the Rutherford group\u2019s experiments, the suppression of uncertainties over the validity of scintillation experiments during the search for alternative methods, and the practical role of selective narratives in securing community consensus.\nThis first major project defined an approach that was to be echoed in many of Jeff\u2019s later publications. His biographical interest in the mass spectrograph pioneer Francis Aston, for instance, inspired an examination of the role of Nobel Prizes in setting the scientific agenda, showing how the award of prizes to Aston and Frederick Soddy stabilised and promoted the validity of the isotope concept. Another article challenged nostalgic visions of a pre-1940s university physics based on benchtop-scale experiments and thrifty \u2018sealing wax and string\u2019 resourcefulness: in fact, Jeff concluded, progress relied significantly on industrial mass production for electrical valves and other essential parts, and connections with commercial suppliers such as Metropolitan-Vickers, seeded during Rutherford\u2019s time in Manchester, remained crucial following his move to Cambridge.\nJeff\u2019s own principal relocation, however, was the reverse of Rutherford\u2019s. In 1993 he left Cambridge for a lectureship at the University of Manchester\u2019s Centre for the History of Science, Technology and Medicine (CHSTM), established in 1986 under the direction of Professor John Pickstone. As the first long-term member of staff working primarily outside the history of medicine and the biosciences, Jeff was instrumental in shaping CHSTM\u2019s now-familiar profile as a genuinely integrated cross-disciplinary group with a strong critical mass in twentieth-century studies. This he achieved through international networking around his own research; through undergraduate teaching, focusing particularly on nuclear culture; and, above all, as a PhD supervisor and mentor. He was, at times, lead supervisor to as many as half the doctoral students in the Centre: several of these developed projects close to his own interests, but others pursued a much wider variety of topics, from crystallographic computation to airships to electricity consumption in the home.\nAnother priority that shaped Jeff\u2019s career was accessible communication. His best-known work, The Manhattan Project: Big Science and the Atom Bomb, appeared in 2002 as part of Icon Books\u2019 Revolutions in Science series, established as a forum for academic historians to produce affordable and readable accounts of \u2018scientific history as it really happened\u2019 for general audiences. Typically, Jeff\u2019s narrative blended a history of the atomic bomb project itself with a broader analysis of the \u2018big science\u2019 phenomenon, using the insights of his Rutherford-era research to argue that the Manhattan Project did not mark a fundamental watershed, but accelerated existing trends. The book was well received by its intended audience, but, thanks partly to its American release by Columbia University Press, has also found a niche as an undergraduate set text, accessible to science-focused students. Several researchers now working in the history of science or science studies have mentioned it as their first or favourite introduction to the field.\nThe majority of Jeff\u2019s original research, however, concerned British science, albeit often in the context of its international networks. His engagement with the \u2018radioactivists\u2019 continued throughout his career but was joined by a growing interest in the role of the Royal Society as a de facto national science academy and its relationship to government, chiefly in the years after 1945. Both themes addressed the interrelation of science, the State and warfare (whether hot or cold), but the latter allowed Jeff to pursue his fascination with the mechanics of officialdom and the power and perceptions of the British establishment. He was particularly delighted to discover a classic \u2018smoking gun\u2019 document in the archives, showing that traditionalist Fellows of the Royal Society opposed plans for a grand showpiece Science Centre to be constructed on London\u2019s South Bank because of the distance this would take them from their favoured haunt and strategic base, the Athenaeum Club.\nThe same fascination appears to memorable effect in Jeff\u2019s account of the 1955 Strath Report, in which the bureaucracy of civil contingencies planning collided uncomfortably with the prospect of a thermonuclear Armageddon. Other publications dealt with remarkable and unexpected stories uncovered in the course of Jeff\u2019s research: the production history of Ewan MacColl\u2019s extraordinary, absurdist 1946 agitprop stage drama Uranium 235; the recollections of William Kay, Rutherford\u2019s chief lab technician in Manchester; Francis Aston\u2019s familiarity with the \u2018occult chemistry\u2019 promoted by the theosophist Annie Besant; and the influence of J G Crowther and other politically engaged science journalists in shaping national policy. The last of these provided impetus for Jeff\u2019s long-term involvement in the emerging field of science communication studies, which in time became a major component of CHSTM\u2019s postgraduate teaching profile.\nJeff was a good friend to the Science Museum Group (SMG) over many years. He frequently arranged invitations for the museums\u2019 research-active staff to speak at CHSTM\u2019s seminar series, always laying on the warmest of hospitality and leaving speakers with a glow of friendship and a sense of being taken seriously. He also supervised a series of collaborative PhD projects alongside colleagues from both the Science Museum and the Science and Industry Museum, several of whom learned the ropes of supervision and advice from working with Jeff, besides providing informal advice to a number of other SMG students. His main supervisions, under the current and earlier collaborative programmes of the AHRC and ESRC, were as follows:\n\u2022\u00a0Imogen Clarke, 2012, \u2018Negotiating progress: promoting \"modern\" physics in Britain, 1900\u20131940\u2019\u2022\u00a0Emily Hankin, 2013, \u2018Buying modernity?: the consumer experience of domestic electricity in the era of the grid\u2019\u2022\u00a0Jakob Whitfield, 2013, \u2018Metropolitan Vickers, the gas turbine, and the State: a socio-technical history, 1935\u20131960\u2019\u2022\u00a0Rachel Boon, ongoing, \u2018The Post Office Research Station at Dollis Hill, 1933\u20131956\u2019\nA further connection came following the appointment of the current SMG director, Ian Blatchford, when the Group\u2019s Board of Trustees gained a Collections and Research Committee (CoRe), devoted to the governance and promotion of research and role of the collections within the museums. Jeff served on CoRe representing the history of science and technology, from January 2013, attending his last meeting in October 2017. In that role, as in so much of what he did, Jeff\u2019s insightful and congenial presence was a blessing. Ludmilla Jordanova, the trustee who initially chaired the committee, comments: \u201cJeff was such a lovely warm presence. He was always willing to help on CoRe, and I think he saw himself as a bridge between [the Science and Industry] Museum and his part of the University, since relations had not always been easy. I think, too, that he was a very good critical friend, who read the papers, and asked searching questions. I found him personally extremely supportive to me, and it was lovely to be around him.\u201d\nLikeable and approachable by nature, Jeff made many friends throughout the international community. He saw academia as an inalienably social activity: having been a mainstay of the departmental social life that clustered around the Eagle pub in Cambridge, he imported something of the same culture to Manchester, most notably through a monthly reading group, hosted in the convivial setting of the Ducie Arms, attended by staff, graduate students and international visitors. At conferences, he would sit up until all hours, reminiscing with old colleagues or planning the future with new ones: one such session is attested to have concluded with a trip to a Rusholme curry-house as the sun rose at around four in the morning.\nJeff\u2019s reputation as the life and soul of the party tended to conceal his equally valuable capacity as a skilled and efficient organiser (perhaps fittingly, given the close attention to the doings of \u2018invisible administrators\u2019 in his Royal Society research). His career-long involvement with the British Society for the History of Science included terms as Secretary and, from 2008 to 2010, as one of the youngest Presidents of recent times, campaigning on issues such as the preservation of contemporary scientific archives. His greatest administrative achievement was undoubtedly the 24th International Congress of History of Science, Technology and Medicine in 2013, which brought over 1,700 delegates to Manchester from around the world for a week of academic and social events, tours and excursions, and remains the largest event in the history of the field. The connections this established led to a new role as Treasurer to the historical division of the International Union of History and Philosophy of Science and Technology, in which he served for a short time before illness forced him to cut down the scale of his commitments.\nFor all that Jeff was a highly social academic, academic culture did not dominate his life: he was part of a close-knit family and a devoted member of live folk music communities in Manchester and beyond (a passion that was supplemented in his later years by an equal enthusiasm for jazz). Following his cancer diagnosis, and consequent early retirement, Jeff focused increasingly on spending time in the company of those closest to him, with frequent visits to the Northumberland coast, another passion. Yet he remained active in the research community to the last, finalising in September 2018 a chapter on the connections between Cambridge physics and the interwar radio ham enthusiast community which called back to his earliest work and developed its themes with reference to current scholarship.\nJeff is survived by his wife Natalie, Herbie the cavapoo, a large extended family, and three generations of appreciative colleagues, students and friends.\n\u00a0"},

If we look more carefully at their work we can also locate a special kind of sentiment, gravitas and profundity, as well as certain affective and emotional contents that might be accessed via the particular qualities of video technology. These artists share the special format of the gathered or created, edited and projected video image, a particular \u2018generation\u2019 (in both senses of the word) of moving image, accompanied by sound and now, thanks to easily accessible technologies, conveniently available for manipulation by artists in ways unknown to previous generations. Although video today might not yet be as popularly utilised and deployed in popular contexts as the more ubiquitous still, photographic image, we seem to encounter it\u00a0 as an increasingly accessible medium. Despite its hi-tech image and currency, video could be said to occupy a historical realm somewhere between the magic lantern, cinema, the slide projector, TV, and today\u2019s digitally animated images enjoying easy proliferation via social networks. What we now call \u2018video art\u2019, appeared initially in the late 1960s and early 1970s (Biesenbach et al, 2002) and became commonly used in the millennial generation of artists\u2019 works. It might appear relatively immaterial, delivered as a light projection on a monitor or screen and generated by the readily transportable form of a tape, disk or file; however, this apparent immateriality belies the various, relatively cumbersome devices and contexts that might be necessary to its production and display. In a landmark exhibition at Raven Row gallery, London, 2010, artist Hilary Lloyd raised her profile as an artist by noting a contemporary prevalence and tendency of video equipment to take on, in gallery spaces, a self-conscious, perhaps sculptural or even animistic presence.[1] Today, we encounter, in art galleries and museums, many elaborate references to video\u2019s various modes of installation and projection, some of which may come to compete with, and sometimes even overshadow, the work being projected. In her recent publication On Stage: The Theatrical Dimension of Video Image (2016) Mathilde Roman redraws the contemporary art gallery and museum environment as something significantly transfigured by the onset and proliferation of video art. Roman makes us newly aware of the unique ramifications of video art, in terms of its image, narrative, presence, apparatuses and the particular kinds of display contexts that have evolved to accommodate, enhance and serve video art and its audience. The paraphernalia required to present digital video might then loom large as its potential \u2018object\u2019 and yet may not be worthy of our \u2018love\u2019 (to persist with Geoghegan and Hess\u2019s terminology). Nevertheless, concentration on the apparatuses of, and elaborately contrived contexts made for video art may also disguise less obvious \u2018objects\u2019 pertaining to it, or typical of it, and with which we might develop some form of empathetic or affective relationship. In itself the video image might be relatively vulnerable and frail. When shown on a monitor or projected on a screen it remains subject to several contingencies of the environment, including the appropriateness of the qualities of the screen, the darkness of the room, the brightness of the projector, the quality of the lens, the efficiency of the media player, the quality and volume of the amplified sound heard through speakers or headphones which might, again, be of varying qualities. Then there is the correct or incorrect adjustment of the projector\u2019s or monitor\u2019s ratio and proportions to comply with the ratio and proportions of the original image, plus any competition that might occur between the projector\u2019s or monitor\u2019s light and other lights that might fall on the screen or distract the audience in other ways. However, where and when we find such vulnerabilities and contingencies we might also find clues and traces related to our theme of \u2018object love\u2019. It is after all here, in these material concerns, that we can begin to locate affective and empathetic principles whereby we might be \u2018touched\u2019 by a certain care, sensitivity and empathy for, if not the mechanics involved then at least for the vulnerable video art itself, and its implicit appeal to be adequately and accurately presented.The initial gathering of images for video art, whether newly recorded or gleaned from archives, is influenced and informed at the earliest stages of composition by consideration of their eventual redeployment in detailed layers and finely wrought sequences of \u2018clips\u2019 edited and projected on a screen, often in a dark, or darkened room. Today\u2019s video art, no matter how sophisticated it may be in terms of current technology or the currency of its content, is connected to an uninterrupted technological history that includes the histories of cinema, TV and photography, modern media that are themselves informed by literature, and painting. And so, if we pursue a genealogy of video art back far enough we could perhaps trace and connect it to art\u2019s assumed origins in cave paintings \u2013 more or less animated images, projected, suggested and in some way conjured by flickering light on walls in dark spaces. Video art is imbued with a particular sense of intimacy, as well as being evocative of a certain atmospheric \u2018gloom\u2019. Inheriting and extending some of the aesthetic and technical legacy of cinema, video art brings that legacy (also influenced by the more domestic realm of television) into play as the outcomes of video production (the intricate gleaning and weaving of almost immaterial sonic and visual minutiae) are projected in spaces that produce a special sense of privacy and proximity, often involving (as Roman discusses) relatively small audiences or individual encounters in carefully darkened, sonically prepared and otherwise strategically constructed spaces, often including appropriate seating. While \u2018object love\u2019 might not be the first concept we think of when encountering video art, I have nevertheless begun to draw out video art\u2019s particular and peculiar properties and propensities in such a way as to embody and transmit certain values of intimacy and affect. Having posited this as a common ground shared by the three video artists, I will now proceed by explicating their individual works and practices."},

But when Margaret Weston became Director of the Science Museum in 1973, she was the first woman to be given such a post. She was a pioneer \u2013 nearly half a century ago.Margaret Kate Weston \u2013 to give her her full name \u2013 was born in Oakridge, on the outskirts of Stroud, Gloucestershire, on 7 March 1926. Both her parents, Margaret (n\u00e9e Bright) and Charles, were head teachers and she attended Stroud High School, where she became Deputy Head Girl. In the summer of 1940, a German bomber crashed near the school, and Margaret, then aged 14, apparently detained one of the crew until her father, who was in the Home Guard, came and arrested him. Unusually for a woman at the time, she went on to study engineering at Birmingham Municipal Technical School (now Aston University), qualifying as a chartered engineer at the age of 28.\nWeston then became an apprentice at the General Electric Company in Witton, Birmingham, specialising in high-voltage insulation. In 1955, she left GEC to take up the post of Assistant Keeper in the Science Museum\u2019s Department of Electrical Engineering and Communications. Here she was charged with developing a new electrical engineering gallery, which opened in 1957. She spent the rest of her 31-year career at the Museum, which was until 1984 a \u2018departmental museum\u2019, a designation given to both the Science Museum and the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum since their creation after the Great Exhibition of 1851 and which meant that all staff were officially civil servants.Five years after her arrival, Weston was promoted to the post of Deputy to the Keeper of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Communications, Gerald Garrett. Five years later still, she became the first Keeper of a new department, Museum Services, which united non-curatorial functions in a single department.[1] She made such a success of this that the Director at the time, Sir David Follett, came to rely on her and made her totally responsible for the public face of the Museum. When Follett retired in 1973, she became his successor.One of the responsibilities Weston inherited from her predecessor was a plan to take over the rich historical collections of British Rail, stored at the time in Swindon, Clapham and York. In September 1975, two years after she became Director, the National Railway Museum in York was opened by the Duke of Edinburgh. It was the first national museum to be sited outside London and today, many years later, Dame Margaret is commemorated there by having her name on a miniature steam train, which visitors can ride on.The National Railway Museum was only the first of the new outstations opened during Weston\u2019s Directorship. The next was the National Museum of Photography, Film &amp; Television, as it was originally called. Two name changes later, it is now the National Science and Media Museum. As Keeper of Film &amp; Photography at the National Portrait Gallery throughout most of the 1970s, I had been campaigning for such a museum for several years. Weston was so supportive of the idea that she established a committee to progress it. I was the only member of that committee who was not on the Science Museum staff. The big step forward came in 1979, when the Museums Association \u2013 of which Weston was at the time President \u2013 held its annual conference in Bradford, Yorkshire. While being driven through the city centre on a double-decker bus, Weston saw the empty Prince\u2019s Theatre in front of the Wardley Tower, built in 1966. Over a civic dinner that evening, she asked the city\u2019s Chief Executive, Gordon Moore, whether he thought the building suitable for a national museum of photography (I am not sure if film and television \u2013 her brilliant additions to the original concept \u2013 were in her mind at that point). When he said \u2018yes\u2019, she asked what the city would contribute. Moore suggested a free building and a considerable sum of money: in the end it cost \u00a31.8 million to get the Museum up and running. If I can justly claim to have been the father of the National Museum of Photography, Film &amp; Television, Dame Margaret and Gordon Moore were its godparents. Without them, it would never have happened, and it would never have become\u00a0Britain\u2019s sixth most highly attended museum, the most popular outside London and 'the world\u2019s most popular institution devoted to photography\u2019 (New York Herald Tribune, 1989).When I was appointed to set up and run the Museum, I was given just seventeen months to get it open. Open it did \u2013 on 19 July 1983 \u2013 and a Times article marking the event said: \u2018The idea of the museum was only conceived in 1979, and the speed with which it has been made a reality is a remarkable tribute to Dame Margaret Weston, who was then President of the Museums Association\u2026and particularly to the museum\u2019s philosopher and keeper, Colin Ford, whose combination of doggedness and dynamism had previously been largely responsible for the effectiveness of the National Portrait Gallery\u2019s Film &amp; Photography Department.\u2019Staff at the Science Museum in South Kensington were less supportive of the Bradford development than they had been of York. A national photography museum, unlike a national railway one, had not been a long-term target, and no extra government funding had been made available for it. This meant that staffing levels in London had to be reduced and, given Dame Margaret\u2019s emphasis on education and public relations, this particularly hit curators. Another problem was the matter of storage. Blythe House, a late Victorian building in Olympia, had been built as the headquarters of the Post Office Savings Bank. After this use came to an end, the government bought it for \u00a36.5 million and offered it to the British, Science and Victoria &amp; Albert Museums as a storage venue. This building was so grand that it had featured as the setting for many television programmes and films (notably the hugely successful Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy). The Director of the V&amp;A, Sir Roy Strong, thought it too good to be just a store, and lobbied for it to be used for the public display of several of his museum\u2019s collections: \u2018Surely Blythe Road \u2013 which is a marvellous building \u2013 should be not just a dumping ground but an exciting new complex for the public.\u2019 But it did become a museum store, and stayed so until relatively recently; the Science Museum\u2019s reserve collections are now being sent 90 miles away from London, to the old Royal Air Force Base at Wroughton in Wiltshire where modern storage facilities are being built.\nDame Margaret had acquired the Wroughton site for the Museum in 1976, possibly at least partly motivated by the fact that, some years earlier, she had received a phone call out of the blue asking if the Science Museum would like to acquire Concorde 002, the supersonic British/French aeroplane which first flew in 1969. Her response was: \u2018Well, I want to preserve it, but I have no place to put it.\u2019 Typically, she added: \u2018But yes, I\u2019ll take it.\u2019 In 1976, Concorde 002 made its last flight \u2013 to the Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm Museum in Yeovilton.More successful was the acquisition on long-term loan of the huge collection on the history of medicine built up by Sir Henry Wellcome. Under Dame Margaret\u2019s direction, a series of galleries were built to house this, and opened in 1980/81. Forty years on, the Wellcome section of the Science Museum is still thriving, re-housed on the first floor of the main museum, and displaying 3,000 objects \u2013 the largest of its kind in the world.Dame Margaret\u2019s other long-lasting addition to the London Science Museum was Launch Pad, an interactive gallery for children which opened in 1986, the year of her retirement. It is still going very strong today, having moved around several locations, now re-named Wonderlab and continuing to expand. As her career progressed, Dame Margaret was beginning to be appointed to various public bodies. On 3 November 1975, she became a member of the Design Council and on 2 April 1977 of the Ancient Monuments Board.A major change in the management of the Science Museum and its outposts occurred in 1984 when they were devolved from direct Civil Service control to administration by a Board of Trustees. The phrase 'National Museum of Science and Industry\u2019, which had been the Science Museum\u2019s subtitle since the 1920s, was now used as a corporate title to describe the entire organisation. Weston\u2019s concerns about working in this different environment were soon left behind and she continued to put the interests of visitors higher and higher on the agenda.In the following year, Dame Margaret was elected an Honorary Doctor of Science at Leeds University and Honorary Graduate of the Open University. She also received honorary degrees from Aston, Bradford, Loughborough, Manchester, Salford and the Open universities.\nWhen Dame Margaret retired in 1986, the staff gave her a motorcycle as a farewell gift. Her retirement was of course covered in the press and on radio and television; two of the most memorable celebrations were the publication in The Times of a photograph of her driving a 1911 Rolls Royce in the 1981 London to Brighton Veteran Car Run and her interview on the BBC\u2019s \u2018Woman\u2019s Hour\u2019. After her retirement, Dame Margaret remained unstoppable. She became an Honorary Fellow of Newnham College, Cambridge, a Senior Fellow of the Royal College of Art, President of the Heritage Railway Association and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts. In later years, this busy retiree became a founding Trustee of the Brooklands Museum and a member of the Museums &amp; Galleries Commission. In 1989, she joined the Board of Management for the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851, which continues to encourage research and education in science and the arts. In 1990, she was appointed chair of the Horniman Public Museum and Public Park Trust, which may well not have survived without her Herculean efforts. Further appointments are listed in Who\u2019s Who[2], and research by this author and others suggests that even this list is incomplete. It is all certainly extremely impressive.When Dame Margaret died this January, the BBC marked her death and celebrated her remarkable career in a section of its regular Radio 4 programme \u2018Last Words\u2019. A major contributor was Heather Mayfield, who worked at the Science Museum from 1979 to 2014, for her last four years as Deputy Director. Central to what Heather had to say about someone who had obviously impressed her enormously was that Weston was always full of energy, and \u2018never took no for an answer\u2019. Heather and I agreed that, however diminutive and grey-haired Weston was, she somehow always had a commanding presence, and was an extraordinarily accomplished negotiator. Heather also told me that she had informed the presenter of \u2018Last Words\u2019 that Dame Margaret said that her favourite out-of-London development was the National Museum of Photography, Film &amp; Television. That statement was not included in the broadcast programme, but it was hugely gratifying for me to hear. Now, I only wish I had told her that she was the best boss I ever had \u2013 which she unequivocally was."},

Although the government and private entrepreneurs shared the recognition that the country needed to exploit its hydropower potential, business interests with an eye to regional monopolisation of supply dictated hydropower development. The private sector played the predominant role in extending electricity service to the population. In 1934, 816 out of about 1,000 electricity supply undertakings were private companies (K\u014dei Denki Fukugen Und\u014d-shi Hensh\u016b Iinkai, 1969). Outside of large cities, however, municipalities and local communities did act as important intermediaries in setting the level of electricity service due to their role in licensing utility companies, levying local taxes and enforcing safety regulations.\nThe electrification of rural communities was often mediated by local authorities through village meetings and town councils. For instance, when the town of Namegawa in Toyama was connected to the electricity supply in 1909, the town authority managed to keep the electricity price relatively low by negotiating the tariff with the local supplier Toyama Denki Company, based on the right to levy a tax on utility poles (Namegewa Shi, 1985) (see Figure 1). Elsewhere rural communities determined the supply company they wished to connect to and used collective bargaining to obtain advantageous tariffs. If they failed to reach an agreement with the supplier, local authorities could choose to establish their own supply by setting up a municipal supply company or forming an electricity utilisation association (Nishino, 2013). In 1937 there were 111 municipal and 240 communal suppliers providing power that was generally between ten and twenty per cent cheaper than private supply. These collective arrangements brought electricity to users even where there was little prospect of profit (Nishino, 2008).Pre-war Japan provides an interesting example of how utilities exerted control over material connections to households. Under many contractual arrangements domestic infrastructure and appliances, including home wiring and lamps, were deemed properties of the supply company. Customers were prohibited from modifying domestic wiring or using appliances other than those provided by their supplier. Most utilities provided electric bulbs to their customers, who were required to go to companies\u2019 service stations to get replacements when lamps burnt out. Some urban supply undertakings like the Toho Electric Power Company in Nagoya lifted such restrictions in the early 1920s in order to promote electric heating, but this was the exception rather than the rule. Other elements of supply contracts hindered the material diversification of electricity use. Domestic wiring in the majority of Japanese houses was initially designed to provide lighting only. The fixed-price contract, applying to around eighty per cent of electricity users (Kajima, 2013), assumed lighting would be the sole use of electricity and was based on the number of lamps and wall outlets and not the actual amount of electricity consumed. To use additional appliances one had to pay for the installation of extra wiring, a meter and appliance hire (Matsushita Denki Seisakusho, 1933). Japan\u2019s electricity grid added a further complication in distinguishing night-only lighting supply, used by most domestic users, from all-day supply that was mainly connected to factories and offices. A seemingly simple task, such as installing an electric heater, often meant upgrading the household supply connection and getting a new contract for all-day supply. As well as being a cumbersome process, customers who signed multiple contracts for different rates and services struggled to anticipate monthly utility bills. Electrification came to Canadian households slowly and more unevenly than in Japan due to a variety of different regional visions and public-private interests that influenced how material connections were made. Much initial activity to establish connections was to serve the interests of industrial customers but some utilities saw the appeal of serving domestic markets early on, either to balance load or to achieve social betterment (Klingender, 1994; Sandwell, 2015). Early patterns of grid extension reflected uneven population density and variable demand, generally only reaching areas where a minimum level of energy consumption or customers per mile of line could be guaranteed. In areas where people had access to central service, electricity power usage was generally low in the pre-war years, but there was striking regional variation. In 1931 the national average monthly consumption was 93 kilowatt hours (KWh) per household, but this ranged from 30 KWh in Prince Edward Island to 300 KWh in Manitoba (Sandwell, 2014). Given these complex provincial power contexts, we focus here on two regions \u2013 Ontario and British Columbia \u2013 to contrast connection policies. Both provinces relied heavily on hydropower but grids were extended under divergent political regimes \u2013 one founded on public power, the other dominated by private interests. Ontario\u2019s formative hydropower regime developed around a vision of public power as a means to overthrow private ownership and reduce dependence on foreign coal supplies (Nelles, 1974). Within such visions there was also a sense of the revolutionary potential of electricity in the home as part of a perceived need for diversified demand to support cheap power for all. Sir Adam Beck, chair of the HEPC of Ontario stated that his task in electrifying the province was to provide power for all citizens \u2013 the poor, the housewife, the farmer and the merchant. The beginnings of Ontario\u2019s provincial public power regime were laudable in terms of social ambition but relatively modest in terms of the actual expansion of grids, especially to rural users. Electrification was accomplished initially by connecting urban centres and communities near to generating stations with gradual rollout to other districts punctuated by economic depression, materials shortages and war. Preferential rates were offered to domestic consumers to facilitate expansion and to push out private utility interests, as in Toronto in 1911 where domestic lighting was offered at forty per cent less cost than by privately owned competitors (Klingender, 1994). Despite these efforts, in 1921 only half of Ontario homes had electric lighting and it was only in 1941 that electricity access was almost universal in urban homes, while only 37 per cent of rural homes had electric service at this time (Sandwell, 2015). Ontario\u2019s equalising narrative of cheap power for all was difficult to translate into homogenous connections on the ground, largely due to variable supply costs and the rural connection problem. The guiding principle of \u2018power at cost\u2019 meant that customers would pay only for the service they received, but in reality pricing policies were complex. In an attempt to provide some clarity, Beck explained in a 1923 address that electricity rates generally related to distance from source: Toronto, being ninety miles from the Niagara generating station, had residential service costs of 2.7 cents per KWh, while in Hamilton, fifty miles from Niagara, it was only 1.9 cents for residential service. In reality the equalising rhetoric of power at cost translated into the same rates throughout designated electric service zones, with charges apportioned in relation to economical distances from distribution centres in cities and towns. In the countryside the differentiation of technical connections and rates was defined in relation to rural power districts and specified classes of consumers. Information for customers in Ontario\u2019s rural power districts published in 1935 described the variable technical requirements for new connections for no less than 14 service classes of rural customers: including hamlet, farm and light-only (HEPC Ontario, 1935). Small hamlet service offered a two-wire service to residences with 20-amp fusing that limited appliances to a total of 1,320 watts, while the small farm service allowed for a three-wire service with a capacity for 35-amps enabling the use of lighting and power for a small motor or a range. Despite Ontario Hydro\u2019s equalising public service ethos, service connections and rates varied greatly for urban and rural users during the entire pre-war period and many customers struggled to understand the rationale behind this differentiation. Advocates for rural users, such as the United Farmers, criticised the utility\u2019s pricing policies, asking why some farmers paid as much as three times that of Toronto\u2019s power users and why some adjacent rural districts seemed to have widely divergent and seemingly arbitrary pricing policies (The Globe, 1926). Statistics relating to quality of electrical service for Canadian households paint a disparate picture between different types of users. Ontario\u2019s connected farm families tended to use less electricity on average than their urban counterparts in the pre-war period but many urban households continued to use electricity for lighting resisting the barrage of promotional literature about wider applications as a means to diversify demand and reduce rates. In Hamilton, for example, during 1921 the utility offered citizens the opportunity to install an electric stove and hot water heater plus necessary wiring for a maximum expenditure of $200 along with easy payment terms. Though many households responded to this offer, citizens also raised concerns about the ability of the hydro system to meet the extra load that thousands of new stoves would generate suggesting that people needed to be convinced of service reliability before they purchased appliances and re-wired homes (The Globe, 1921). Rural users also continued to have doubts about electricity\u2019s necessity given that existing appliances run on wood or coal were functional and versatile, as well as being relatively cheap and convenient compared to installing wiring and buying appliances. Unlike Ontario, early hydro development in British Columbia from the 1920s\u20131940s was characterised by the diverse priorities of private electric utilities. Two initial developmental \u2018pockets\u2019 of electrified space emerged in the first decade of the twentieth century due to the intersection of suitable waterpower sites and demand centres (Taylor, 1965). In the eastern parts of the province, servicing the Kootenay region, central station hydro serviced mining operations with residential demand a secondary service. In the south-western region, including the expanding urban centres of Vancouver and Victoria, the British Columbia Electric Railway Company (BCER) saw the future in the integration of the utility business with the synergistic development of transportation, light, heat and power operations. This integration of services under control of one organisation shaped extension policies. When the company extended electric railways it connected communities close to lines with lighting services, while places further away were deemed uneconomic to serve. Securing a connection did not always translate into quality of service or high usage for those living along radial extensions. Low voltages and intermittent service were common complaints that limited what people could do with electricity. In 1930, for example, a group of residents living in Saanich, 23 km from the city of Victoria, wrote to the utility to complain that they were dissatisfied with their lighting service due to the voltage being so low that lamps could not draw the required candlepower (B.C. Electric, 1930). As a consequence, lights were often out from 11.30pm to 6.40am, rendering then all but useless. Numerous complaint letters indicate that such problems persisted throughout the pre-war period and that for many BC residents their first encounters with electricity did not meet even basic expectations. The householders in Saanich and other connected places had to wait until much later for a dependable service. It was only in 1945 that the BCER promised the construction of a new interconnected and dependable power system that would enable those on the Saanich peninsula \u2018to buy all the service they wanted for a few pennies a day\u2019 (B.C. Electric, 1945). Another promotional poster from the same year featured a labouring Reddy Kilowatt dragging all manner of new household appliances with the caption \u2018They\u2019re on the Way\u2019.\nWhen Canadian and Japanese homes were first electrified, applications were rudimentary, being restricted to simple lighting arrangements often with a single overhead socket. As other devices were brought into use the configuration of material interfaces became increasingly more complex and to some extent dictated the pace of social change by limiting which appliances could be attached. Overcoming such obstacles was also of importance to electricity developers, as appliances were perceived as the key to expanding modern ways of life.\u00a0"},

His father was a surgeon in the service of the East India Company and later became Inspector-General for hospitals in Bengal. His uncles William and Hugh were officers in the Indian Army, and Uncle James was a Glasgow merchant. The latter was to play an early, but uncontented, role in Playfair\u2019s career.\nPlayfair was sent to Scotland, with his mother and elder brother George, in 1820 and raised in St Andrews in the household of his widowed aunt Janet Macdonald. His Memoirs brim with sentiment about his childhood (Reid, 1899). He reserves special affection for his Aunt \u2018Jessie\u2019 and her warm encouragement of curiosity and study. She was a keen naturalist and Playfair claims that she was credited with describing several new species of marine animals. His education was guided by two governesses, and then the parish school and local grammar.\nAt only 14 years of age (Reid, 1899, p 33), Playfair was enrolled as a bejant (first year student) at the University of St Andrews where he complained of the impenetrable \u2018slough of despond\u2019 in the mathematics lectures of Professor Duncan and endured his \u2018absolute ignorance\u2019 in Greek and similar imperfections in Latin.[5] Surprisingly, given his later career, he was not enrolled in Chemistry or Natural Philosophy although he recollected stealing into lectures, nonetheless. Playfair and his brother George delighted in driving the servants to distraction with experiments such as the extraction of sugar from beetroots (Reid, 1899, p 33). Such endeavours were to produce dividends for both men, with George later following the family path to India and becoming President of the Medical College at Agra.\nAt the age of 17, this juvenile period of Playfair\u2019s life ended when his mother returned to India with her daughters. George was sent to Edinburgh to study Medicine and the family decided that Lyon should try a career as a merchant, and so he was despatched to Glasgow as a clerk to his Uncle James (Reid, 1899, pp 34\u201336). His uncle was frequently in Canada and Lyon was bored for \u2018this idleness disgusted me with the mercantile life\u2019. Moreover, the household was one of \u2018arid Scotch orthodoxy\u2019 which he found \u2018repulsive rather than attractive\u2019. However, with hindsight he appreciated his uncle\u2019s probity and commitment to public welfare and he also enjoyed the friendship of his fellow clerk Ramsay, whose brother would become the distinguished geologist Sir Andrew Ramsay.[6] Andrew (only four years his senior) was later to become a close friend and indeed a recurring theme in Playfair\u2019s career was his great esteem for the eminent and emerging geologists of the day. \u00a0Playfair prized his copy (won at school) of Charles Lyell\u2019s pioneering Principles of Geology (1830\u201333) with its radical notion that the forces that had shaped the planet\u2019s surface were still in operation, a theory that had dangerous implications for biblical constructs of time. On making an annual trip to Arran with Andrew Ramsay, Playfair fell into conversation with Lyell and his wife while on the same steamer and so \u2018my hero-worship had its reward\u2019 (Reid, 1899, p 36)."},

Recent work has achieved a more balanced and nuanced approach to the episode than one animated by the opposition of good and bad, right and wrong, virtue and trickery. The exhibition at the National Maritime Museum offers a richer, historically more plausible and altogether more interesting story, supported in the same vein by the accompanying book (Dunn and Higgitt, 2014), while the programme of the related conference expanded the context for longitude work out to the broadest social, political and economic issues of the day[1].\nThis paper seeks to contribute to this trend by showing that some of the big questions raised by Harrison\u2019s work, concerning universal knowledge and its relationship to individual skill, were already at play in the community with which Harrison was obliged to engage in the mid-eighteenth century. The section of that community considered here, namely the astronomers, may seem the least concerned with this issue. It might be thought that astronomy had already achieved the kind of universality in the standing of its theories that had erased dependence on individual, embodied skill, and indeed that it was this characteristic that recommended an astronomical solution to the longitude problem. Horology and astronomy can seem to represent opposed, irreconcilable interests in the Harrison story, but similar concerns can be found around the question of embodied skill, even if Harrison did not appreciate this himself.\nIt might be helpful to explain that this is a study of eighteenth-century attitudes and ideas, some of which were at the time, as we shall see, applied specifically to Harrison.[2]\u00a0Aspects of recent research would identify his achievement as principally \u2018technological\u2019, a term whose meaning has shifted over time and must be used with care so as not to import modern assumptions. The present article has little to say to an ambition to identify the \u2018true\u2019 character of Harrison\u2019s accomplishment, though it may offer that project some help in explaining how Harrison was received and understood (or, it might be argued, \u2018misunderstood\u2019) in his time. Prominent among the notions that should be taken in the sense of the period are those surrounding the idea of \u2018genius\u2019.\nThe revisionist historiography of Harrison does not consider him a \u2018lone genius\u2019, as the title of Dava Sobel\u2019s bestseller presents him (Sobel, 1996), but he had a \u2018genius\u2019 in the eighteenth-century sense of the word, which the Oxford English Dictionary defines as \u2018Natural ability or capacity; quality of mind; attributes which suit a person for his or her peculiar work\u2019 (OED, 2014). We shall try to remain within that sense of the word, while bringing two other men of genius into the story: John Dollond and, more especially, James Short. Of the two, Dollond has the greater prominence, in both the popular and the scholarly context, while Short is already associated with Harrison\u2019s story. Both were telescope makers, but they represent quite different types of instrument, Dollond being famously linked to profound and far-reaching developments in the refractor (a telescope whose only optical components are lenses) and Short concerned exclusively with the reflector (where the main optical components are mirrors, though there will be lenses as well, at least in the eyepiece). For this reason we might have expected them to have been commercial rivals, but instead they seem to have been friends, collaborating, for example, over the application of the divided-object-glass micrometer to the Gregorian reflector."},
{"url": "http://journal.sciencemuseum.ac.uk/browse/issue-09/light-as-material/", "doi": "http://dx.doi.org/10.15180/180906", "author": "Joanne Entwistle,", "title": "Light as material/lighting as practice: urban lighting and energy", "issue": "Spring 2018, The Material Culture of Energy", "keywords": ["Light", "lighting", "public realm lighting"], "tags": ["Science and society", "Public engagement", "Twenty-first century", "Material culture", "Energy"], "text": "To flesh out our argument, we draw on a recent research project in Colombia, where we collaborated with Ove Arup\u2019s global lighting group on a pilot research and lighting installation project in Cartagena, Colombia called Smart Everyday Nighttime Design.[1] The concept was firstly that \u2018nighttime design\u2019 needs to be treated as a specific design discipline with its own problems and solutions. Secondly, the project was premised on looking for small scale design interventions rather than big and pervasive infrastructure \u2013 small designs that could be rolled out iteratively across a neighbourhood. Thirdly, the designs set out to promote community engagement, not only in consultation, but also in allowing people to customise and choose lighting variations and then to mount them at a human scale. (See Video 1 for a short film documentary of the project. See also Arup, 2015; Arup global research, 2016.)\nA photograph of Plaza Trinidad (see Figure 3), the main gathering space in our particular neighbourhood, Getseman\u00ed, illustrates all the properties of light discussed above; relational, fluid, indexical and emergent over time and through practices. The energy use literally pulses with the life of the inhabitants, recursively reflecting it and supporting it: the lit scene is an assemblage of a vast array of interacting lighting practices, including municipally-provided sodium lights on extremely tall masts; commercially provided restaurant lights and signage; moving car lights from both private cars and taxis; bright neon from food and drink stalls run on pirated electricity; shadows (prized above all by lovers, drinkers and criminals) provided by broken lights, blind-spots, physical barriers and dimmed church lights after mass; and we can add myriad little lights such as upper storey domestic windows and lots of little smartphones (including screens, flashes and torches). On the one hand, one can look at this picture as typical failed infrastructure in the Global South, a mess of cables and chaos, unregulated, un-designed and malfunctioning, with attendant waste of energy and other scarce resources. On the other hand, what all our interviews showed was both a love of the resulting atmosphere (a love shared by otherwise diverse and often conflicting social groups) and \u2013 at the same time \u2013 an ability to read the chaotic output of all this lighting as a coherent and interpretable pattern. As one interviewee said, sitting in that scene, behind the umbrella on the right: \"We all know where to put ourselves.\" Thus, rather than look at this scene as \u2018failed\u2019 and chaotic (and to be corrected technically), we can see instead an informational ecology: the lighting provides a wealth of information through which materials and practices can interact and mutually orient themselves. Put otherwise, the main Arup designer, Leni Schwendinger (then Arup\u2019s global urban lighting lead), when she arrived here simply said, maybe we shouldn\u2019t design anything, because \u201cwe could only screw this up\u201d. Her reaction acknowledges that any design intervention aimed at energy issues is an engagement with a complex information system that both emerges from and in turn supports complex ways of life; and it needs to be an engagement with that material-semiotic complexity rather than merely the technical (or aesthetic) portions of it.\nThere is no intrinsic reason why the chaotic lighting of Plaza Trinidad should be any more or less energy efficient than some of the high-tech and \u2018designed\u2019 lighting solutions that could be imposed as part of urban modernisation in the Global South (see Figure 4, depicting a standardised \u2018modern\u2019 mall just around the corner from Plaza Trinidad). What can be asserted confidently is, firstly, that any realistic assessment of energy efficiency in a lit scene needs to take account of all the practices that generate and demand lighting. The wider social \u2018chaos\u2019 will not and in fact should not go away. Secondly, that therefore an intelligent approach to lighting needs to look at the informational ecology of the social space, the way in which material properties of light and ongoing social practices can interact in ways that support a social life in energy efficient ways. To go back to the designer\u2019s response (and the eventually proposed lighting design, discussed below), this may require us to build on the existing forms of lighting provision, however chaotic, rather than relying on purely technical calculations of energy saving (standardised infrastructure models simply modified to use low-energy LEDs) and rather than moving to a purely \u2018aesthetic\u2019 understanding of the space unrelated to the social life that generates its atmosphere.\nThis logic of working with the indigenous informational ecology (rather than simply replacing it with a \u2018modernised\u2019 lighting infrastructure) informed the design and research project. We found that the \u2018chaotic\u2019 qualities of light were crucial to ways in which people used their spaces more generally. Above all, because light is relational, fluid, indexical and emergent, it does not respect common boundaries between public and private, municipal and domestic energy use: public and private lighting had to be treated as an integrated system, as a single and integral ecology. Approaches to energy consumption that divide into public and private costs miss the ways in which energy demand is assembled. To give an example: the original project brief for the Smart Everyday Nighttime Design programme was to produce lighting interventions for street-corners and doors. These assumptions (largely drawn from New York City where some of the designers came from) was that these are crucial and repeatable urban morphologies that are suitable for promoting an atmosphere of conviviality, gathering, welcome, hospitality and so on. The problem was that Getseman\u00ed, as we discovered after the first few hours of fieldwork, had neither street corners nor doors that played a significant role in the ways sociability was performed. Firstly, the neighbourhood barely had pavements, and the meeting points of streets were rarely meeting points for people. Rather, sociable gathering (outside of the main square) was spatially organised through the distribution of little pools of light around doorways, with people sitting on plastic chairs or the front steps of their houses (see Figure 5). Hence, doors were socially unimportant (and in any case they were mainly open if there was anyone home) while doorways, on the other hand, were utterly crucial to nightlife: the little pools of light for sociable gathering were mainly defined by light spilling through the grilles that covered the doorways, light coming from internal room lights and flickering televisions. The boundary between inside and outside was drawn differently from up north, with people sitting in their front rooms as if on the street, or sitting in groups on the street lit by their front rooms.\nCrucially, the lights and shadows thrown by interior lights were an integral part of the streetlighting and its atmosphere, as well as central to the informational system by which people spatially distributed their sociability and by which they navigated the streets and decided which streets were safe or welcoming (it is also worth noting that Cartagena, as Colombia in general, had only gradually been emerging from the decades-long \u2018Violencia\u2019, an ever-present memory of these streets as incipiently fatal). This meant that the relationship between public and private, civic and domestic energy use was not just complicated and interdependent: public and private lighting really had to be treated as one integrated system, as a single and integral ecology. People were clearly concerned about the distinction between public and private energy costs: when we asked people about who should provide lighting on their street, they answered that the council should be providing and paying of course, followed by typical and entirely justified complaints about the quality of municipal provision, as well as detailed narratives of provision failures like broken lights and power outages. Therefore, as some interviewees said, as they gathered in one of these pools of light, we contribute our own lighting and pay for it because otherwise we could not sit outside and people could not use this street. They then went on to a describe how their own domestic lights from their living room and the surrounding ones \u2013 civic masts, car headlights, shop signage and so on \u2013 worked together to construct the gathering scene that they enjoyed every night, and how the placement of themselves and their chairs related to the overall assemblage of lighting. Their own discourse clearly connects up material properties of light and its cost with the social patterns of life they were trying to sustain.The methodology for this programme was crucial. Firstly, the multidisciplinary team included a social research team comprising a sociologist (Don Slater) and an anthropologist (Laura Mendoza) who were supported for two 10\u201314 day stints of intensive fieldwork, in which we were able to interview and observe an extensive range of stakeholders, and map out the social practices of local spaces (particularly the Plaza Trinidad and surrounding residential streets) in considerable detail. Secondly, a team of spatial analysts based in architecture and urban planning were able to carry out a detailed spatial mapping. And, finally, the lighting designers on the team were able to both raise social and spatial issues, and to respond to research findings in their own terms. This team and programme was, unusually, sustained across two years allowing for extensive dialogue, and iteration, between social, spatial and design thinking. Based on this kind of fieldwork and dialogue, the Arup designers sought to avoid \u2018screwing it up\u2019 by working with the relationship between this indigenous assemblage of lighting provision, the sociable practices of diverse users and the night time atmosphere that was so valuable to diverse urban stakeholders. The design strategy that evolved from this research approach was to take up the well-loved lantern form, which is associated with a range of traditional street forms but also provides lighting that is human scaled, wall-mounted to relate to personal interactions, and producing pooled lighting rather than uniform coverage. Moreover, these lanterns could be customised by residents both in terms of colours and patterns and in terms of positioning. We piloted these lanterns through a public engagement event in one of Getseman\u00ed\u2019s streets, as shown in Figures 6 and 7, below. The installation looks very different from typical lighting master planning exercises and infrastructure demos mainly because it is so dark. But that darkness clearly doesn\u2019t arise from either technical energy saving calculations or place-making aimed at aesthetic moodiness (and, in fact, the pilot lanterns actually produced requisite brightness levels, meeting normal standards). It came out of the stories that people told us about the relationships between the material properties of light and the forms of gathering that they valued. And it was very popular.\n\u00a0"},

Founded to mark the sixtieth anniversary of Emperor Franz Joseph\u2019s reign, the Museum was originally established to showcase the achievements of Austrian technology, to be a great place of learning for the entire Austrian people, to advance technological progress and thus to be a lasting monument to Emperor Franz Joseph\u2019s reign (Exner, 1908). These aims are explicitly displayed on a marble plate within the Museum.In 1909, the Emperor himself laid the foundation stone to the Museum. Exhibitions had been planned by an expert committee, in line with the following principles: \u2018A more vivid presentation of the museum\u2019s objects is to help common man to better understand the design, operation and action of technical machinery and to internalise its nature.\u2019 Predominantly comprised of major industrialists, the committee also ensured that the exhibition became a showcase of the Habsburg Empire\u2019s industrial achievements.From its early days, the Museum was thus conceived as a museum of industry and craft. It also housed a postal and a railway museum with a separate director. Its exhibition halls originally comprised 29 departments, only two of which focused on the natural sciences (Principles of technology and Metrology) on a floor space of about 1,000m\u00b2 of a total of 16,000m\u00b2. The exhibitions were strictly organised according to ideas of progressive technological evolution.\nThe Museum was established at a time of mounting interest in popular-education initiatives even though the general public itself paid more attention to questions of class conflict and national self-assertion than intellectual self-improvement. The naturalist Alexander von Humboldt (1769\u20131859), a firm believer in the betterment of humankind through scientific insight, had been the founding father of a movement which was to lead to the establishment of the Urania in Berlin. He started with a series of sixteen public lectures called Kosmos-Vorlesungen at the Berlin Singakademie as early as 1827\u20131828. His ideas gave rise to the foundation of several societies dealing with popularisation of science such as the Humboldt academy in 1878 and (last but not least) the 1888 Gesellschaft Urania (Petrasch, 2007). The aim of Urania was to \u2018popularise the joy of scientific knowledge\u2019 by means of an observatory, experimentation rooms and a science theatre. The idea quickly spread across Europe, spawning similar institutions in its capital cities, including Vienna with a first provisional building in 1898 and the final one in 1910.Museums founded in around 1900 (such as the Deutsches Museum in Munich) often took up the Urania concept of popular science education and set up experimentation rooms. Technisches Museum Wien was no exception. Like all the Museum\u2019s exhibitions, the experimentation area was organised according to criteria following the structure of the various science disciplines \u2013 mechanics, optics, electricity, etc. But it also presented cutting-edge scientific discoveries, such as X-rays or gas discharge phenomena. There is a photograph of the Museum showing an experimentation table set up on the stage of the Main Auditorium.\nThis fitted in with the Museum\u2019s overall concept, which \u2013 modelled on the Deutsches Museum in Munich \u2013 placed special emphasis on live demonstrations and machines in operation. Such demonstrations were the only educational support made available, however. Visitors were expected to approach the objects on display with due awe, a fact also signalled by the majestic entrance porch with its columns reminiscent of a Greek temple."},

What is well known to art historians \u2013 that the materiality of the image and complexity of image making are constitutive of genre and aesthetic effect \u2013 has remained obscure to historians of science who are otherwise increasingly engaged with visual language and strategy (e.g. Baxandall, 1995). The mystery deepens if we consider the extent to which the discipline has elsewhere been concerned with \u2018opening up the black boxes\u2019 of mediating technologies, and with the practices of theory-making (Latour, 1987; Clarke and Fukimura, 1992; Roberts, Schaffer and Dear, 2007). More often than not, scientific and technical imagery is discussed as if its appearance on the page or the screen was a naturally occurring phenomenon rather than the work of the copper-plate engraver, the landscape painter or the computer programmer.\nThere are, of course, exceptions.[1]\u00a0One particularly influential attempt to grapple with the process of image-making is to be found in Lorraine Daston\u2019s and Peter Galison\u2019s treatment of \u2018mechanical objectivity\u2019, described first in a 1992 essay and again in Objectivity (Daston and Galison, 1992, 2007). In these works Daston and Galison describe how scientists working in the nineteenth century pursued \u2018truth-to-nature\u2019 by enlisting \u2018self-registering instruments, cameras, wax molds, and a host of other devices [\u2026] with the aim of freeing images from human interference\u2019 (Daston and Galison, 2007, p 121). Here we have a neat interweaving of the practices of theorising and image-making \u2013 precisely because the scientific practice in question was image making. No doubt, this is an important development in scientific representation: self-recording devices were certainly novel and elicited much comment. Yet the nineteenth-century also saw a flood of innovations within the much older technology of book printing, for example the development of chromolithography, steel engraving, and photo-mechanical illustration. Moreover, these techniques were often used in addition to the instruments of automatic engagement with nature, precisely in order to bring scientific illustration to a wider audience and cater to that audience\u2019s expectations. It is with the technologies and conventions of image production that the present essay is concerned.\nMy essay begins with a close analysis of meteorologist Luke Howard\u2019s cloud sketches, which date from the beginning of the nineteenth century and accompany his novel classificatory scheme \u2013 the cirrus, stratus and cumulus of modern weather-watching. In looking at Howard\u2019s clouds it is my purpose to show that, as this coolly scientific classification of untamed nature took hold, the imagery with which it was associated was increasingly bound by the conventions of Romanticism, and in particular the rugged ruralism of the picturesque. Lest this imaginative trend be thought limited to the first half of the nineteenth century, the remainder of my essay considers the impact of photography on the interpretation and depiction of scientific subjects. In particular, I look at the lunar photography of James Nasmyth, which exhibits neither straightforward \u2018truth-to-nature\u2019 nor strictly \u2018mechanical\u2019 objectivity. Indeed Nasmyth\u2019s photographs are typical of what I call \u2018manufactured objectivity\u2019, in which qualities later to be deemed subjective or contrived are praised for those very same reasons. Moreover, the persistence of convention and the praise of contrivance were not hindrances to objectivity \u2013 rather they were its guarantors, a fact that can only be revealed by looking at issues of genre and technique. My case-studies are drawn from the pictorial collections of the Science Museum \u2013 an institution whose own history is, I argue in conclusion, particularly tied up with issues of accuracy, depiction and generic convention. These are brought together in the consideration of 'atmosphere' \u2013 a term as important for the historian of meteorology as for the exhibition curator."},

It was created over a three-year period by a dedicated, interdisciplinary and international team of curators, designers, and museum staff, supported by a range of professional colleagues from the academy, biomedicine, fine art and more.[1]\u00a0In this short overview of considerations concerning the development of the exhibition and the impact that it had on visitors, I outline, as the exhibition\u2019s Creative Director, some of the significant intellectual and practical aspects of the exhibition\u2019s innovations. Split + Splice took place in the overlapping contexts of twentieth and twenty-first century medical humanities research, and the experimentation that is possible in university museum environments. Having set the scene, I will then look at the relationship between theories of personhood and flesh-and-blood museum visitors. Theatrical strategies of distanciation will be shown to be of considerable assistance in accommodating the visitor in medical museums, and we will see how down-to-earth Foucaultian concepts of power can be when they are applied both literally as well as figuratively to displays of medical technologies. In the second part of this paper, I go on to recount the ways in which the exhibition team productively meshed methodologies and skills through brainstorming and iteration, and how we moved beyond narrative as an organising principle for exhibition experiences.Increasingly over the past decade, rapprochements between higher education establishments, research centres, and heritage and collecting organisations have highlighted what is shared by all of them as \u2018knowledge institutions\u2019. This is leading to deeper engagements with material culture on the part of academics, more intellectually robust and exploratory exhibitions, and the emergence of new methodologies in both the humanities and in museum practice. Director Professor Thomas S\u00f6derqvist of the Medical Museion worked extensively with staff and colleagues to create a research-based institution which experiments and innovates:\nBy focusing on integration between research, collecting, education and dissemination beyond the museum world, the Medicinsk Museion will go beyond the traditional division between universities as pure research-and-teaching units, and museums which are primarily collection and dissemination institutions.[2]\nSplit + Splice was the first major such project at Museion. Its main funder was the Novo Nordisk Foundation, through the overarching research award Danish Biomedicine: 1955\u20132005: Integrating Medical Museology and the Historiography of Contemporary Biomedicine, for which Professor S\u00f6derqvist was the Principal Investigator.[3] The exhibition was the flagship of a sheaf of impressive \u2018outputs\u2019 associated with this pioneering research project.The exhibition itself was a multi-media yet low-tech project, which brought together a wide variety of materials, content, ideas, instruments, collections and disciplines in entirely new ways. It was not just about the science of biomedicine: it was about the cultures of biomedicine and the kinds of societies that its practices produce. It was about the inter-relations between biomedicine and the complexities of twenty-first-century living, addressing the long history of modernity that is present in biomedical technologies. Each of the concept-based displays meshing both historical and contemporary objects grew directly out of extensive curatorial field research into the history of recent biomedicine coupled with epistemological inquiry into both effects and affects of biomedical practice. With Split + Splice, we took the visitor beyond the \u2018user end\u2019 of biomedicine and into its engine room, bringing some of the big \u2018invisibles\u2019 of biomedical practice to a larger public in innovative ways (Fleming, 2007). Questions of samples and storage, data generation and management, the integration of analytical instruments with research and clinical bureaucracies, and the legal frameworks of biomedicine were all on our agenda.[4] These are critically important practices and yet they are also very complex to materialise and to visualise. They are not at all \u2018visceral\u2019 \u2013 they are unlike anything a visitor might have come to expect from a medical museum. And yet this exhibition experiment elicited deep reactions from its audience by engaging them in a conceptual inquiry about biomedicine today, taking people and biomedical technologies out of the hospital and bringing them together again entirely reconfigured inside an arena of thought.In the realm of museum display, the history of medicine arguably has an advantage over the histories of other sciences. This \u2018advantage\u2019 is also among the most difficult to deploy, the most volatile, and the most easily misused by exhibition makers. It is the advantage offered by the wide-ranging personal experiences of medicine that visitors bring to the museum, and the myriad ways in which those visitors\u2019 identities are a priori entwined and fused with their experience of their bodies and their bodies\u2019 health. No other science has content that is also held deep inside each and every museum visitor's conscious substance and psyche.Like a built-in counter-weight, this \u2018advantage\u2019 of the subject matter of medical history exhibitions ties the visitors\u2019 fascination with the exhibition to their sense of self. It is a tethering that, if mis-handled, can just as easily backfire \u2013 catapulting the visitor into a state of fear and abjection, and casting the exhibition (and its museum) into a no-go zone. Sensationalist misuse of instruments such as surgical saws, needles, laparoscopes, and specula \u2013 all of which enter the body \u2013 or of full-body MRI scanners, early X-Ray rooms, and covered stretchers \u2013 all of which enclose the body \u2013 are among the prime examples of medical exhibition shock tactics that can badly rebound.\nOne way to avoid this rebound is to look at the very relationship between medical subject matter and personal visitor experience as part of the exhibition itself; a philosophy lesson from the inside out, with help from the Brechtian distanciation effect (Pramaggiore and Wallis, 2005).[5] This is what we set out to achieve with Split + Splice. As historians and thinking museologists, many of the tools we have with which to attempt to effect this were first given to us by Foucault. Conversely it is not surprising that this great historian of modernity would first have looked to histories of medicine, psychiatry, the body and sexuality: this nexus contains so very much of all that it is important to reflect upon. And it is central to understanding not just biomedicine but also how people engage with cultural activities such as museum exhibitions.In an anthology of essays such as this, wishing to investigate and problematise the oft-simplified relationship between history of technology and history of science, we can have helpful recourse to one of the many amazing tools Foucault wrought for us. His theory of \u2018technologies of the self\u2019 was generated from within the particular frame of his research that could be described as history of medicine writ large. Technologies of the self engage variously with the other three technologies that Foucault also identified as part of four interlocking systems: technologies of production; technologies of sign systems; and technologies of power. Technologies of the self \u2018permit individuals to effect by their own means or with the help of others a certain number of operations on their own bodies and souls, thoughts, conduct, and way of being, so as to transform themselves in order to attain a certain state of happiness, purity, wisdom, perfection, or immortality\u2019 (Foucault, 1988). But this of course never happens in isolation. When these personal acts of self-realisation come in contact with what Foucault called technologies of power \u2013 which compel people to internalise attitudes and beliefs that are alien to them via subtle coercion and social pressures \u2013 those technologies of the self that originate with the intent to improve one\u2019s lot can become enmeshed in other acts and actions that can actually be compromising for the realisation of self. Yet these compromising \u2018governmental\u2019 acts that issue from the internalisation of beliefs alien to the self can at times present themselves as the only way to realise a self, often presenting themselves so invisibly as to appear even to be the best way to realise a self (Foucault, 1988).With biomedicine, many scientific and social changes and exchanges converge in the human body itself, and are therefore difficult for individuals to observe with any distance or objectivity. But what if we were to examine, in an exhibition, this \u2018contact\u2019 between the patient and the biomedical apparatus in all its complexity? Contact that is conceptual as much as physical; contact that takes place sometimes even at a distance, unwittingly, and at times without informed choice or consent. If we were to create an exhibition to unpick this diffuse and decentralised contact, bringing together people and instruments into an arena of thought, we would have before us the panoply of technologies identified by Foucault:\ntechnologies of production \u2013 instruments of analysis and computation; technologies of power \u2013 regimes of medical authority and knowledge; technologies of sign systems \u2013 medical vocabularies and indexical relations; technologies of the self \u2013 in which the individual attempts to care for the self, in part by engaging with all these other technologies.\nThis complex of technologies is, in essence, the scenario which the core exhibition team for Split + Splice attempted to both deconstruct and render visible \u2013 not for the viewer, but around, through and with her \u2013 addressing her as a thinking equal, not as a patient-in-waiting. Though we did not formulate the exhibition directly as a Foucauldian project, this description of our project is accurate, and speaks to the permeation of Foucault\u2019s thinking through much history, historiography and philosophy of science, as well as in radical museology and critical representational practices. Constructing an exhibition that deconstructed this patient/biomedical-apparatus \u2018contact\u2019 zone functioned to introduce an empowering distanciation at the core of the exhibition; it thus enabled us to deploy the powerful draw of medical subject matter in an exhibition without wilfully abjecting the visitor.Proposing implicitly that the visitor is among other things a delicate instrument and a deployer of \u2018technologies of the self\u2019 put the visitor at the heart of the exhibition whilst concurrently questioning the very meaning of the term \u2018technology\u2019 in a biotechnological age. The exhibition both acknowledged and highlighted visitor subjectivity by placing the visitor \u2018inside\u2019 an arrayed mechanics of biomedical practices, and yet resolutely positioned them outside of biomedical treatment. We wanted to address the social, political and cultural enormities of contemporary biomedicine without losing sight of the historical. As historians and epistemologists, we did not want to teach people the science, but rather to teach people how to think about science; to think about how bodies are contingent, flexible, fluid, resilient; how materials, tools and instruments have a history; how conditions for the production of medical knowledge change over time.This last is of most interest in the context of this anthology: engaging with an expanded field of conceptual and theoretical \u2018technologies\u2019 as well as physical technologies enabled us to transcend the reductive, causal, blandly narrative threads often constructed in museums between science as a practice and the material culture of technology. Of course, this is more easily said than done. It was important to us to get beyond \u2018stories\u2019 altogether, avoiding the built-in tendency of narrative to require both a neat ending and a display-case-bound object-anchor as illustrative evidence with which to tautologically legitimate itself. We then had to find ways to distinguish between different categories of object and of concept without inadvertently hierarchizing them. We set ourselves a tall order. In what follows, I will outline some of the process which produced this ground-breaking result: an experimental exhibition which won the 2010 Dibner Award for Excellence in Museum Exhibits of the Society for the History of Technology. I will show how our conceptual approach led us to define unusual criteria for exhibition-making. Along the way, I will identify some of our creative techniques, and address some of the object choices we made. Caveat lector: this short account can be neither comprehensive nor strictly developmentally chronological (Fleming, 2010; Fleming, 2013).[6] The process of creating this exhibition involved the pooling of knowledge and the transference of apparently disparate skills across a small, highly trained group; skills some of which in themselves had already taken decades to acquire. This \u2018skills exchange\u2019 involved history of medicine and epistemology of science practice, history of material culture, exhibition-making, collection management, design and more. In this crucible, we also forged new ways of working that will inform all our work into the future. The idea was to produce a double-edged tool which would help us create the exhibition, a tool in which epistemological and aesthetic enquiries would function in equal measure and in tandem: we wanted to deploy aesthetics as an analytical instrument as well as a communication tool, and we wanted to show that epistemological inquiry can guide what an exhibition ends up looking like. For example, an epistemological enquiry about standardisation in laboratory practice can uncover some of the reasons for the ubiquity of the appearance of plastics in recent biotechnology. In a complementary fashion, paying critical aesthetic attention to these plastics can contribute to the granularity of that epistemological research: colourways in the plastics relate to workflows in the lab; transparent high optical quality plastics are created for spectroscopic scanning with new analytical instruments. Because aesthetic judgements and choices are as significant in the production of objects and meaning as they are in their reception, aesthetics can be employed analytically. Further, in creating an exhibition, one uses aesthetic judgement in designing the display itself in order to bring to light the deeper-level functions, clues and meanings of the very objects one is displaying. \u00a0A series of team workshops or \u2018brainstorms\u2019 between myself as Visiting Associate Professor and the four post-doctoral researchers who were to co-curate the exhibition with me were held early on in order to identify the overarching issues and themes shared across their widely diverging fields of research.[7] None of them had ever created an exhibition before: as Creative Director, I gave a number of crash-course lectures in museum practice and exhibition-making which were essential to the production of the exhibition \u2013 such as Exhibition Making Process, Project Management for Exhibitions, Deriving Workplans from Concepts, Writing for Exhibitions, Artists Working in Science Museums, Working with a Designer, and so on. Further, in a two-day design workshop with UK-based exhibition designer Calum Storrie, we explored the spatialisation of thought, and ways in which the galleries of the Museion could be used conceptually rather than consecutively \u2013 working against the temptation to express concepts and ideas through storytelling.By mid-2008 we had created a framework (including an Exhibition Brief, a list of agreed Limit Parameters or creative constraints, and other process-oriented guidelines) with which to begin the conceptual materialisation of the exhibition itself, and to choose exhibition objects from both Museion\u2019s collections and further afield.Our Exhibition Brief stated concisely that: \u2018The core aim of the exhibition is to facilitate visitors\u2019 informed reflections upon the ways in which recent biomedicine challenges significant cultural categories including the body and identity, therefore influencing our very understanding of ourselves as human beings, our sense of \u201cpersonhood\u201d. The exhibition will explore how both identities and bodies \u2013 two sides of the same \u201cpersonhood\u201d coin \u2013 are produced, constituted, re-engineered, collected, circulated, fragmented, hybridized, mediated, suspended, digitized, controlled and categorized by current biomedical practices.\u2019[8]The parameters and creative constraints we gave ourselves within which to work were refined over the conceptualisation period, and yet remained very close to some of those we first set out with, such as:\nEvery object and image must relate to more than one issue, so there will be no one-to-one equivalences between idea and image: everything needs to do the work of problematising several issues and practices at once. Everything we do must help to destabilise the truth-value of representation, particularly forms of realism, so that people can by extension have a way to question both scientific objectivity and transparency as a metaphor for intellectual and social clarity. [We will] introduce both historical and representational critique and reflexivity into everything we do.[9]\nOne example of the meshing of representational and historical reflexivity and critique in Split + Splice can be seen in Section 4 of the exhibition, entitled Reality Show. Instruments and accoutrements from five different historically-bound techniques for representing the human foetus were explored: Drawing and Engraving; Preservation of Specimens; Wax Models; Histology; and Ultrasound. These five cases were set in front of a two-way mirror which visitors could step behind. On the other side, they found in isolation the realistic images which these complex techniques were capable of producing \u2013 a technical complexity often subsumed in realism, a genre which borrows the appearance of life, creating images easily press-ganged into serving as truth claims.\nIt is worth noting that with the Museion Vision for an integrated collection and research institution, Director S\u00f6derqvist had charged the post-doctoral researchers with collecting the material culture of contemporary biomedicine as part of their field research process. These new collections were a starting point for the development of the exhibition \u2013 both the objects and the problems they presented. The huge \u2018invisibles\u2019 of contemporary biomedicine and its complex practices would be difficult to represent with the mainly standardised disposable plastic materials of contemporary biomedicine which had rightly been amassed by the post-docs. Many of these objects were both anodyne and existentially complex: how to make the latter shine through the former? Because material gathered for collection purposes is very different from material needed for an exhibition \u2013 which requires contextual, correlative and other objects to create counterpoint in order to inspire both understanding and excitement. From our Exhibition Brief again:\nThe exhibition medium is an environment: this environment needs to embody the contexts of contemporary biomedicine, not just \u2018explain\u2019 these contexts didactically. Visitors may encounter refrigeration units and biosecure areas, [...] incubation units for animals and unusual electronic and mechanical instruments. \u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0the audience\u2019s own bodies will be used as \u2018instruments\u2019 by which those same individuals can \u2018measure\u2019 realities of contemporary biomedicine phenomenologically;\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0the in-house collections at Medical Museion will be used in analogical, material and metaphorical ways as well as historical ways;\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0the exhibition will use medical instruments (research and clinical) in non-medical ways that open them to critique and playful exploration by the visitors; \u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0simple mechanical instruments from medicine and everyday life which are well understood will be used as a springboard to explore electronic and digital aspects of biomedicine: a spinning salad dryer can help in understanding a centrifuge.[10]\nWith these ideas among others to the forefront, we began to look closely at the Museion collection, the materials that the post-docs had collected, and other objects \u2013 including some that were very large indeed \u2013 which were further afield and embedded in life sciences research labs, hospitals, and clinical environments. With the extended community \u2013 and inestimable help \u2013 of the University of Copenhagen\u2019s Faculty of Health and the contacts the post-docs had made during their field research, we were also able to call on a much wider base for exhibition objects. We moved from ideas to objects and back again quickly and often, during a process of rolling brainstorms which often involved the objects themselves. \u00a0In all, and including the design phase, there were some 45 brainstorms, workshops and other concept meetings and seminars which formed the developmental arc of the exhibition. It was during these sessions that we were able to dovetail aesthetics and epistemologies of biomedicine via object and design choices. The structure of the brainstorms themselves was fairly standard: identification of issues to be explored, preparation and pre-circulation of a framework for the discussion, an exploratory and open meeting of finite length which is whiteboarded by the discussion leader, post-meeting analysis and capture of the outcomes which is circulated, and finally the incorporation of those outcomes as part of the givens for future brainstorms. For example, having held several brainstorms about medical visualisation and about data management and modelling in medicine, we then held a brainstorm about overlaps and connections between these two intertwined fields. A key point of the success of these discussions was that we were in fact not only interested in each others\u2019 work, and very different from each other in terms of our knowledge bases and fields of practice, but we were also dependent upon each other for pieces of the puzzle. Without taking on trust each others\u2019 work and opinions, we would not have been able to move forward to create an exhibition. So the oft-heard brainstorm technique rule of suspending judgement also meant, in this case, maintaining faith in each other\u2019s judgement. In spite of the scheduling pressures we experienced, the time we spent on conceptual work towards the exhibition was not only essential, but an exciting arena of sharing knowledge and finding sound conceptual links between fields of study, representational and aesthetic structures, epistemological analyses, collection objects, urban and exhibition spaces, and visitor experience from a phenomenological point of view. We had to move quickly, be concise and rigorous, and remain open \u2013 and as relaxed as possible. This last was of course the most difficult.To develop skills of \u2018thinking through objects\u2019 in the historians of the group, we held a number of seminars to examine in depth the materiality of the Museion collections, some with the precious contribution of Collection Manager and Conservation Director Ion Meyer. Other such seminars were those in which collection instruments were used to \u2018play with\u2019 \u2013 both as interactives and as metaphors. Jan-Eric Ols\u00e9n, whose work focuses on medical visualisation, gave an instrument-rich seminar tracing the continued presence of the precepts of Renaissance optics inside the high-tech imaging of contemporary biomedicine.As a co-relative to the history of optics in medicine, we turned towards biomedicine's observation techniques and technologies, examining the centrality to both museums and biomedical practice of the importance of display; a key crossover that we had identified as both epistemologically significant and highly useful to us in an exhibition context.[11] The fine line between attentive care and medical surveillance was explored in relation to the formation of the body politic through, among others, public health policy and data collection: once again there were synergies with museum practice \u2013 collections held in trust for the nation and surveillance cameras as a form of \u2018security\u2019.A number of research outings were also significant. We went to the Copenhagen City Museum with a view to critiquing object choices, exhibition design, display texts and more. We were particularly impressed by the exhibition Storbystr\u00f8mme, concerning underground waterways and electricity cabling, which was designed by Mikael Thorsted. This honed the capacity of the historians to articulate what works in museum displays and why. Susanne Bauer followed up a contact at the Danish Data Historical Association which led to an Aladdin\u2019s Cave of computing history: the Association became a major lender to the Data Avalanche section of the exhibition. S\u00f8ren Bak-Jensen crucially arranged for us to visit the Cold Rooms and refrigeration team of the University\u2019s Panum Institute, as well as to take a behind-the-scenes tour of the High Court building immediately opposite the Medical Museion. This very, very large \u2018object\u2019 \u2013 visible from a number of the galleries of the Museion in which Split + Splice was to take place \u2013 is also the site of the arbitration of legislation in relation to biomedicine. This took to a new level an awareness of the position \u2013 both literally and figuratively \u2013 of the Museion building, which had been the College of Physicians and Surgeons (founded 1792). Architecture in the dense power-centre of the city is an intersecting set of signs \u2013 each \u2018technology\u2019 visible as an edifice to the other through overlooking windows.\nIndeed, we even workshopped subjects which we did not foreground in the exhibition. One workshop in particular, entitled \u2018Hope and Health: The User End, Biomedical Benefits\u2019 was particularly helpful in that the discussions made clear the fact that this kind of \u2018patient-focused\u2019, emotionally charged content would be exactly the sort of material that would appear to meet visitor expectation of our exhibition, whilst in actual fact eliciting visitor anxiety and inexorably drawing the project towards presenting a view of biomedicine reduced to a narrow interpretation of progressivist \u2018public service\u2019. Which is not to say that biomedicine does not produce huge advances in human health, only that this was not the subject of the exhibition we were making.\u00a0The Museion collection itself, which we wanted to engage as a set of historical anchors for the exhibition, is as impressive and as frustrating as any university museum collection can be. Universities the world over have an urgent responsibility to release the huge interdisciplinary research potential locked up in their museums, and which is currently often caught between underfunding of collection management and overuse by the untrained.[12] In spite of the highly skilled and dedicated Museion staff, working far beyond the call of duty, the exhibition team had difficulties in locating materials we were interested in, both through the range of different catalogues and in visits to store-rooms scattered about the University of Copenhagen. But serendipity can be an important research tool \u2013 even in the best-endowed of museums. In certain cases, unique elements of the Museion\u2019s exciting collections were a focus for particular brainstorms: an important donation from the DAKO company (a diagnostics manufacturer of antibodies, reagents and instruments) includes the original materials used by founder Dr Niels Harboe when he was the first Director of the Protein Laboratory of the University of Copenhagen in the 1970s. Among these objects are the simple tools used by Harboe to produce antibodies in rabbit blood for harvesting and use as a diagnostic tool in human illnesses. With the exception of the DIY electrophoresis machine, all the instruments could have been found in the visitor\u2019s personal home: sieves, vodka bottles, bottle capper, funnels, and more. In the exhibition, they provide a familiar cultural link to biomedical practice, and a bridge for the understanding of a wider public \u2013 a public we hoped to see coalesce before us through self-selection.[13] Extending this bridge, we displayed two live rabbits alongside this material: these were not lab animals, but pets. The intent was to bring human-animal relations into a kitchen-like context that invited visitors to relate the experience of pet-owning with issues of animals in biomedicine: distanciation can paradoxically bring one closer to the philosophical issues. Resolving this section of the exhibition involved some of the most complex of our discussions.And what of illuminating the epistemological and existential importance of the more mundane accoutrements of biomedicine? A particularly significant object which helped us begin to resolve this problematic had been collected by Sniff Andersen Nex\u00f8, whose research has focused on fertility and its technologies, foetuses, abortion and the social structures that create these practices and subsequently are created by them. An entirely non-descript plastic receptacle, only some ten centimetres tall, is a container for tissue which is the disposable part of a clinical abortion apparatus.[14] This container is a mobile component of a biomedical technological device, and it partakes of the degree of standardisation and industrialisation of medicine which is a hallmark of biomedicine today. This container in turn is also harnessed to a \u2018technology of power\u2019 \u2013 of legislation, for example, in relation to the European Union Tissue and Cells Directive. Concurrently, it is enmeshed in a contested field of social interactions which include notions of personhood. It became clear in discussion that the container itself in some social contexts (such as debates concerning the dates at which life is believed to begin after the moment of conception), is made to perform the inadvertent function of ascribing personhood to its contents, independently of the medical and legislative structures in which its use is set. Thus, this simple plastic object is actually incredibly volatile socially and has significant roles which it plays. In the highly contested arena of abortion, for some it \u2018contains\u2019 human remains, for others waste tissue. The very contour of the container itself seems to create the simulacra of personhood onto which is subsequently grafted a myriad of social, ethical and political projections. From the brainstorm discussion about this object came the realisation that all biomedical \u2018containment\u2019 and containers are a mechanism of the type of instantiation of personhood that we wished to address. This simple link became one of the core organising principles and leitmotifs of the exhibition through which we were able to connect directly to the visitor; the visitor for whom personal integrity might well be experienced \u2013 for better or worse, rightly or wrongly \u2013 as residing in the fragile impermeability of his or her liminal bodily contour. We began to look more closely at other biomedical containers from this point of view, to see how they might, within their delimited and defined \u2018spaces\u2019, similarly configure the ambiguities of various categories such as \u2018life\u2019, \u2018biohazard\u2019, \u2018genetically modified matter\u2019 and so on. Going from older and bigger hospital ceramics to newer and smaller containers for biomedical sampling of increasingly minute fragments of biological matter could also serve to trace the historical origins of these contemporary practices in earlier, larger-scale anatomical dissection. Containers also imply flow \u2013 flows of liquids from one container to another, flows of data from analysis of contained biomaterials, biomedical workflows, cashflows of biotechnology corporations. Because there has always been \u2018flow\u2019 in medicine, and containers to contain it. Museion\u2019s collection is rich in the stuff of medical history from Enlightenment on, and we chose a wide range of containers of varying materials, histories and use \u2013 for drugs, samples, serums, data and more. We used this material both historically accurately and metaphorically as an aid to highlighting the less visible, more conceptual \u2018flows\u2019 of contemporary biomedical processes, and we displayed it in a structure inspired by another apparently mundane object: the ubiquitous 96-well plastic microplate.\nThis plastic container, each well of which functions like a tiny test tube, has an alphanumeric grid for sample tracking, high optical quality plastic for throughput scanning, is stackable and storable hot or cold, radiation sterilisable, amenable to manual or machine manipulation and filling, can be heat sealed with foil or film, and is a central part of all research fields in life science.[15] As Susanne Bauer pointed out, its grid mirrors that of the punch card, and it is designed specifically to enable the tracing of digital data generated from the analysis of the biomaterials contained within each of its identifiable wells. It is a \u2018technology of production\u2019 of the first order: an instrument of analysis and computation that produces particular biological \u2018bodies\u2019 alongside its data \u2018corpus\u2019.Following a set of brainstorm meetings about the use of temperature in biomedical practice, which ranged from discussions about the PCR machine through to IVF incubators and cryogenics in biobanking, we realised that a laboratory Cold Room was a \u2018container\u2019 large enough to encompass even our visitors, and to give them a sensory understanding of not only the conditions of biomedical practice, but also a visceral experience relating to biosample storage. The Cold Room which we installed as part of Split + Splice was not only an actual instrument but also a phenomenological experience. It became one of our major exhibition objects, and a complex project management segment of the exhibition creation. Without the ingenuity of our Curatorial Assistant Jonas Paludan, its inclusion would not have been possible, and a core through-thread would not have had its major anchor.\nSo we chose objects, yes; but also temperatures, sounds, textures, films, animals, cameras and more. Of course, object choices are also intimately related to design problems, and we dovetailed our design process with our object selections \u2013 sometimes out of necessity rather than choice \u2013 and were very lucky to have been working with exhibition designers Mikael Thorsted and Lars M\u00f8ller Nielsen of Studio 8. The brainstorms and workshops which we held with our designers were no less intensive than those we had held as a core team. Fortunately they were interested in being so closely involved in the devising process of the exhibition, and the result showed their commitment to the project. Once again, knowledge pooled was also skills exchanged, and the time taken for exploratory discussion was rewarded by a high degree of innovation. Some of the issues we outlined to them in our Design Brief indicate the integrity of design with object choice and concept:\nThe biggest problem is how to create overall exhibition coherence without falsely totalising the information within it.\u00a0Everything in the exhibition must work towards grounding the visitor\u2019s body in their own senses, their phenomenological experience, and their subjectivity so we can get straight inside them \u2013 YET everything in the exhibition must work towards showing them how much their bodies are fragmented and displaced and reconstituted by biomedicine. A whole body is required in order to sense (and thus cognitively recognise) the body-in-pieces.\u00a0[...] We want to use objects as if they were explanatory texts for each other.[16]\nThis relationship between fragment and whole \u2013 both in the display itself and in the visitor experience \u2013 was ultimately rendered in a careful balancing act of contextualisation that kept objects and labels apart in the exhibition, and therefore invited the visitor to observe relations between things. We were asking them to hypothesise themselves, to draw their own deductions from our constellations of biotechnological instruments, consumables, techniques, processes, products, affects and more. We did everything we could to foster self-reflexivity on the part of the visitor: awareness of self as a sensing instrument, as a body moving through space, as a body with integrity at a large scale, as a body with a unique identity. Visitor flow, which had already been problematised in the workshops we had held early on with exhibition designer Calum Storrie, came into stark focus at this point. The grid of the gallery spaces and the sketch-up software used in the design process came out to meet the grid of the epidemiological computer punch card and of the plastic microwell. It became clear that there was a structural similarity to the ways in which the visitor would circulate in the exhibition and the ways in which biomaterials and data of all kinds circulate within biomedicine. This structural similarity of \u2018flows\u2019 became a foundational tenet through which we were able to display, alongside many objects, the very instant of engagement between a \u2018technology of the self\u2019 and a \u2018technology of power\u2019. At any given moment in the visitor\u2019s flow through the show, there was a concurrent instance of flow within a biomedical process to be pondered. In the strictly \u2018hardware\u2019 sense of the term, technologies are pivotal parts of processes \u2013 scientific and otherwise; technologies are both produced by processes and produce them. The reduction of technology to hardware which is in part unwittingly occasioned by museological focus on collecting objects rather than concepts has meant that instruments \u2013 biomedical and otherwise \u2013 are often the focal point of exhibitions which consequently explain the world in instrumentalist ways. When this is the only \u2018story\u2019 that is told, then only part of the story is being told. Split + Splice, and the way we constructed the exhibition, has shown that instruments can be employed in ways much more complex, metaphorical and allegorical; ways that point the visitor to the concepts and the processes that swirl around and through these technologies; ways that show the visitor the larger picture \u2013 of technologies of the self, of power, of signs, and of production; production that has produced the very \u2018hardware\u2019 in the display case before them. It is worth remembering that an exhibition, too, is a technology."},

Its development was funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) and it was created collaboratively by the University of Oxford and the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) Library and Archive Service. This article examines the development of the game and the opportunities and challenges of working with an audience of nurses. In the first section we will address the development of the game, how methods from museum studies were utilised to improve and enhance it, and who our target audiences were. We then focus on how and why we increasingly aimed the resource towards a key audience of nursing practitioners and students and the potential impact of doing so upon nursing education, as well as the medical humanities. Finally, we conclude by evaluating the outcomes and efficacy of the game, considering how Mind-Boggling Medical History has added value to nursing education, and showing how academic humanities researchers might contribute to healthcare education using intellectual tools borrowed from the museum sector.The origins of Mind-Boggling Medical History lie in a late-night public event called \u2018Wrong!\u2019, which was organised in July 2013 by the Wellcome Collection and curated by the theatre director Sarah Punshon. The event focused on ideas of error and irrationality in science and medicine. The authors, at the time doctoral students at University College London, came on board to co-design a medical history activity with the curator. We wanted to do something that would get museum visitors thinking critically about what it means to be right or wrong in medicine and how this might change with the passage of time. The result was a card game called The Unbelievable Truth of Medical History. The game challenged players to compete against one another to sort through a series of statements about theories or practices in medicine and put them into categories. They had to decide whether the theory or practice was from the history of medicine (\u2018past\u2019), formed part of current understanding (\u2018present\u2019) or was simply made up (\u2018fictional\u2019). From floating kidneys and wandering wombs to tobacco enemas and faecal transplants, the game took players on a tour of medicine and healthcare through the ages, asking them to delineate between past and present and fact and fiction.\nThe game often led to surprising discoveries on the part of players. The statement \u2018women have smaller brains than men\u2019, a measurement that remains true, on average, nonetheless sparked heated discussions about how brain size was used in the nineteenth century to support pre-conceived ideas about male superiority. In contrast, the statement \u2018every human personality trait corresponds to a particular part of the brain; the more you possess that trait, the bigger that part of the brain grows\u2019 related to a historical theory, setting the scene for introducing players to phrenology. However, many attendees, at both the \u2018Wrong!\u2019 event and other events where we showcased the game, assumed that this statement described an idea from modern day neuroscience. This generated conversations, for example, about the use of imaging to connect behaviour to brain structure and how phrenology, while deemed a pseudoscience before the end of the nineteenth century, nonetheless played an important part in the history of our understanding of the brain.\nThese early explorations proved that the game was a simple yet effective concept and inspired us to develop a more sophisticated educational resource, re-named Mind-Boggling Medical History. While intentionally bringing to light amusing and curious ideas from medical history, the game had serious objectives: to inspire discussion about the differences between past and present ideas, and to get people thinking about what is \u2018current\u2019 and who decides this. The inclusion of the fictional category added a twist to the game, showing how it is not always easy to distinguish fact from fiction when it comes to medicine, highlighting the role of the unexpected and unlikely in medical practice. Moreover, unlike fictional theories, past practices have had real effects on patient care, and are sometimes even rehabilitated after being previously discredited. This is illustrated, for example, by the card statement \u2018leeches are used to prevent soft tissue from detaching from the face in reconstructive facial surgery\u2019 (a present-day practice), which can be used to open up conversation about the recent resurgent interest in the ancient medical method of leeching. The game thus reminds the audience that the categories are not set in stone, and that best practice in medicine and healthcare is constantly re-evaluated.\nOn a practical level, our early sessions indicated that this simple game, if written in accessible language and freely available for distribution, could potentially reach far wider audiences than more traditional modes of academic communication such as blogs and seminars. With this in mind, we applied to receive a grant from the AHRC Follow-on Funding for Impact and Engagement Scheme to develop the resource, which we were awarded in 2017[1]. The grant solidified our focus on adapting the game into a resource directed at two key audiences: nurses, and secondary school students working at Key Stages 3 and 4. From the outset we had considered that the game could be a good fit with nursing education at university level and in the school history curriculum through the GCSE Medicine through Time option. Our confidence in its value for nurses was increased by test sessions at the RCN\u2019s annual congress in 2014 and 2015, a major event in the nursing calendar (our presence at which was facilitated by Sarah Chaney\u2019s role as Events and Exhibitions Manager at the RCN). The process by which we shaped the game to also be of value to a second audience of school history students is beyond the scope of this article, in which we limit our focus to the impact of the game upon nursing. Attempting to cater to two different audiences did, however, throw up a number of issues, not least the need to limit ourselves to language and terminology that would be clear and accessible to teenagers. It also became quickly apparent from feedback from secondary school teachers that whatever kind of resource we produced, it would only be useful to teachers if there was an accompanying lesson plan to go with it; few would have time to put together their own lesson plans to support the resource. This was not necessarily the same for a nursing audience, where we found nursing librarians and lecturers often preferred to incorporate the game into existing lessons.Fundamental to the game\u2019s development was the involvement of the Heritage Support Group (HSG) museum consultancy. HSG work with heritage sites, museums, community groups and galleries to build capacity and skills, helping organisations plan and achieve their heritage goals. Their involvement as independent museum professionals offered a degree of consistency and standardisation to the way evaluation was carried out. It also allowed us to receive additional, expert advice from museum professionals not attached to any of the institutions invested in the game. This was especially useful given that gamification is still a novel tool in academic history settings[2]. Conversely, in recent years, the role of games and play in aiding learning has been a subject of interest within museum and information studies, in the context, for example, of interactive exhibits and in the development of apps that can connect audiences to museum collections digitally (Cawston, et al, 2017; Rodley, 2011). As the digital access librarian Bohyun Kim has described it, \u2018gamification is the process of applying game-thinking and game dynamics, which make a game fun, to the non-game context in order to engage people and solve problems\u2019 (Kim, 2013). Interestingly, there appears to be little in the literature exploring connections between gamification and participatory practice in museums. With the publication of Nina Simon\u2019s The Participatory Museum in 2010, participation and community engagement has become an increasingly discussed aspect of museum work (Simon, 2010). Museums and museum staff aim to represent the communities they serve through collaboration and co-creation, while reflecting on and attempting to mitigate the risk of further marginalising certain groups through \u2018empowerment-lite\u2019 activities (Lynch, 2011)."},

After all, the very roots of the museum lie in physics in Leiden. Leiden physics reached its zenith with the appointment of Heike Kamerlingh Onnes as a professor in experimental physics in 1882. With a will of iron, tremendous perseverance, amazing powers of conviction, incredible vision and courage, he set himself the task of experimentally testing and expanding on the molecular theories of his friend and mentor Johannes Diderik van der Waals, with the aim of harvesting international acclaim for Dutch physics. To be able to implement his programme, Kamerlingh Onnes transformed the solid but somewhat sleepy teaching institute of his predecessor Rijke into a bustling research laboratory of international allure (Delft, 2007).As part of the operation, the collection of demonstration instruments of the Leiden Physics Cabinet, comprising lenses by Christiaan Huygens and the marvellous eighteenth-century demonstration appliances used by Jacob Willem\u2019s Gravesande in his lectures (and with which he attracted students to Leiden from all across Europe) was mercilessly relegated to the attic rooms of the laboratory. Air pumps, levers, collision devices, centrifugal machines: in Kamerlingh Onnes\u2019 world, they were above all obstacles. In 1887, a whole collection of lenses, the pendulum clock fitted with cycloid arcs, and a planetarium by Huygens were transferred to the Leiden Observatory, together with a number of old globes. In his annual report for 1887, Kamerlingh Onnes wrote, \u2018It was with some sadness that I bade farewell to these objects that originated with our great compatriot Huygens\u2019. The professor and director would have loved to have paraded them in his attic, he added, but \u2018in the absence of support\u2019 that was out of the question.Claude August Crommelin, appointed curator of the Physics Laboratory in 1907, took to heart the fate of this attic collection. Crommelin, who arrived in Leiden in 1898 and attained his doctoral degree under Kamerlingh Onnes in 1910, was born into an aristocratic family. A music lover (he played piano and cello and together with Ehrenfest and Einstein performed in a trio, whenever the latter was staying in Leiden), he was a fervent museum visitor with a keen interest in the history of the natural sciences. On the occasion of the fortieth anniversary of Kamerlingh Onnes\u2019 professorship at Leiden, he organised an exhibition in the Physics Laboratory with tables, drawings and graphs as well as original objects such as the magnet with which the Zeeman effect was discovered in 1896, and the fragile helium liquefier from 1908 (see Figure 1). Crommelin was fully aware of the cultural and historical value of these instruments, and guarded the well-being of the material heritage of his laboratory. In 1926, following Kamerlingh Onnes\u2019 death, he compiled a catalogue of the historical collection. It was to form the starting point for the foundation in 1928 of what was then called the Netherlands Historical Museum of Natural Sciences.\nThree years later, the museum opened its doors to the public. Right from the start, the collection also included items relating to medicine. Technology was welcome on condition it served fundamental research; such technical applications as an alternator were beyond the scope of the collection, as were domestic appliances. Crommelin travelled to all corners of the country to expand his collection. In 1947, the private Historical Museum of Natural Sciences was closed, and the Dutch Government formally took over its running. The new name reflected its ambitions: National Museum for the History of Sciences. A committee of advisors comprised of professors from all the universities underlined the fact that this was a national museum.Nonetheless, Leiden is heavily represented in the collection. Among the museum\u2019s most important pieces are the quadrant belonging to Snellius, the medical instruments of Solingen, the oldest herbarium in the Netherlands, a six metre-long extendable telescope by Huygens, the electrocardiograph with which Einthoven first recorded heart tones, the artificial kidney by Kolff, the collection of anatomical papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 models by Auzoux (see Figure 2), the meridian viewer from the Leiden Observatory and the Ploem\u2019s epi illuminator (a breakthrough in fluorescent microscopy) (Delft, 2007). The name \u2018Rijksmuseum Boerhaave\u2019 dates from 1976. The current location, somewhat hidden away in the very heart of Leiden, became home to the museum in 1990. The move represented a huge step forward in terms of floor space for the presentation of the permanent and temporary exhibitions. At present, the collection totals some 40,000 objects (95 per cent are kept in store), excluding the books, prints and archives. The museum employs around 35 full-time staff.\nIt is important to understand that Rijksmuseum Boerhaave was established for a completely different reason than, for examples, the Science Museum in London or the Deutsches Museum in Munich. Whereas in the establishment of the latter two museums the ideas of the Age of Reason played an important role, namely to enlighten and educate the general public by exhibiting the wonders of science and technology, the main reason for the establishment of Rijksmuseum Boerhaave was to preserve from destruction the museum\u2019s valuable collection (Bennett, 2006). Visitors were welcome (as long as they first rang the doorbell), but Crommelin was never truly the perfect host. The Dutch Historical Museum for Natural Sciences was aimed more at the educated elite, insiders capable of appreciating the intrinsic values of these scientific and medical instruments, without requiring further explanation. Museum director Crommelin was not against the idea of welcoming \u2018holidaymakers\u2019 who on a rainy day paid the museum a visit when there was nothing else to do, but his museum was above all the realm of a \u2018more enlightened public\u2019.This spirit of Crommelin was long upheld by the museum. When the author of this article became director in 2006, the main focus remained on the collection, while the public came in a clear second. Take for example the permanent exhibition at Rijksmuseum Boerhaave. The concept behind this exhibition dates from the late 1980s when the museum moved to its current location, the Caecilia Gasthuis (a former hospital). The permanent presentation, a chronological tour through 24 rooms, is hallmarked by its emphasis on aesthetics and the considerable focus on the object (see Figure 3). Indeed, it could be characterised as an altar to the scientific instrument. From clean-cut glass cases the observer is, as it were, \u2018granted\u2019 a view of these unapproachable instruments. In many places there is no clear context and the choice of object reflects no semblance of any hierarchy.\nAny visitor who lacks scientific or medical training rapidly feels overwhelmed and very much left to their own devices in this atmosphere so clearly intended for scholars. It is up to the individual to find his or her own way around the exhibits, and for children the experience is less than enchanting. Anyone taking in the permanent presentation in the accompaniment of an expert guide will gain much insight from the explanations. A visitor with no such guide, who as a result misses the accompanying stories and explanations of the complex instruments, soon becomes intimidated or engulfed by the apparent surplus (\u2018yet another glass case containing microscopes\u2019). Even the very best audio tour is not enough to brighten up such an exhibition. The biggest problem is that the people who actually worked with the instruments in practice are absent, and no attention is paid to the era in which they lived. It is for these reasons that over the coming years, Rijksmuseum Boerhaave intends to thoroughly overhaul its permanent presentation. In essence, the intention is less brass and glass, more flesh and blood and stories (Maas, 2010).An essential starting point for the new permanent presentation is a redefinition of the target groups for the museum. First of all, Rijksmuseum Boerhaave is more than an (inaccessible) mecca for connoisseurs of scientific instruments. The challenge lies in also making the museum attractive to culture-loving Dutch (and foreign) visitors, from the point of view of the vision that the natural sciences and medicines are not context-less activities, but form an integral and thoroughly embedded part of our culture. Numbers of both individual visitors and group visits (above all schoolchildren) can be considerably raised by increasing the attractiveness of the museum through a series of targeted interventions. As well as a new permanent presentation, these activities will include launching a \u2018Rijksmuseum Boerhaave Junior\u2019, laying out an educational water playground in the walled garden and extending the educational workplace Technolab, which provides classically-taught workshops in technical studies to schoolchildren between the ages of 4 and 14 years. This combination will result in an appealing range of educational facilities and will increase the attraction of the museum to families with children. None of these measures, however, mean that the museum will be prostrating itself to mere fun. Rijksmuseum Boerhaave will continue to focus fully on an audience wishing to learn something. People of all ages continue to demonstrate curiosity and a keenness to learn. Rijksmuseum Boerhaave does not intend to provide pretention-free enjoyment, but instead wishes to take up the challenge of placing sometimes difficult subject matter in the spotlight, in an attractive, accessible and playful manner. All of these objectives will have consequences for the permanent presentation. Any vital permanent presentation is permanently in flux. The most important change will be that Rijksmuseum Boerhaave will no longer be charting out five centuries of innovation in the fields of physics and medicine through what is (sometimes) a surfeit of interesting and/or aesthetically-pleasing instruments. Instead, the museum will tell a tale of primarily cultural history, whereby the history of science will be given a place in a broader sociocultural context \u2013 wherever possible with references to the present day. This story will be backed up by a careful selection of objects (along the lines of less is more) in order to provide sufficient space for laying out the relevant context. Further support will take the form of short films, photographs, animations and interactive ICT solutions (smart audio/video tour on PDAs or iPads), hands-on games, models, an attractive design and other more theatrical means of creating experience and action. In the new permanent presentation, the central figure will be man, while a story will be told that will be of interest to both young and old. A start has already been made on the development of the overall story. Both halls on the first floor of the museum containing the Leiden Physics Cabinet were redesigned on the basis of the principles outlined above (see Figure 4). The aim was to experiment with content, layout, storyline and design to inform future exhibitions, guided in part by lessons learned during the development of the earlier NewtonMania exhibition (December 2009\u2013September 2010). The project allowed the museum to investigate the response from the public while encouraging enthusiasm by other stakeholders (for example the Ministry of Education Culture and Sciences, the cultural funders, sponsors, etc.). Following on from this exhibition, the museum has developed an extensive plan for the phased restructuring. This plan should result in a completely renewed Rijksmuseum Boerhaave, one that offers real meaning and which can face the future with confidence."},

A few months later, SMG announced its plans to give a significant part of the photography collection held at the\u00a0National Science and Media Museum \u2013 one of the four institutions for which the umbrella group is responsible \u2013 to the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum in London. What has proved to be a controversial decision will see 400,000 objects, originally the collection of the Royal Photographic Society, and now categorised as \u2018art photography\u2019, relocated from Bradford to London (\u2018National Media Museum invest in science and technology\u2019, 2016). The news came as a particular surprise given the enthusiasm for (art) photography SMG had displayed as recently as September 2013, when \u2013 with significant financial backing from Sir Richard Branson and film producer Michael Wilson, among others \u2013 Media Space opened at the Science Museum with the express purpose of showcasing Bradford\u2019s impressive photography holdings (\u2018Media Space \u2013 Major new Photography and Art Gallery\u2019, 2013).\nThe unfolding news about Bradford ensured that when the conference took place at the end of March 2016, the panel in which I participated spoke not only of photography, but also to its wider social, economic and institutional contexts.\u00a0National Science and Media Museum Curator Colin Harding provided a sensitive account of photographer Percy Hennell, whom he identified as a significant figure in the histories of medicine, photography and portraiture. Hennell\u2019s extraordinary pictures of veterans following their treatment with plastic surgery frustrated straightforward disciplinary distinctions. Anthropologist Elizabeth Edwards examined cataloguing systems as acts of foreclosure, addressing some of the ways in which the imposition of categories can work to limit an understanding of photography and the societies that produce it. Both papers took on particular poignancy against the backdrop of the SMG decision, within the context of the Science Museum\u2019s recently opened Dana research centre, and as a consequence of the speakers\u2019 direct involvement with building the photographic culture of the National Science and Media Museum. Changes to the meanings of photography and their relationship to wider institutional contexts were at the heart of what I had to say then, and what I want to discuss again briefly now. In doing so, I offer a few thoughts on an exhibition I co-curated for Media Space and the\u00a0National Science and Media Museum in 2015. Revelations: Experiments in Photography focused on the ways in which nineteenth-century scientific photography radically expanded the visual field and, particularly, the importance of that change for the work of a wide range of modern and contemporary artists. I start by mapping our thesis and the ways it informed decisions regarding the design and installation of the show, in order to reflect on the relationship between viewers\u2019 experience of the exhibition, the forms of knowledge we aimed to produce, and the larger, external factors that powered our project. This is intended to spark a wider analysis of the interplay between photography and history, the histories of photography, and the social, economic and institutional contexts that shape them. I am particularly interested in the politico-economic forces that appear to be driving important changes within the UK museum landscape, and the unexpected manner in which these have resonated with ideas at the core of the exhibition I curated. Revelations was structured as a kind of constellation, through which we hoped ideas could encircle and enrich each other, wider contexts might activate latent concepts, and meanings could develop cumulatively. I try to do something similar in this essay, which \u2013 to be clear \u2013 does not provide a fully resolved, neatly delineated or self-contained argument. Instead, it represents an exploratory effort to make sense of something I cannot claim to understand entirely. That task appears to me to require a gentle rethinking of conventional academic writing. As the essay develops, I adopt an increasingly performative position within, not apart from, the subject discussed. I enact, as much as explain, the fundamentals of my (not-quite-an) argument. The exclusions and allusions this involves may, on one level, frustrate. But they may also possess the potential to allow text and readers to inhabit the experience of attempting to make sense of that most peculiar and unstable set of circumstances: the present."},

A number of experiences have led me to a long-term interest in this theme, which comes into sharper focus when we consider its prominent position in many forms of public culture. As a young historian of science, I was taught that hagiography was bad, and that biography was an old-fashioned genre which encouraged an unhistorical approach to the past of scientific knowledge. When working in a history department early on in my career, I was struck by how a colleague's wonderfully researched and written biography was treated as a not particularly serious work by some academics. Then the surge of interest in life-writing happened, and as I was working more on portraiture \u2013 the ways in which images and lives had been used to build reputations and forge strong bonds between people with shared interests in science, medicine and technology \u2013 it claimed my attention. For several years I taught a Masters-level module on heroism. My students showed me how deeply invested we still are in heroes \u2013 a point reinforced in all parts of the media \u2013 when they got highly emotional about certain figures, and were frequently reluctant to subject such responses to critical scrutiny. I learned that people associated with warfare and empire-building continue to exercise extraordinary allure, while remaining contentious. Around the same time, I became interested in the vogue for celebrating anniversaries, which often raise tricky questions about what, precisely, is being celebrated, by whom, and with what motives. When writing about portraiture, as I have been doing over the past two decades, the issues around heroisation are inescapable. I recognise that museums, especially those associated with science, are places where these matters are also debated, although in distinctive ways, since their very survival generally depends on public support for their work, and members of the public may indeed have a thirst for heroic figures, which is willingly met by the media in an age of celebrity.These phenomena touch many areas of study, including the relatively new field of public history. This has developed much more robustly in North America than elsewhere, although other countries are now becoming actively engaged in a field that possesses, among many other striking features, the capacity to bring academic historians into greater contact with the museums and heritage sector. These collaborations are complex partly because, although overlapping in some respects, each sector faces different challenges, and their distinct practices tend to spawn distinctive habits of mind. Important bridges and collaborations exist already, and there seems to be a strong consensus that these deserve to be strengthened further. The treatment of 'heroes' is possibly one area where tensions remain, and these are worth exploring. Heroism is the very opposite of a self-contained theme. I suggest that it can be used as a way into topics such as competitive nationalism in science, medicine and technology. It also illustrates beautifully the ways in which claims for the universal benefits of natural knowledge are mounted in contexts where elaborate interests are at work. Historians, whatever their institutional location, grapple with these complexities. Comparative approaches can help here, so that we do not treat science, medicine and technology in isolation, even as we analyse their distinctive characteristics. Considering heroism in a range of contexts, academic and museological, is one way forward, since talk of heroes is everywhere, and has been for centuries. In the worlds of science, medicine and technology, heroism has a special place. It is not surprising, then, that it features prominently in many science museums, nor that those who bring science to wide publics believe that it can act as a compelling bridge between specialists and non-specialists (see Figure 1). We speak, lightly, of heroes and villains, as if this were an unproblematic phrase, while the polarisation of good and bad is seen as an effective marketing tool that perhaps should not be taken too seriously. Historians of science tend to squirm when faced with the adulation of towering geniuses from the past, although many academic careers have been made by studying such giants, in whom there is generally a lot more interest than in those who are less well and warmly remembered. Having worked on Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (see Figure 3), who got evolution \u2018wrong\u2019 in the eyes of many people, I have long been keenly aware that he will never attract the sustained attention given to Charles Darwin (see Figure 2). \u00a0\nIndeed, I once heard a distinguished scholar ask \u2018Why would one study the 2.1s rather than the firsts?\u2019. Historians of science have developed robust answers to this question, which hinge on a refusal to impose anachronistic judgements on past figures and on a deep commitment to showing science in contexts that are as rich as possible. The languages of achievement are certainly intricate. Greatness and heroism, for example, are not precisely the same. Heroism is both difficult to define, and now used with increasing abandon in a context where people, especially celebrities, are highly commodified. We may think of celebrity culture as rather new, but in fact there are many historical precedents, especially when it became possible to disseminate images and texts cheaply and easily. I can assert that there is a tendency to heroise, if at all possible, those whose achievements are deemed extraordinary, while acknowledging that \u2018heroes\u2019 may have little in common with one another. The very idea is so alluring that it can be extended to non-human phenomena, such as machines, natural phenomena, journeys, and even historical periods.\nNestling in the previous paragraphs are some serious and intractable problems. They come to a head in science museums that use heroes and heroism to attract audiences, gain their attention and explain science's pasts to them. Immediately we can identify some of the difficulties. Heroism is a morally charged idea; many historians, and especially historians of science, have turned away from the idioms of winners and losers, goodies and baddies. How good, we might ask, as history, are presentations that use such moral criteria? However, these are mainly difficulties for professional historians. Then another problem presents itself: a culture-clash between public discourse and scholarship. Many museums aspire to be in touch with, and use, cutting-edge scholarship, much of which is highly critical of heroic languages in general and of the heroisation of specific individuals. Scholars seem to be increasingly keen to collaborate with museums and galleries. They are searching for places in museums where a critical vantage point can be acknowledged and developed, although it must be admitted that museological skills are not yet widely dispersed in academic environments, whereas many curators possess strong academic ones. History of science is not alone in its concerns about heroisation. There are suggestive comparisons with the art world to be made, where blockbuster shows, which make such an important contribution to the income of museums, trade on names that have the widest possible recognition value. We acknowledge that there have been long traditions of elevating (a few) artists to a special status, often spoken about in terms of genius, and certainly indebted to romantic notions of individuals struggling for recognition. Much history of art is devoted to such figures, despite some scepticism about the familiar cultural tropes involved. When it comes to museums, it is simply much harder to organise exhibitions around those whose names are less familiar, however worthy or important they were in their own times. Heroic narratives around a lone individual transcending adversity may be found in many contexts. Yet the international markets which trade in aesthetic heroism have no exact parallel in science. However, science does mobilise ideas about the benefits that knowledge of nature can bestow upon mankind, and these may become the basis of distinctive forms of heroism. As talk of various forms of heroism has proliferated in popular culture, scholars have become increasingly concerned to develop critical perspectives that do not take heroic discourse at face value. It may help to be more explicit about the origins of the scepticism about hero-talk. As history of science became increasingly professionalised after the Second World War and delineated as a specialised field, it joined mainstream history in setting past beliefs and actions in their contexts of production and dissemination, in turning away from present-centred, triumphalist stories of inexorable progress and in endowing those possessing values distant from historians' own with dignity and respect. That, at least, was what many historians of science professed. Thus there was a stage when biographies of renowned figures were treated as old-fashioned enterprises, no longer cutting edge in scholarly terms, and vulnerable to the charge of being hagiographic. This stage did not last long, although the disdain for hagiography remains. One of the most striking and valuable features of contemporary practices in the history of science is in fact the commitment to engaging with the major figures in all their biographical and intellectual richness. The attractions of working on such \u2018giants\u2019 include the complexities, the exhilarating intellectual challenges they present. Working on big names, whose significance is readily recognised, can be a smart move. In an era of intense competition for funding, these issues need to be acknowledged. Many such names figure prominently in science museums. Yet the gap between openly celebrating them and presenting them in a full and rich context, and from a critical vantage point, remains. The languages and idioms of heroism are perceived by academics in many fields as objects of study rather than as phenomena to be embraced. So I wonder whether there is a tinge of irony in the fact that many scholars still prefer to work on the well-known and widely acknowledged, and to reach wide audiences with their writings? The most sophisticated examples both trade on and develop critiques of heroism. Perhaps scholarly activities are more affected by public discourse, with its intriguing intersections with celebrity culture, than we like to think. A few contemporary scientists are indeed celebrities; in the UK the pop-star physicist Brian Cox is a particularly striking example. It is perfectly possible to analyse critically the phenomenon of celebrity science in the present day, just as it is to unpick the roles of heroic figures in the past. Such an approach may be intellectually satisfying, but it does not necessarily help those in museums who are mediating complex scientific concepts for general audiences. Ideally, people who earn their living by practising history are, more or less consciously, performing complex balancing acts between critical detachment on the one hand, and close engagement with their objects of study on the other. In so far as this is recognised and actively managed, it makes a valuable contribution to self-aware scholarship. Curators are fully part of such trends, while also being required to respond to institutional and broad political imperatives. Furthermore, we value self-awareness in the history of science precisely because the myth-making around science is so intense. These very same myths, however, are what in part draw people to visit science museums. By myths, I do not mean claims that are untrue, but rather compelling stories and ideas that are capable of being easily understood and exercising allure, and do not necessarily manifest themselves at the level of individuals. Space exploration, for example, possesses a kind of \u2018charisma\u2019 that remains separable from the best-known 20th-century cosmonauts. Here again, many historians prefer to explain the appeal of space travel rather than participate uncritically in its wonder. I would suggest that excitement about the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland is partly to be explained by its heroisation, its monumentality, even its cost. Exhibitions, such as the one on the Large Hadron Collider mounted by the London Science Museum in 2013, can certainly try to convey the large numbers of \u2018workers\u2019 involved, the unglamorous nature of much of what they do, and the importance of teams (see Figure 4). Such aspects of scientific work have been central to history and social studies of science for some decades now. But they are not what draw audiences to a museum. Rather, some sense of awe seems to be involved. Understanding wonder both in the past and the present is important, although that is still not the same as experiencing it at first hand. My arguments suggest that museums of science, technology and engineering face a particularly challenging task: that of creating accessible ties with the fields they represent, while drawing on scholarship that is rooted in critical distance, in scepticism, even cynicism.\nThere are no easy resolutions to be found for these tensions. Instead we must face up to the difficulties, and treat them as presenting challenges worthy of sustained attention. Furthermore, there is a special task for museums here, to find ways of speaking about science that avoid the moralising that is inseparable from talk of heroes. Possibly the intensification of celebrity culture has made it even harder to generate such alternatives. If so, then ethical questions are raised about whether it is responsible to use current assumptions about fame, achievements, power and influence in telling the stories about how knowledge of nature has been acquired in the past. Are there genuine alternatives? Other languages are available for those we might otherwise deem \u2018heroic\u2019. Colourful characters, forceful figures and leading lights are not moralised ideas, and might serve just as well as heroism when it comes to providing hooks that draw people into historical displays. This is to acknowledge that offering connections between visitors and those they encounter inside museums is a vital part of what museum professionals do. Such connections build upon the values and preferences as well as the senses of identity of diverse visitors. Thus it is undeniably important that girls and women should be offered the chance to understand the wide range of roles that females have performed in the past as they do in the present. The roles themselves vary from one context to another, but presenting individuals with whom visitors can identify is essential. Thus it certainly helps to acquire as sophisticated an understanding as possible of processes of identification. Showing something of the real lives of scientists can bring all the different constituencies involved together without anyone having recourse to what is actually a divisive moralising strategy of attributing 'heroism' to a select few. Indeed, there is a tough-minded defence of making people more prominent in science museums: science is a human creation. It therefore contains within it the full range of human activities and emotions. It is the responsibility of science museums to explain how science comes about, how socially and culturally complex it is, how profound its ramifications. This strategy is directly connected to one of the most important concerns of historians of science, namely \u2018practice\u2019 \u2013 the things that people do, believe and enact while undertaking what we call 'science'. Viewed in this way, and shorn of overt moralism, current museum approaches and professional history of science are perfectly compatible, at least in principle. It is worth noting that the vast majority of objects in the collections of science museums relate far more directly to ordinary \u2018business as usual\u2019 science than they do to the actions of the exceptional few, whose aura may indeed partly be created by the actions of museums, along with those who design stamps, make television and radio programmes, films (especially biopics), write popular biographies, and so on. The moral dimensions of heroism are extremely hard to purge on the ground. This is partly because heroic languages serve particular interests, especially in a political environment in which attracting funding into science, medicine and technology is a continual struggle. The public value of these domains is a central claim that is made above all to governments who are determining spending priorities. If such forms of knowledge are cast as a public good, then it is likely that those who create them most effectively will be endowed, if in some cases with considerable effort, with 'heroic' qualities. Commentators sometimes point out that there is 'good' science and 'bad' science. In this context, \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018bad\u2019 refer to standards that are generally accepted at the time as necessary for determining whether any given piece of research should be funded, published and taken seriously. \u2018Good' and 'bad' here certainly refer to value judgements, but they do not necessarily imply judging the moral worth of specific human beings. Criteria for evaluating research are somewhat abstract and of particular interest to philosophers of science, but they are not easy to display in a museum. It is considerably more compelling to present specific research, whether experimental or not, undertaken by particular people who lived in contexts that can be described and communicated to visitors. By its very nature, 'science' presents formidable challenges to those who seek to make it accessible to wide publics, which may be distinguished from those posed by \u2018art\u2019, for example. These differences include not just the specific standards by which sound knowledge is claimed to be generated, but the abstract, intellectually demanding content of much science. Both medicine and technology are more amenable to public presentation, museologically speaking. This is partly because of the artefacts they generate and use. But it is also because of the ways in which they appreciably touch everyday life. Hence those known to have helped \u2018conquer\u2019 disease are particularly warmly heroised (see Figures 5 and 6). \u00a0\nIt is undisputed that the vast array of phenomena we customarily corral together as \u2018science\u2019 touch day-to-day life too, but these can be far harder to explain and display. Furthermore, we tend to have, if in different senses, personal relationships with technicians and medical personnel upon which to build in generating understanding of technology and medicine. Such experiences, which are diverse, nonetheless offer bridges between individuals and groups with markedly different levels of knowledge and expertise. Biographical genres build on readers\u2019 understanding of their own lives, and they possess special significance in this context, partly because historians of science have been preoccupied for many decades with exploring ways of telling a rich life accessibly, without imposing crude, anachronistic categories upon it. Radio programmes are currently doing the same for contemporary science. The Life Scientific on BBC Radio 4 is a fascinating example; it manages to convey some of the subtleties of scientific research and the complex interplay between life and work, without indulging in hagiography. The personalities of scientists can act as useful hooks, although some notable figures may not in fact possess particularly enticing ones. This was certainly a problem in the past; for example, when it became customary to write memoirs of scientific figures after their deaths. Such memoirs were common by the 18th century. Cultural effort has long been expended on presenting science to publics of many kinds. What is capable of making any given figure alluring at a precise moment in time varies markedly. The success of the Science Museum's recent exhibition about Alan Turing illustrates the point. \u00a0Only a few decades ago, it would have been difficult to allude to his sexuality or to the unresolved circumstances around his early death quite so openly. Turing was a complex person, this much is clear from the memoir written by his mother, recently republished, together with an essay by his brother that tells a rather different story. The Turing we recognise in the early 21st century is a very particular kind of \u2018hero\u2019, one with whom it is easy to sympathise because his suffering and persecution can now be avowed in a setting where responses to his homosexuality are generally felt to have been inhumane (see Figure 7). \u00a0\nHowever, it is still necessary to guard against one common trope in accounts of scientific heroism, namely the scientist as victim, or as misunderstood outside specialised communities. Naturally there are strong desires within scientific circles to celebrate their most notable achievements, even if there is debate on the precise nature of such achievements. But such drives raise further questions. This time it is less a matter of tensions between professional historians and those who create accessible displays, than of fraught relationships between the urge to make assertions about national excellence and the most fundamental claim of all modern science, that its findings are significant precisely because they are universal. If the latter is true, then nationality should not matter, any benefit should in principle know no political boundaries, and competitive nationalism would be utterly inappropriate. Claims about the apolitical nature of science may be rhetorically useful, but they are intellectually limited. The practice of science is an intensely political business and in a range of ways. Historians of science can make a contribution by tracking each phenomenon case by case, showing exactly how it works. The successful campaign to bury Darwin in Westminster Abbey is an excellent example. Darwin's complex and changing relationship with Christianity is well known; it was neither his wish, nor initially that of his family that he should be buried in London among the nation's heroes (see Figure 8).\nHistorians can tease apart such intricacies in prose, but it is far harder for them to be fully confronted in public displays. Again, Lamarck provides a good example of this point. He was, and is, openly f\u00eated in France, but nonetheless for many commentators, he simply got it \u2018wrong\u2019. His statue in the Jardin des Plantes in Paris treats him as a precursor, who has been unjustly neglected (see Figure 9). \u00a0\nIt celebrates him unambiguously, presumably for reasons of national pride. The politics behind such heroisation include the intricate, long-standing rivalries between Britain and France. Such entanglements, which for historians get to the heart of the self-construction of scientific communities, are not easy to display. In any case doing so would involve being explicit about both competitive nationalism and claims about the universal benefits to be derived from science, medicine and technology, which could seem indecorous in the context of national and international museum displays. To conclude: we cannot resolve the issues I have been sketching in simply through more \u2018research\u2019, no matter how historiographically sophisticated. Rather, science museums might be conceptualised as zones within which conversations take place about them. It goes without saying that curators will want to generate and draw upon the most compelling research in a range of fields. The questions I have touched on here go far beyond science, medicine and technology, since they pertain to notions of leadership, cultures of celebrity, styles of biography, forms of identification, patterns of praise and blame, and the nature of public culture, and these touch all citizens in all countries. If science museums could provide opportunities for well informed debate about such matters, they would be able to show how useful a critical take on \u2018heroism\u2019 can be, and also how \u2018science\u2019 participates fully in its parent societies. It would be good to see a concept as powerful and contested as \u2018heroism\u2019 not exploited, but opened up for lively discussion. In the process, biographical genres, seen by some as \u2018traditional\u2019, could become the handmaiden for fresh debates around science, medicine and technology.\nFurther reading\nI have discussed some of the issues mentioned here in Defining Features: Scientific and Medical Portraits 1660-2000 (London), especially in chapter 3 on 'Gender and Scientific Heroism', and in my contribution to Hoock, Holger (ed), 2007, History, Commemoration, and National Preoccupation: Trafalgar 1805-2005 (Oxford), pp 7\u201319. I find Geoffrey Cubitt and Allen Warren (eds), 2000, Heroic Reputations and Exemplary Lives (Manchester), extremely useful, especially the introduction; see also Cubitt\u2019s edited 1998 volume Imagining Nations (Manchester). The literature in the history of science that touches on \u2018heroism\u2019 is vast. I have been particularly struck by changing approaches to Darwin, for example, Adrian Desmond and James Moore, 1991, Darwin (London). Pertinent to my comments here is James Moore, 1995, The Darwin Legend (London). Janet Browne\u2019s, 2006, Darwin\u2019s Origin of Species: a Biography (London) neatly illustrates a number of trends, as does Edward Marriott\u2019s, 2002, Plague Race: a Tale of Fear, Science and Heroism (London). Work on Darwin and other major scientific figures, such as Newton, has done much to raise the status of biography.Two studies of biography in the history of science are helpful: Shortland, Michael (ed), 1996, Telling Lives in Science: Essays on Scientific Biography (Cambridge), and S\u00f6derqvist, Thomas (ed), 2007, The History and Poetics of Scientific Biography (Aldershot).Christine MacLeod\u2019s 2007, Heroes of Invention: Technology, Liberalism and British Identity, 1750-1914 (Cambridge) is a valuable study. She discusses James Watt, who was in some ways an unlikely hero, at length. Many British universities now contain centres for, and offer courses in, life-writing. The distinguished biographer Hermione Lee has written an excellent brief account of biography as a genre in her 2009 book Biography: A Very Short Introduction (Oxford), see also her 2005 book Body Parts: Essays in Life-Writing (London). That notions of genius remain current in art history is evident from John House, 2010, The Genius of Renoir (New Haven and London). Also relevant are: Myrone, Martin, 2005, Bodybuilding: Reforming Masculinities in British Art 1750-1810 (New Haven and London), and Junod, Karen, 2011, Writing the Lives of Painters: Biography and Artistic Identity in Britain 1760-1810 (Oxford), since they cover such a crucial period of change with respect to \u2018romantic\u2019 ideas of heroism. Gender is of fundamental importance for thinking about heroes and their construction. On Turing, see Turing, Sara, 2012, Alan M Turing, Centenary Edition (Cambridge).In the UK, the links between universities and museums are being strengthened because of the so-called \u2018impact agenda\u2019, where the \u2018impact\u2019 of research is evaluated as part of the Research Excellence Framework, and also through funding for Collaborative Doctoral Awards, allowing students to be supervised in both a museum and an academic department. See also John Christie\u2019s essay on 'The Development of the Historiography of Science' in Olby, R C, et al. (eds), 1990, Companion to the History of Modern Science (London and New York), pp 5\u201322, which outlines the state of play, including with respect to biography, at the end of the 1980s."},

Museums fully embraced the so-called 'deficit model' of science communication: a model where the public was considered to have a deficit of knowledge, and the organisations responsible for science communication were supposed to fill it (Wynne, 1992; Gregory and Miller, 1998). The 'deficit model' is very similar to what Zahava Doering described in 1999 as the 'baby bird' model of museums audiences, commonly found in museums of all kinds, '...which regards the visitor as a relatively undeveloped appetite needing our wise and learned feeding' (Doering, 1999).\nDuring the 1990s, this one-way form of communication began to be criticised for being inadequate, especially with regard to contemporary, controversial and 'unfinished' science (Wynne, 1992; Miller, 2001; Durant, 2004). The information and knowledge about contemporary science to be transferred to the public was by definition incomplete, volatile and uncertain; it became increasingly difficult to 'exhibit' such information and present it to the public in the traditional way. Influential policy documents stated that science had to regain public trust and be accountable, as did the institutions communicating it (House of Lords, 2000). The one-way, top-down model of communication through exhibitions was replaced by the 'engagement' model: exhibitions and programmes aimed at engaging the public in a debate about the implications of science and research; the focus shifted from the content to the context of science, that is, its social implications. The change in museology was visible: exhibitions started to explore the most contemporary aspects of science and, rather than providing incontrovertible facts, they were built around questions, with the museum helping visitors find their own answers. A wide variety of programmes for all audiences became a fundamental component of each exhibition.\nHowever, the engagement model also revealed some shortcomings. This model appeared not to recognise fully the competences that the public hold, and that are fundamental for the development of science and technology in contemporary society (Collins and Evans, 2002). Having an arena of dialogue and debate is important, but it became increasingly clear that the follow up to those debates is as important as the opportunity to have them. Science communication happens not only between scientists and the public, but involves a complex network of stakeholders, all of which need to be involved in the conversation. Together these stakeholders set the direction of science and shape its agenda. The contribution of the public is therefore necessary for the development of science, and for what is today called Responsible Research and Innovation, or RRI (Owen et al., 2012). Science centres and museums could thus be conceived as active players in the development of policies regarding the relationship between science and society and this was reflected in their inclusion in the funding streams of the European Commission. Through numerous collaborative projects, European museums have demonstrated their capacity to act not only as forums for discussion, but also as brokers able to convey the public\u2019s ideas, opinions, desires and fears to a vast network of stakeholders. Museums have therefore become 'full players' in the governance of science.\nDuring the late 1990s and early 2000s, the involvement of science museums in policy was rather episodic and it was mostly prompted by European funded projects under the Framework Programmes 5 and 6 aimed at investigating the possible roles of museums in this field. However, in very recent years there has been a discernible tendency to make such involvement structural. For instance, the PLACES project ran for four years and left a legacy consisting of a network of seventy partnerships between local administrations and science centres which continue to develop science communication policies at local and regional level. The VOICES project, a collaboration between 27 science centres and museums from all European countries, represented the first formal exercise promoted by the European Commission to involve citizens structurally in setting the priorities of the Horizon 2020 research agenda of the Commission. In the European project RRI TOOLS several science centres are the strategic hubs of this major initiative which has the ambitious goal of developing the main tools to implement RRI in the current European framework programme for research and innovation.\nAs a result, museums are not only a location where public participation takes place, but they can be involved as institutions in the organisation, management and decisions relating to the policies discussed by the citizens. Visitors participate in discussions at the museum, and museums participate in discussions with policy makers. The mutual influences of these roles are increasingly more complex and intertwined. They impact how museums are perceived by their visitors and in broader public opinion. The dialogue that takes place in science centres has a significant impact outside the walls of the particular institution; it ends up influencing a wide range of stakeholders on matters of science and society. Thus science centres and museums belong to the increasingly expanding and important network of places of informal engagement with science which bridge informal, policy-free settings with politically motivated activities (Stilgoe et al., 2014).\nMuseums often work together on policy-related projects, but implementation is affected by the context in which each museum operates. There are substantial differences across European countries in terms of science communication culture, public participation infrastructure, and presence and activity of science centres and museums. In order to compare the state of science communication culture across Europe, Mejlgaard et al. propose an analysis based on six parameters: the degree of institutionalisation (e.g. regular science sections in newspapers; dedicated TV programmes, etc.); political attention to the field; scale and diversity of actors involved; academic tradition; public interest in science and technology; training and organisation of science journalism. Countries that report intense activities on three or more of these parameters have a 'consolidated' science communication culture; these are primarily western European countries. Countries where there is a tendency towards improvement on at least one of the six parameters have a 'developing' culture: these are primarily smaller countries and some eastern European countries. The third group of countries is characterised by low performance on all the parameters, and it includes eastern European countries, mostly from the south-east part of eastern Europe (Mejlgaard et al., 2012).\nRask et al. conducted a similar analysis on the national infrastructures for public engagement in science and technology. Their study considered the degree of formalisation of the following procedures in each country: involving civil society in formal science and technology bodies; stakeholder consultations; direct democracy; public debates on techno-scientific themes; technology assessment and foresight; deliberative democracy; transnational and European projects; E-engagement. The results show that western European countries have implemented more formalised systems for public participation than eastern European countries, and to a large extent the same divide can be seen between northern European countries and southern European countries (Rask et al., 2012). Finally, membership data from Ecsite show that in eastern Europe there are far fewer science centres and museums than in western Europe.\nIn selecting the institutions for this study, we considered these differences and formed a balanced and diverse sample of national science centres and museums from countries belonging to all of the above groups: consolidated, developing, and fragile science communication, and high and low levels of public participation. In terms of the role of the institutions in policy, all the institutions within this study have recently participated in at least one European project related to science policy. The participation of science centres in European projects is thus one indicator of their emerging role in science policy. However, many of these projects are not sustained over longer periods and are visible only to small audiences, usually because they are designed to involve a limited public (such as the project VOICES, for example, which is based on focus groups) or because they rely substantially on programmes rather than exhibitions (specific programmes are ephemeral and normally engage fewer visitors than physical exhibitions). Moreover, regardless of the participation of the museum in policy related projects, there can be a big difference between what visitors expect and what museums perceive as their role in science policy (Cameron, 2012). Therefore the first question of this study addresses the awareness among museum visitors generally that there might be a role for science centres in policy:\nRQ1: To what extent are visitors aware of the role of museums in public policy, and how do they see it evolving in the future?\nThe second question investigates whether the awareness of the role of museums in policy affects public participation in the museum. More specifically, it investigates the extent to which this awareness compares with visitors\u2019 existing interest and engagement with science in affecting their level of participation in the science centre. The question distinguishes two forms of participation: sharing opinions and comments with other visitors and with the museum, i.e. the 'forum' function of the museum, and visitors\u2019 interest in co-developing programmes and exhibitions within the museum. \nRQ2: How are engagement with science and awareness of a policy role for science centres related to public participation in the museum?\nThe last question covered by this study concerns the interest of the public in a more structural form of participation in the museum, namely in its governance. While the discourse around this issue is very broad, in this study we want to focus on a democratic, normative argument in support of public participation in the governance of museums. In a democracy, citizens should be able to participate in the decisions that affect their lives. So if science centres can influence public policy (Bell, 2009; Laurent, 2012) and therefore the lives of citizens, it can be argued that citizens should also be able to participate in the decision making process leading to these policies. The third question of this study looks therefore at the interest of visitors in participating in the decision-making process of the museum:\nRQ3: Do visitors think that the public should participate in the governance of the museum?"},

He stamped his own character on the Museum and was a significant historian of chemistry and of science more broadly. These achievements have been captured in other obituaries and in Chymica Acta, a combined autobiography and festschrift published on his 90th birthday in 2007. However, this article will focus on the continuity he provided in the Museum\u2019s history, a further accomplishment that has yet to be fully appreciated. Greenaway was the most distinguished scholar at the Science Museum for many years, keeping alive the embers, and occasionally the flames, of research single-handedly.\nGreenaway (as he was known in the style of the times) was born in Cardiff in 1917. He studied chemistry at Jesus College, Oxford, before serving in the Second World War as a bomb disposal officer. After teaching chemistry in Bournemouth and at Epsom Grammar School, he worked at Kodak in Harrow.\nGreenaway joined the Science Museum as an Assistant Keeper in 1949 and became a Deputy Keeper ten years later. The Museum was still a young institution, for it had only acquired its independence in 1909 and, in contrast to the great art museums, the interpretation of the past in the Museum at the time was closely linked to the display of contemporary scientific and industrial practice. The collections acquired over the previous century by the Science Museum and its predecessors did include historic artefacts, although storage facilities were still limited. Above all, a significant collection reflecting Britain\u2019s great engineering heritage, partly a legacy of the earlier Patent Office Museum, linked the exhibits of the East Hall to the Industrial Revolution.\nWhen Greenaway arrived, chemistry at the Science Museum was the responsibility of the Imperial College-educated chemist Alexander Barclay, who had joined the Museum in the aftermath of the Great War in 1921. Barclay was an active collector and had built up the presentation of his subject for the opening of the building in 1928. His great interest was photography, but his publications were limited to catalogues of his collections.\nIn 1950, soon after Greenaway started work, another Oxford-educated chemist became the Museum\u2019s Director. A veteran of the First World War, with a brother who lost his health and ultimately his life to gas warfare, Sherwood Taylor had been part of the move after 1918 to prove that science was humanistic (see Figure 1). In 1931 he had made the then unusual step of formally studying the history of science, taking a PhD on the alchemy of the ancient Greeks in Britain\u2019s first History of Science department under Charles Singer at University College London (UCL). Four years later he was one of the three founders of the Society for the History of Alchemy and Early Chemistry and took the role of editing its journal, Ambix. He taught chemistry in schools and at Queen Mary College (where his own mentor the chemist and historian JRR Partington taught) and was briefly a full-time writer, becoming in 1940 the Curator of the Museum of the History of Science at Oxford, which had also been founded as part of the humanistic interpretation of science after the First World War. Sherwood Taylor thus brought to the Science Museum two decades of experience as a scholar and curator, which would strongly influence the novice curator Frank Greenaway (Simcock, 1987).\nWithin a short time of his appointment at the Science Museum, Sherwood Taylor was in conflict with his most senior curatorial staff. Unlike them he was interested in the place of science in culture, in alchemy and in religion. His enthusiasm for the popularisation of science and technology was evidenced by his acquisition of Coalbrookdale by Night, a painting which was a technically incorrect yet culturally important representation of the industrial revolution. Overwhelmed by administrative work and feeling isolated, Sherwood Taylor soon became unwell. Nonetheless, he proved a powerful influence on Greenaway who served as his assistant in his historical work. For example (as he indicated in his Oxford Dictionary of National Biography article on Sherwood Taylor), Greenaway completed the older man\u2019s history of industrial chemistry and saw it through to press after he died at the beginning of 1956. As Director, Sherwood Taylor had a short tenure, but through Greenaway his interest in history and early chemistry, and his broad humanistic perspective, was maintained.\nGreenaway was encouraged by Sherwood Taylor to pursue the history of chemistry, and took the MSc in the history of science at UCL where Taylor himself had studied. This further inspired Greenaway\u2019s interest in early modern chemical techniques. In Chymica Acta he recalled the impact of the \u2018Scientific Change\u2019 conference held in Oxford in 1961. That meeting brought him into contact with the new professional discipline of the history of science that was only just emerging, and in which British historians were leaders within Europe. He met for instance the encyclopaedic, and already very senior, historian of Chinese science and embryologist, Joseph Needham. Not himself a prolific publisher, Greenaway later described (in Chymica Acta) how he served the new discipline of history of science through his role on committees, the editing of reports and journals and international travels. Never before had there been a curator at the Science Museum with his wealth of international contacts and interests, which helped to establish the Museum at a global level. At the same time Greenaway was securely British, happy to be a member of the Athenaeum Club, and with a sense of the appropriate use of language that was part of the Museum\u2019s civil service tradition. When one of the present authors, then newly appointed, annotated a minute with the comment \u2018OK\u2019, the reprimand \u2018\u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d, not \u201cOK\u201d\u2019 followed immediately.\nAs well as working and networking, Greenaway did contribute himself to the growing literature on history of science and earned his place in academic circles. In addition to early chemistry instrumentation such as blowpipes, he was particularly fascinated by the great Manchester chemist John Dalton. In 1958, he published a contribution on Dalton to the Memoirs of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society that was converted into a book in 1966 and, with the support of his teacher at UCL, a range of his work on Dalton was accepted as a thesis for a PhD in history of science in 1971 (Greenaway, 1971).\nGreenaway was the first Reader of the History of Science at the Royal Institution (RI) between 1970 and 1985. There, he sponsored a seminar series that would be the basis for the history of science seminar series subsequently organised at the Science Museum. Even beyond the RI he was an ambassador for the history of science - for instance, in the mid-1970s he encouraged Peter Morris, a co-author here but then a beginning chemistry student. After his retirement, Greenaway continued to work at the Science Museum as a Research Fellow until 1991 and published a commissioned work The History of the International Council of Scientific Unions five years later (Greenaway, 1996).\nGreenaway was not only an enthusiastic promoter of scholarship; he was also a discoverer of excellent people and he and his staff had a significant impact on the Museum floor. In the 1970s, having been promoted to Keeper of Chemistry in 1967, he recruited a remarkable team. Anne Newmark was initially a Research Assistant with special responsibility for biochemistry, whilst Derek Robinson, responsible for industrial chemistry and the gas industry, and Robert Anderson, in charge of pure chemistry, were appointed as Assistant Keepers. Together they renovated the huge chemistry galleries at the front end of the building that Greenaway had constructed in 1963\u201364, the entire exhibition area being honoured with a royal opening on the occasion of the centenary of the Royal Institute of Chemistry in 1977. Beyond chemistry, Greenaway also initiated the process of acquiring for the Science Museum a huge collection of medically related artefacts from the Wellcome Trust, a collection that roughly doubled the museum\u2019s entire existing collection (see Figure 2).\nGreenaway also encouraged his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s to build on his interest in the history of science as a discipline. Robert Anderson, later Director of the National Museums of Scotland and of the British Museum, had already distinguished himself in his previous job at the Royal Scottish Museum with a catalogue of the collection of the great 18th century chemist James Black. At the Science Museum he followed Greenaway\u2019s lead in extending research within the history of science. Thus, at the British Society for the History of Science he too presented in the same session as Joseph Needham and he too became a leader in the history and appreciation of scientific instruments. In 1978, Greenaway also recruited Robert Bud (a co-author here) as Assistant Keeper of Industrial Chemistry, the Museum\u2019s first already-trained historian of science, who was completing a PhD at the University of Pennsylvania.\nRobert Anderson and then current curators Robert Bud, Peter Morris and Tim Boon built on several of the traditions that Greenaway established in promoting historical research at the Science Museum, successively carrying the torch that Greenaway himself had inherited from Sherwood Taylor towards the end of the Science Museum\u2019s first half-century. That tradition is still bearing new fruit with the recent creation of the Research and Public History department and the imminent opening of a new Research Centre, in 2015."},

Miley was over a hundred years old and could recall the first white missionaries who had come to the island. Perhaps for this reason, she refused to speak to whites. Her great-grandson relayed the story that the missionaries were believed to procure fire from their fingertips. From this perspective, the matches that the missionaries struck were incidental to the effects of fire that were clearly the result of intentional physical and chemical reactions located in the bodies of those who produced them. While this idea may at first seem counter intuitive, its material logic places emphasis on cause rather than effect, reminding us that such an act does indeed require certain physical and chemical changes in the body of the user.\nThe spectacle of a lit match to those who have no previous knowledge of such an object might undoubtedly evince a weird magic, contributing to the authority of the missionary project and its \u2018civilising\u2019 remit. While the Bougainvillian woman had clearly never been exposed to the manufacturing or scientific basis of the match, it seems even more strange that those of us who have fire at our fingertips every day are no more informed about the complex chain of physical causality that make such ghostly procurements possible. For example, the technology of the match was a long time in progress. Early chemical matches were too dangerous to reach mass use or production and it was only with the use of the chemical element phosphorous that industrial scale production of matches was realised (Wisniak, 2005, p 370). Phosphorous is a chemical element essential to all life while being highly reactive in isolation (Chun and Kindel, 2019). It is distributed in minerals as phosphates and was first extracted from human urine samples by Brandt in 1669, later manufactured commercially from concentrated animal bone (Hughes et al, 1962, p 84). Today, it is mined from phosphate rock (ibid). Match heads require oxidisable matter in order to catch light, and in their initial manufacture it was the pyrophoric white (sometimes \u2018yellow\u2019) phosphorous that seemed most suitable (Barnett, 1919, p 163). However, white phosphorous soon became associated with phosphorous necrosis of the jaw, or phossy jaw, \u2018the most terrible of the industrial diseases\u2019 (Hughes et al, 1962, p 83). The fumes of white phosphorous were gradually understood to corrode the gums and loosen teeth, eventually to \u2018denude\u2019 the jaw bone which, with \u2018fetid suppuration\u2019, would come away from the skull (ibid, 88). The disease led to permanent disfigurement and, in twenty per cent of cases, death (ibid, 83). Bearing such indirect chemical reactions in mind, it is hardly a leap to imagine that flames might issue from the tips of fingers. Today, it is not just fire, but the world as information that is procured through the intentional physical and chemical reactions of our own bodies, as well as the bodies of an invisible workforce. Let us first consider some of today\u2019s smartphone touchscreen technology from the vantage of such magic, where the user\u2019s body is instrumental in the production of an electric circuit. Indeed, through the touchscreen, the notion of our fingertips procuring flickering images becomes a literal case in point. Capacitive touchscreens are also capacitators, which means they are electrical circuits that store electricity, composed of two conductive electrodes and separated by an insulating gap (Rohig, 2015). In order to conduct electricity, the glass screen is coated with a transparent layer of conductive substance \u2013 usually the chemical element indium tin oxide \u2013 forming a grid which stores a small electrical charge (ibid). Indium tin oxide is a composition comprising chemical elements oxygen, indium and tin, the latter two being also metals. When pressed by a finger, the screen\u2019s voltage drops at the point of pressure and a tiny amount of electrical charge enters the finger, due in part to a combination of moisture and salt in the skin allowing it to conduct electricity (ibid). By holding the device with our other hand, the electrical circuit is complete, looping to its back, which is electrically grounded (Saini, 2011). In short, we complete the electric circuit by conducting electrical current. The tips of our fingers procure not only fire, but electrical current enough to summon entire networks of global information. In so doing, they evince a spectacle of alchemical supremacy that appears to efface their violent and unethical supply chain."},

Indeed, the official title of the latter, the National Museum of Science &amp; Industry, seemed to make that point clear. An indication that change was in the air was an announcement early in 1973 by the Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine that negotiations had begun with the Science Museum for the transfer of its very extensive collections to South Kensington. These had originally been garnered under the guidance of Sir Henry Wellcome up to the time of his death, in 1936. The institute\u2019s rationale for this change was that it wished to concentrate on becoming a centre for research at postgraduate level, based on its library, and that it was intending to form an association with the University of London. The change was being strongly promoted by the Keeper of Chemistry at the Science Museum, Frank Greenaway, who was advising his Director, Margaret Weston. A transfer agreement was formalised in June 1976. The collection was to be transferred on indefinite loan and a new department would be established, the Wellcome Museum of the History of Medicine. Funding was to be made available for five years, after which the Science Museum would assume financial responsibility. The next thing to do was to set up the new department and the post of Keeper of the Wellcome Museum was advertised. The successful candidate was Brian Bracegirdle, who joined the Science Museum in 1977. On leaving school Brian, who came from Macclesfield in Cheshire, had first worked for ICI\u2019s dyestuffs division. His degrees were taken extramurally and he developed a passion for microscopy. From 1964 until 1976 he taught biology at a London college of education. He also developed a deep interest in industrial archaeology, a discipline then in its infancy, which he centred on Ironbridge in Coalbrookdale, Shropshire, described as being the home of the Industrial Revolution in England. Before he had arrived at the Science Museum he had published The Archaeology of the Industrial Revolution (1973), Thomas Telford (1973) and The Darbys and Ironbridge Gorge (1974). Perhaps more importantly to him, he had authored many books on medical, zoological and botanical topics, illustrated by high-quality photographs he had taken himself (he was an expert photographer). About ten of these atlases came out between 1966 and 1978 (some co-authored with his wife, Patricia Miles, and others), and there was the same number of books about current microscope technique and its history, up to 1995. Brian was an astonishingly prolific writer.\nAs Keeper, Brian set about his task of establishing a new department, hiring staff and having them register, using newly developed computer techniques, between 100,000 and 165,000 objects (depending on how they were categorised; some were transferred to other, more appropriate museums). He also created a library of medical works, set up an acquisition policy (memorably, he had said to a journalist, \u2018Mind you, I don\u2019t want to be sent everyone\u2019s old trusses\u2019) and established two large galleries illustrating the history of medicine. All this was achieved in five years. To stick to this timetable he had to be brisk and impose his briskness on his staff, of whom there were about 30 at the peak. Most of these were cataloguers, working in a somewhat basic warehouse in Enfield, in the basement storage area of the Euston Road building, and in the Science Museum itself. He was a strict manager, which suited some and not others, but he was an effective choreographer. The department certainly felt a sense of driven mission. Brian took a particular interest in one of the galleries, which he curated himself. This was Glimpses of Medical History, a series of large-scale reconstructions including, for example, Thomas Beddoes\u2019 Pneumatic Institution at Bristol in the 1790s and a contemporary operating theatre for open-heart surgery. These were interspersed with small-scale dioramas previously displayed in Euston Road. This, the first permanent medical display ever seen in the Science Museum, was opened by Princess Alexandra in December 1980. The upper Wellcome gallery was larger and more complex in its organisation. It was curated by Christopher Lawrence (who had earlier worked as a general practitioner), seconded from the Wellcome Institute as its Senior Medical Historian, and Robert Anderson, seconded internally from the Chemistry Department, of which he was Keeper. Also key to the curation of the new gallery was Ghislaine Skinner, appointed Assistant Keeper in 1979. Installation of the gallery was under the control of Derek Robinson, a chemist who became Keeper of Museum Services. The basic premise of the gallery was to display Sir Henry Wellcome\u2019s collection in all its chronological and cultural breadth, while making sense of topics in medical history that could be illustrated by material objects. Opened in 1982, the result was, unsurprisingly, large and complex. The two galleries had a long lifetime, only being dismantled in 2016.\nThese massive tasks having been achieved, the department settled down to a more normal existence. The library continued to grow with Wellcome support and acquisitions were sought to represent more recent medical practices. Registration of the collection continued. The Second Conference of the European Society of Medical Museums held some of its sessions at the Science Museum in 1984. Margaret Weston retired in 1986 and Neil Cossons was appointed Director. Brian assumed the newly created post of Head of Collections (though only in an \u2018acting\u2019 capacity) in the following year. It is no secret that frequently he did not see eye to eye with the new Director, and Brian was ousted in 1987 under an early retirement scheme. He became a Museum Fellow and worked at Blythe House on microscopes. Here he was able to concentrate on doing what he had long sought, to create the definitive catalogue of the huge and comprehensive microscopy collection. Many of these objects had entered the Science Museum much earlier as the Clay and Court Collection. After many years\u2019 work, this mammoth task resulted in A Catalogue of the Microscopy Collections at the Science Museum, London, which as issued as a CD. He took early retirement in 1989. Brian did not have a subtle personality, though his toughness suited the task at hand. He was a determined fighter, which was made clear when he had a severe heart attack in the Alps and required a triple bypass operation. He recovered fully and even this did not keep him away from the Museum for long. He enjoyed being sociable with particular friends and he could be a warm host. He started organising annual port parties at his home in Limerston Street, Chelsea, for his male friends; they were most definitely for those who possessed trencherman\u2019s appetites. These continued when he moved out of London, to Cold Aston in the Cotswolds. Here it was that he indulged in another of his obsessions, large-scale model railways, with trains running round his garden. Eventually he moved to Cheltenham, and it was there that he died. He specified that there was to be no funeral or memorial, and that his body was to be bequeathed for the purpose of medical education. It seemed particularly apt, a few months after Brian Bracegirdle\u2019s death, for the annual reunion of Science Museum staff to take place for the very last time in the Fellows\u2019 Room*, surrounded by the thousands of books that had been acquired by Brian to create a working library for his newly established department.\n* This part of the building had recently been sold to Imperial College.\n\u00a0\nFurther readingBoon, T, 2010, \u2018Parallax error?

Her research output was prodigious in the histories of the earth sciences, scientific instrument-making and scientific biography, she authored 17 books, and was awarded fellowships of the Royal Geographical Society, Royal Society of Arts and Royal Meteorological Society. Although her entry in the Science Museum\u2019s Science for the Nation only describes her as a Senior Curator between 1985 and 1988, she started work there as a Museum Assistant in December 1963, and went on to coordinate the removal of railway material from Clapham to what would become the National Railway Museum in York. She also ran the Science Museum\u2019s store at Hayes in Middlesex, prepared permanent displays of oceanography and geophysics in 1977 along with their attendant catalogues and handbooks, and embarked on a body of research work that stands as her testimony.\nMuch of what follows comes from a memoir that Anita was asked to write a few weeks before her death. She was born on 22 January 1936 of Italian parents who both worked in the catering trade. With the outbreak of the Second World War her father was prevented from working, so her British mother had to support the family. Anita was sent to live with her maternal grandmother. Because of wartime conditions, including being evacuated and then sent to a Devon boarding school, she obtained only a sketchy primary education, but at the age of 10 she took and passed the 11-plus. On returning to the family\u2019s London home in Barnes she rarely saw her parents, who worked long hours and late shifts, but at grammar school she passed her School Certificate in English language, French, Latin, mathematics and general science. She failed at Latin, but I recall her catching up at evening classes during the period when we shared an office \u2013 and long musings on what colour exactly was meant by the phrase \u2018wine-dark sea\u2019.\nAnita left school aged 16 with a strong work ethic and a passionate desire for further education. For the first of a series of low-paid jobs she took advantage of a labour exchange scheme where London children went to work on farms, choosing to go to south Shropshire. Acquiring a shotgun and exploiting her ability to shoot rabbits allowed her to supplement her meagre pay. With post-war recession, she had to go back to London, where her mother paid for her to have driving lessons. Having already driven tractors and motorbikes she soon passed her test, and went to work for a garage in Notting Hill.\nIn 1956 Anita joined her father briefly in catering for the film crew and actors on Yangtse Incident, shooting in Essex. This was the beginning of a series of short-term catering jobs on film locations, one of which was feeding the crew making The Key, directed by Carol Reed and starring Trevor Howard. This production was shot at sea in the English Channel, which meant the cooks beneath the vessel\u2019s decks faced a challenging task during rough weather. Other work followed \u2013 three films set in the Scottish Highlands south of Oban, including I Know Where I\u2019m Going; then The Inn of the Sixth Happiness, with Ingrid Bergman (in a studio lot outside London). Six months filming in Ceylon for The Bridge on the River Kwai was a complicated opportunity to travel as far east as she ever went.\nAlongside driving jobs, Anita pursued a new interest in archaeology \u2013 two years of a four-year evening course were tough going, but changing to a job at the Science Museum in 1963 (entry-level qualifications being four O levels) allowed more time for study. The rest of the course was much easier, and she gained her diploma in archaeology from the University of London in 1967. Further foreign travel followed.\nThrough work she met Dennis McConnell, the ex-army son of a Scot, brought up in Uruguay. Both were interested in furthering themselves through education, so they saved money by moving in together, and marrying in 1963 to ease the burden of income tax. They continued to support each other\u2019s studies, but also managed cheap travel on the continent. Both became mature students, with grants: Dennis at LSE and Anita at UCL, where she picked physical geography as being relevant to her Science Museum work. The Museum gave her three years\u2019 unpaid study leave. Dennis finished his degree but without shining, and returned to lorry-driving. Anita got an upper second-class degree in August 1971, returned to the Science Museum and began a part-time MSc in the history of technology at Imperial College.\nAt work, her task was to move collections from London to York for the future National Railway Museum; after two more years at the Museum\u2019s stores at Hayes she returned to South Kensington to become Curator of Oceanography and Geophysics, charged with both extracting collections from deep storage and preparing an exhibition gallery. At this point she parted company with her husband in a difficult divorce. Plunging into work, she realised that the oceanographic work could form the basis of a thesis, enrolling at the University of Leicester under Dr Alex Keller. Publications followed, on both topics, including catalogues and general histories.\nI recall Anita firstly as a colleague, sharing the next-door office in the Post Office block, and arranging the photography of the barometers in the collection for the Shire booklet about them, then as a ferocious project coordinator for the Telecommunications gallery where the curators, Keith Geddes and Eryl Davies, referred to her as the \u2018Arse Biter\u2019. I later shared an office with her myself, doing similar work for the Exploration of Space exhibition, becoming \u2018Arse Biter Mark II\u2019. Eventually I became her assistant, and then her successor as Curator of Earth Sciences.\nAs can be seen from the list of her published books below, few carry the Science Museum (or HMSO) imprint. Research opportunities were hard-won, and by 1987 Anita\u2019s frustration at lack of support for the kind of work she preferred to do led her to go freelance, with one notable venture being a catalogue of the instruments belonging to the Ordnance Survey. Not all her ideas came to fruition, but one of the more successful was a trading business in historic barometers with Patrick Marney (a barometer specialist), which ran for 22 years. This resulted in papers and visits to places such as the Mariners\u2019 Museum in Virginia to produce a catalogue.\nAnita also worked on the history of Cooke, Troughton and Simms for Vickers Instruments and the University of York, and was commissioned by the late Gerry Martin to write a survey of the networks bringing knowledge of glassworking for optical uses to the London trade between 1500 and 1900. This was not published at the time, but is currently in press. She also worked at the Royal Institution, the National Museum of Scotland, the Mus\u00e9e Oc\u00e9anographique in Monaco, and the Whipple Museum of the History of Science at Cambridge, in a variety of capacities. She combined this with ten years of voluntary work as a magistrate for the City of London.\nIn 1993 Oxford University Press proposed a revision of the Dictionary of National Biography. One of the first blocks was business history, with a section for instrument- and clock-makers, and Anita was invited to become the Research Editor for that block. Her work involved finding suitable authors for updated and new entries, by default writing them herself. She went on to work on the blocks for science, medicine and art (engravers), as her research skills made her particularly useful in searching specialist London libraries. She provided more entries than any other single contributor, some 600 articles, before retiring in 2004.\nIn 2005, aged 69, Anita decided that living in London was too expensive, and moved to a converted farm labourer\u2019s cottage in a small village outside Stowmarket. Her new home had convenient rail access to London and to Cambridge, where she became an affiliated research scholar at the Department of the History and Philosophy of Science. Further travel took her to Brazil, Punta Arenas, Tahiti, Easter Island, Ethiopia, Syria, Mauritius, Uzbekistan, the Galapagos and elsewhere. She stayed in Monaco and Genoa with friends, and worked on seismological history with Graziano Ferrari and oceanographic history with Giorgio Dragoni, both based in Italy.\nHowever, after life in the country became more difficult, Anita eventually moved to Girton, north of Cambridge. Shorter trips abroad were made with friends, one of the last being to Dresden. This was to receive the Paul Bunge Prize on behalf of the Scientific Instrument Society, for the late Brian Gee\u2019s book Francis Watkins and the Dollond Telescope Patent Controversy, on which she was joint editor with Dr Alison Morrison-Low. The prize money went to the student fund of the society, supporting young academics in museum projects.\nAnita\u2019s published output was prodigious; some of the more important works are listed below, but readers of the Scientific Instrument Society Bulletin may know of the articles Alison Morrison-Low and I wrote with Anita describing our visits to collections and exhibitions during the 1990s and early 2000s. \u2018Travel broadens the mind,\u2019 our mentor told us: but it also made us think harder about the collections we cared for, their contexts nationally and internationally, and what should be added to them. She encouraged us to write and discuss historical problems. We will miss her and her critical mind.

It has not, so far, created a surge of scientific papers written by schoolchildren, but it remains a significant and compelling example of what might be possible if we adopt a more inclusive vision of science. The Blackawton bees project has strong resonances for our own AHRC Science in Culture project, \u2018Constructing scientific communities: citizen science in the 19th and 21st centuries\u2019, which is based at the Universities of Oxford and Leicester, in partnership with the London Natural History Museum, the Royal College of Surgeons and the Royal Society (www.conscicom.org).[2] The project explores, and contributes to, the growing movement of what has come to be known as \u2018citizen science\u2019, principally through the online Zooniverse platform (www.zooniverse.org), founded by co-investigator Chris Lintott, but also through historical research into the networks and communities who contributed to science in the 19th century, during a period when professional structures were only just emerging.\nCitizen science is a term that has entered into our vocabulary over the last 20 years, and has various uses in current practice: the report of the UK Environmental Observation Framework \u2018Understanding citizen science and environmental monitoring\u2019 (Roy et al., 2012) defines it simply as \u2018the involvement of volunteers in science\u2019. The term has recently been added to the OED lexicon, which frames it as \u2018scientific work undertaken by members of the general public, often in collaboration with or under the direction of professional scientists and scientific institutions\u2019. More specifically, it has also come to be used over the last ten years as a description of internet-based science projects which employ the time, energies and abilities of volunteers to analyse large data sets. There are connections here with \u2018crowd sourcing\u2019 techniques, but what distinguishes the work of the Citizen Science Alliance, and the Zooniverse platform with which we are working, is a desire to establish a distributed community of citizen scientists who work in collaboration with professionals, contributing to both the advancement of science and their own scientific education.\nAt its best, such work can produce spectacular results, as in the Dutch schoolteacher Hanny van Arkel\u2019s discovery of a new astronomical object, \u2018Hanny\u2019s Voorwerp\u2019 (see Figure 1), which has inspired a new area of scientific investigation, as well as a comic book devoted to her discovery (see Figure 2).\nThe story attracts because of its intriguing conjunction of seemingly unlikely elements: a young schoolteacher of English, with no interest in astronomy, reads a blog from Queen\u2019s guitarist, Brian May, about an online project on astronomy, Galaxy Zoo. She goes online, starts to classify galaxies, and eight days later her untrained eye notices an unusual coloured object in one of the pictures and she posts a query on the site\u2019s online forum. Interest in the object builds among the amateur online participants, until their questions are taken up by Chris Lintott and other astrophysicists, and further scientific investigation and analysis confirms that a new phenomenon has indeed been discovered.[3] The tale could belong to a Victorian manual of self-help, except this is not a story of heroic struggle against adversity. Nor does it fit the model of the lone, self-taught observer, who through dedicated and painstaking work is able to transform scientific understanding, as exemplified in the life of Jeremiah Horrocks, the lowly tutor (or minister) who realised that Kepler\u2019s calculations were wrong and was thus (in many accounts) the only person to witness the transit of Venus in 1639.[4] (see Figure 3) (In fact, Horrocks was part of a northern correspondence network of astronomers, and had exchanged calculations with William Crabtree, a Salford cloth merchant, who also witnessed the transit (see Figure 4). Lonely sweepings of the night sky are replaced in the modern version by evenings at the computer screen, and isolation by community, albeit in a virtual form. Without the engaged responses of fellow participants in Galaxy Zoo to her query, \u2018What\u2019s the blue stuff below? \u2013 Anyone?\u2019, it is probable Hanny van Arkel\u2019s interest would have waned, whilst the confirmation of the discovery is itself then made possible by the further engagement of the professional science community.\nAstronomy, with its disciplinary requirement for multiple and geographically dispersed observations, has a venerable history of popular engagement and observation. Thus the German astronomer Friedrich Argelander made \u2018An appeal to the friends of astronomy\u2019 in a German astronomical yearbook of 1844, calling on all amateur astronomers to send in their observations of variable stars.[5] Argelander entreats \u2018all lovers of the starry heavens\u2019 to help him in his task. They should not, he observes, be deterred by either the language of the paper or the apparent difficulty of the observations. He remains convinced \u2018that whoever carries on these observations for a few weeks, will find so much interest therein that he will never cease\u2019. His one request (Argelander, 1912, pp 207\u20138) is that \u2018the observations shall be made known each year. Observations buried in a desk are no observations. Should they be entrusted to me for reduction, or even for publication, I will undertake it with joy and thanks, and will answer all questions with care and with the greatest of pleasure.\u2019 His vision is of a distributed community of dedicated observers, probably self-taught, but all thoroughly enraptured by the task in hand, which is pursued for its own sake and for the love of contributing to the advance of knowledge. His own role will be both that of mentor and servant to the community. Rather appropriately, the appeal was later translated and republished in Popular Astronomy (Argelander, 1912) by Annie Jump Cannon, one of the \u2018human computers\u2019, or more pejoratively \u2018Pickering\u2019s women\u2019, assembled by Professor Edward Pickering at Harvard University in the 1880s and 1890s to help him classify stars.[6]\nEmployed specifically because they were cheap, and could thus enhance volume, these women were astonishingly effective, and none more so than Annie Jump Cannon, who during her career at the Harvard Observatory, from 1897 to 1941, classified 400,000 stellar bodies and discovered more than 300 variable stars. She also established the Harvard Classification System of stars which is still in use today. Whilst she received external recognition, becoming, for example, the first woman to receive an honorary doctorate from Oxford University in 1925, it was not until 1938, two years before her retirement, that she was given a full academic appointment at Harvard, as the William Cranch Bond Astronomer.[7] Her story is a reminder that calls for inclusivity do not in themselves dissolve hierarchies or professional boundaries.\nOur project aims to place contemporary citizen science in historical perspective, exploring the networks of participants engaged in science-related activities during the 19th century in a range of fields from natural history, with all the numerous field clubs and botanical exchange networks, through to meteorology and public health. The term \u2018citizen science\u2019 is obviously anachronistic when applied to the 19th century; indeed the research itself shows the problems of nomenclature when considering activities which do not fit into the binary amateur/professional which is so often retrospectively imposed on earlier periods. At a time when professional structures in science were just beginning to emerge, there were no clear divisions between amateur and professional, although there were nonetheless marked hierarchies, and intense rivalries, both individual and collective. For the same reasons, professional versus volunteer is also problematic, whilst the term \u2018lay\u2019 practitioner brings with it particular cultural baggage, which transforms the scientific profession into a form of priesthood (a view T H Huxley promoted none too subtly in his series of \u2018lay sermons\u2019 (1870)). This lacuna, and puzzling poverty in our language, forms in itself part of our subject of study as we track the shifting relations between different constituencies within the wider scientific community, broadly conceived.\nTwo potential terms for our 19th-century \u2018citizens\u2019 are those of expert or authority. Graeme Gooday (2008) has highlighted how the terms became tainted, in association with the rise of the distrusted \u2018expert witness\u2019 in the courtroom. Yet, when used for the volunteer community, they could become a strong endorsement of value and achievement. Thus George J Symons, who coordinated the observers for the British Rainfall survey, referred in the early stages to the named \u2018Authorities\u2019 who supplied the data (1862). Subsequently the dominant term used was \u2018Observers\u2019, but Symons also started referring to them as his staff, although only a handful received any payment, the term conferring a sense of an organised body who voluntarily gave their labour and achieved as much, if not more, than a paid professional body. As Katharine Anderson has noted in her excellent work Predicting the Weather: Victorians and the Science of Meteorology (Anderson, 2005), there was a marked contrast between the methods and orientation of James Glaisher, based at Greenwich, and with a network of 50 expert observers under his strict direction, and the British Rainfall observers, a body which grew from around 500 voluntary observers in 1860 to over 3400 by 1900, which was coordinated throughout this period by Symons (Anderson, 2005, pp 95\u2013105).\nThe British Rainfall Organisation provides a wonderful example of the growth of a network of devoted \u2018citizen scientists\u2019 in the 19th century. Symons had been working at the Meteorological Department at the Board of Trade when he published his first survey of British rainfall in 1860. By 1863 his network of observers had grown to over 700, and a four-page pamphlet to an annual publication of over 50 pages, and Symons left the Meterological Department in order to nurture this work. From 1866 he also published Symons\u2019s Monthly Meteorological Magazine, which he continued producing until his death in 1900. He encouraged his readers to think of themselves as contributing to the advance of science. His \u2018Introductory\u2019 to the fourth volume of the magazine in 1869 \u2018calls upon our readers to remember that the progress of any brand of science depends in part on the publications devoted to it \u2013 that if they are independent and progressive, the science is far more likely to advance, than if they are lethargic or dead\u2019 (p 1). The highly prized independence of his \u2018staff of correspondents\u2019 is seen as productive of progress, and compared implicitly to the moribund proceedings of established scientific societies. The burden of progress thus rests with the contributors. Symons concludes by reminding \u2018our readers that the progress of a scientific periodical very much depends on themselves; if they are prompt in supplying local information, and in pointing out any errors editorial or otherwise, it will tend to keep the whole staff up to their work\u2019. The whole is conceived as a shared enterprise, with accuracy guaranteed by the vigilance of readers and correspondents, who act both as contributing \u2018staff\u2019 and editors. Correspondents send in their observations which are then collated by Symons, but the magazine also contains considerable scientific debate: the heated discussions over whether \u2018a difference of the angle at which rain falls causes an alteration in the amount of rainfall upon a horizontal surface\u2019 (1871, p 133) extended over many months, with correspondents sending in lengthy letters, complete with diagrams and complex calculations, as they sought to resolve the scientific principles at stake.[8] What one sees here is a process of mutual scientific education: the practical requirements of observing rainfall produce initial scientific queries, which then lead engaged observers to the detailed development of their own theoretical explanations, drawing on the principles of physics. It offers an interesting example of a mode of exchange which is a form of precursor to the \u2018talk\u2019 forums offered on Zooniverse and other citizen science sites, where initial queries can lead the community into complex discussions, and often to further self-education in astronomy or other sciences.\nThe Monthly Meteorological Magazine ran alongside Symons\u2019s great labour of love, the annual rainfall survey, British Rainfall. Starting with monthly observations, the survey quickly moved to daily observations, at a precise hour, demanding a lot of the voluntary labour force. In his annual reports Symons both praises his \u2018staff\u2019 and exhorts them to do better: some send in late or illegible returns (1875, p 1); others fail to check their gauges during a major snowstorm (1885, p 1), whilst accuracy is an ongoing concern. Observers, he notes in 1884, must visit their gauges every day, \u2018instead of imagining whether there is anything in it or not\u2019 (p 8). In the early years Symons travelled constantly across the British Isles, meeting the observers and checking the accuracy of gauges, although he had to reduce these visits as the pressures of his work grew ever greater. In order to recruit his observers he had advertised in newspapers, a practice he would repeat through the decades. Thus in 1865 he wrote to every daily and weekly newspaper in the country (over 1400) to request \u2018on behalf of science, of my fellow-observers, and on my own behalf\u2019 for people to come forward, either with information on earlier rainfall records (since he was strongly aware of the need to establish historic data in order to trace shifting weather patterns) or current observers who were not yet in contact. He also calls for new observers to enlist, in order to ensure coverage across the country (p 8). In an earlier call in The Times he had noted that costs would be minimal, since observers could be sent gauges, and would receive the publication gratis, or at cost; \u2018neither is there any difficulty in observing, for my correspondents are of both sexes, all ages, and all classes\u2019 (1863, p 6). He proffers a wonderfully inclusive vision, although it is difficult to check how many women and children were involved, since their activities are often concealed behind the registration of the father or husband, but there is definitely a sprinkling of women entered in their own right in his published lists, and the legacy of a Miss Nunes in 1883 suggests a very engaged female participant (pp 14\u201318). Reflecting back over the first 25 years, Symons noted that many of the records that had been maintained continuously over this period had been passed from father to son, suggesting a family investment in the practice of observation (1884, p 14).\nIn his 1876 preface, Symons attempted to give his readers some sense of the magnitude of the labour involved in producing his annual report. It has required, he notes, \u2018the examination of more than a million figures\u2019; or, to place such a number in a more graspable form, \u2018before one figure was printed, upwards of 20,000 columns of figures have been checked, and ... every error detected in any one of them has been the subject of a communication to the person who made the mistake\u2019. In addition, he notes in his \u2018Report\u2019 of that year, the further levels of correspondence required with his network, from new stations, to altitude of benchmarks, advice on instruments and practice, and enquiries on all sorts of issues to do with water supply, health and drainage. He also received numerous difficult questions, \u2018a very favourite one being, \u201cPlease tell me whether it is true that less rain falls on the top of a house than on the ground? And if it really is so, why is it?\u201d\u2019 Such queries, he observes, cannot easily be answered with a brief note, but he answers them all: \u2018Although the labour of replying to these and similar questions falls chiefly upon myself, I do not regard it as by any means waste time, because all that tends to inform, correct, or assist the observers necessarily raises their qualifications, and therefore adds greatly to the value of their work and mine\u2019 (pp 6\u20137). Although his role could be seen as a somewhat patronising one, spreading education to the less well-informed masses, along the lines of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge earlier in the century, Symons\u2019s sense of the importance of the shared enterprise upon which he and his co-workers are embarked undercuts any such reading. He and the observers are bound together in a scientific undertaking that necessarily involves a process of mutual education and individual development.\nSymons fiercely maintained the independence of his network. When the Royal Society Meteorological Committee published a report claiming that \u2018they have been entrusted by Her Majesty\u2019s Government with the superintendence of the general system of British meteorology\u2019 he comments scathingly in the Monthly Meteorological Magazine (1871, p 125): \u2018We were not aware that this was the case, but if so, it is centralization with a vengeance, and we have yet to learn how far either the Meteorological Committee are able to superintend the general system of British meteorology, or what right Her Majesty\u2019s Government possesses over it.\u2019 His horror at such \u2018centralization with a vengeance\u2019 resurfaces in 1875 when the British Association for the Advancement of Science (BAAS) threatens to withdraw the small annual grant he received because he had insisted on remaining independent of the Meteorological Office. He notes in British Rainfall that he had flatly refused such a transfer of the system he had so painstakingly built up, adding (1875, p 8): \u2018I do not believe that the gentlemen who so kindly voluntarily discharge the duties of observers, would approve of being placed under the supervision of Government officials.\u2019 Whilst such a transfer might, he notes sarcastically, \u2018by the addition of red tape\u2019 make the system \u2018even more nearly perfect than it is\u2019 it would extinguish the \u2018esprit du corps\u2019 and \u2018would be at the cost of that intelligent independence of thought which so greatly rules the progress of science\u2019 (p 8). For Symons, that \u2018intelligent independence of thought\u2019 is crucial; scientific progress is made not by centralisation and control, but by stimulating each individual within a loosely affiliated network to think creatively.\nIn 1876 the South Kensington Museum held its Special Loan Collection of Scientific Instruments exhibition which was to lay the foundations for the current collections of the Science Museum. Symons ensured his network of observers and their instruments were well represented: he gave a popular address on rainfall measurement at one of the conferences (1876, p 7) and exhibited a range of rain gauges, including the \u2018Indestructible Monthly Rain Gauge for Private Observers\u2019.\nHe also exhibited engravings of apparatus employed in rainfall experiments; a diagram of fluctuations of rainfall in central England, from 1726 to 1869; and copies of British Rainfall, the Monthly Meteorological Magazine and his own popular work, Rain; How, When, Where, and Why it is Measured? (catalogue p 721).\nPerhaps most significantly, he exhibited a map showing the sites at which rainfall observations were being made, thus highlighting in visual form the reach and penetration of his network of observers. At the same time, he continued his campaign to preserve the independence of this network, printing in British Rainfall 1876 an account of the BAAS debate surrounding the cessation of its grant (of \u00a3100 a year), with his own impassioned speech of support. Symons highlights both the social and geographical diffusion of the network. The observers, he notes, \u2018belonged to all classes, from shepherds who took the gauges upon the mountains, and were paid by himself, to noblemen and gentlemen who bore some portion of the expense of the inquiry\u2019. The result was a system which was admired and imitated in other countries. The system now \u2018embraced some 2000 stations, so disseminated that it was scarcely possible to drop on any district in the British Isles which was more than four or five miles distant from a station\u2019 (p 8). For a voluntary network, the achievement is impressive, showing that Symons\u2019s newspaper advertising, and word-of-mouth recommendations, had enabled him to achieve optimal coverage not only within England, but across the British Isles. At the BAAS powerful voices were raised in support of his work, from Edwin Chadwick to Captain Douglas Galton, but the verdict in the end was that \u2018the time has now arrived when this work should be taken up in a larger public spirit, and consequently that the grant hitherto made should now cease\u2019 (1876, p 10). Residents of the current British Isles will recognise the rhetorical ploy, where praise of \u2018public spirit\u2019 is accompanied by a slashing of funds: Symons\u2019s own rhetoric is turned against him.\nAlthough pleas for financial support from the observers themselves became a constant refrain in British Rainfall from this point, Symons continued to grow the network, so that it stood at 3400 at the time of his death in 1900. He continued to maintain both the independence of the system and also his own idealism. In British Rainfall 1880 he reflects back on the growth of the network since its beginnings in 1860, and on the motivations of his participants. The passage is worth quoting in full:\n\u2018I am myself sometimes astonished at the magnitude of this amateur organization, without either State aid, magniloquent title, managing council or pecuniary resources except the voluntary contributions of the staff \u2013 a staff, whereof the members rarely see one another, and still more rarely see their chief, who reside in all parts of the country, from the Channel Islands in the South to the Shetlands in the far North, and from County Kerry in the South-West of Ireland to the Easternmost verge of England at Lowestoft; who include nearly every social grade from peer to peasant; and yet who (with exceptions so rare that they take me by surprise) work with a regularity and heartiness which is beyond praise. Why do they do it? Minor motives may have some influence, but I believe that the leading sentiment which binds together British Rainfall observers is the consciousness that they are helping gradually to store up a mass of information which is, and will yearly become increasingly, valuable to the nation at large \u2013 in relation alike to Agriculture, Sanitation, and the proper appropriation of the water supply of the British Isles.\u2019 (pp 6\u20137)\nThe passage picks up on many of his favourite themes: the voluntary, independent and egalitarian nature of the network; its geographical reach; and its social inclusivity, \u2018from peer to peasant\u2019. His speculation on motivations are entirely in keeping with recent research into participation by citizen scientists today: an online survey of 11,000 volunteers with Galaxy Zoo, the founding project for Zooniverse, found that over 40% listed their primary motivation as a desire to contribute to science (Raddick et al., 2015). Such findings cut through simplistic theories of the rational actor, motivated by self-interest, which still hold such sway in the realms of economic theory. Symons\u2019s question, \u2018Why do they do it?\u2019, resonates with us today, and lies in part behind the EPSRC project run by Dr Joe Cox, of Portsmouth Business School, on \u2018The Wonders of the Zooniverse: Modelling and Optimising Participation in Online Citizen Science\u2019.[9] As Raddick\u2019s research has shown, the desire to make a contribution, beyond any personal desire for self-improvement, education or recognition, stands out as the dominant motivating factor for the Galaxy Zoo participants. Symons, speculating on why his observers would for years brave the elements and record rainfall unfailingly every day, identifies a binding consciousness that their work is of use to the nation; that their individual recordings, perhaps of minor significance in themselves, when added together would form a powerful record, or what we would now term database, which could help address some of the most pressing issues of the time.\nRainfall was not just studied for its own sake in the 19th century, but, as Symons suggests, was a vital element in managing agricultural production, and systems of sanitation and water supply, made all the more pressing by the large-scale shift of the population from the countryside to densely packed towns. Although Symons would appear to have been wholly absorbed in his work with the rainfall observers, he was also exceptionally active in another network of \u2018citizens\u2019: the loose affiliation of individuals who formed sanitary organisations across the country, and who sent over a thousand representatives every year to the congresses of the Sanitary Institute. Symons was one of the key figures in this organisation, serving as registrar from 1880 to 1895, and overseeing the development of a national examination structure in sanitary science.[10] He also served repeatedly as president of the section on Meteorology, Geology and Geography. At his opening address to this section, at the meeting in Croydon in 1879, he anticipates the sceptics\u2019 questions: \u2018what is the use of making three days of it, and having a lot of dry scientific papers of no use to anybody, and incomprehensible by any but dreadfully scientific people?\u2019 (1880, p 173). He proceeds to demolish the errors in this question: \u2018the assumption that there is any difference or distinction between science and practice\u2019; and the belief that scientific papers are inaccessible to the ordinary reader. Once again his egalitarian instincts are to the fore: by dissolving the distinction between science and practice, he eliminates hierarchies; all who participate, at whatever level, are contributing to science. His own paper is also a model of accessibility, showing how meteorological concerns enter constantly into the practical aspects of daily life, from home ventilation to the construction height of buildings.\nSymons\u2019s abiding preoccupation with rainfall records, past and present, anticipates current climatological concerns, and his records form part of the data that are now proving invaluable for climate change research. In 1887 he received a grant of \u00a350 from the Royal Society in order to complete his collection of historical data up to 1800. Writing in British Rainfall he highlighted the crucial importance of this historical work: should a drought such as those experienced between 1738 and 1762 recur, \u2018not only will every town in England which receives its water supply from a gathering ground be put on short supply, but the canals will have to be closed and agricultural operations will have to be modified\u2019 (1887, p 9). Only with a detailed understanding of past weather patterns could such disruptions to daily life and livelihood be anticipated, and appropriate mitigatory measures set in place. Whilst the 18th-century records offered essential information for the management and planning of Victorian water supplies, the records so painstakingly built up by his observers would, he anticipates, prove crucial for the centuries to come. For the observers themselves, their work takes on a historical trajectory, contributing not only to the science of their time, but also to that of the future, and the wellbeing of generations not yet born.\nIn one of the current Zooniverse projects, \u2018Old Weather: Our Weather\u2019s Past, the Climate\u2019s Future\u2019, citizen scientists are extracting meteorological information from 19th-century ships\u2019 logs, in order to help climate scientists construct predictive models. They are, in a very direct sense, building on the work of their 19th-century predecessors. Symons\u2019s observers were focused on land observations, and on the British Isles (although Symons did also seek out as many observations as he could from British colonies), so this retrospective analysis, with its focus on weather at sea, offers an excellent complement to these earlier studies, whilst the quest for historical weather data also mirrors Symons\u2019s own searching out of historical recordings. The records from Symons\u2019s network of British rainfall observers form the foundation of the Meteorological Office\u2019s historical data, and are now contributing in no small measure to scientific research into patterns of climate change. They are also available free online,[11] giving the work of those dedicated 19th-century observers a longevity and significance which probably far surpasses even their most idealistic expectations.\nAlthough the standard narrative of scientific development is one of increasing specialisation and professionalisation, from the mid 19th century onwards, there are areas where the contribution of the non-professional has remained significant. This is particularly the case in studies of biodiversity, for example, where records of species, and knowledge of specific local areas, lie predominantly in the hands of volunteer members of organisations such as the Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland, which traces its origins back to 1836. Over the course of our project we will be exploring the rich history of these earlier forms of citizen science, and considering what lessons we can learn for contemporary scientific practice. In a recent article, Illingworth et al. (2014) describe their NERC-funded project to use citizen science to provide \u2018a feasible and low-cost solution to increasing the number of British rainfall-monitoring stations, with the potential coverage of these measurements extended to cover all areas of settlement across the British Isles\u2019 (p 203), working initially with primary schools. Their work has a distinguished lineage: Symons\u2019s \u2018Observers\u2019 are today\u2019s \u2018Citizens\u2019."},

We hold the term \u2018enthusiast expert\u2019 to define those who are committed to participating in the history of their community and advocacy for its heritage. Namely, (i) a commitment to the development of specialist historical knowledge to which they have dedicated their leisure time; (ii) a variety of practical rather than purely intellectual outcomes to their research practice; (iii) an active role as champions for the industrial and technical heritage, pursuing a range of roles from physical conservation, the management of volunteer-run collections, development of sector strategy, public engagement and lobbying.[5] Several of our group had connections to universities, but this wasn\u2019t essential, and academic scholars were not their primary audience.\nSecondly, we recognise that the term \u2018expert\u2019 is generally held to apply to someone with technical experience and social authority. There is a strong coincidence between the popular conception of \u2018expert\u2019 and the skill sets, social capital and dominant male gender of the EiS group.[6] We hold, however, that the nature of \u2018expertise\u2019 should be considered as extending beyond the domain of professionals in science and technology into diverse and more vernacular contexts (Srinivasan et al, 2010). The experience of the authors in working in heritage with groups of different genders, ages and levels of social capital, but similar commitments to their community\u2019s heritage, suggests that the term \u2018enthusiast expert\u2019 carries well beyond the demographic profile of the group in EiS.\nThirdly, we are attentive to the politics that separate the \u2018enthusiast\u2019 from the \u2018professional\u2019. The working group participants which, as noted above, included curators, other museum staff and enthusiast experts were equal partners in the knowledge exchange process. We think this can be usefully conceptualised as a \u2018continuum of practice\u2019 (see Craggs et al, 2013), where each participant through their differing motivations, logics and activities contributes to the ecology of heritage and, in particular, how energy heritage can be \u2018understood, experienced and reshaped\u2019 (ibid, p 881). This article draws attention to this dynamic, arguing that it is productive because \u2018it draws attention to the overlaps between seemingly diverse roles and identities\u2019 (ibid, p 893).\nWe understand museums to be heterogenous organisations and this article focuses on one national museum context in particular. However, we recognise that in smaller, often volunteer-led museums, enthusiast experts such as those involved in EiS could easily be responsible for managing and running such organisations (see Candlin, 2016). Likewise, the SMG curators may have their own personal enthusiasms which may differ from (or are aligned with) their professional role (see Geoghegan, 2008, p 174). Enthusiast experts should therefore be seen as part of a continuum, their expertise, in this case for energy heritage, sits alongside that of a number of diverse actors whose positions on the continuum can shift and change depending on the context.\nWith this understanding of a continuum in mind our use of the term \u2018enthusiast\u2019 is not intended to reinforce a professional vs. amateur divide, but it allows us to recognise that some institutional practices may do so. The professionalisation of the heritage sector has created obvious disruptions to a smooth \u2018continuum\u2019 of expertise for some museums, particularly in large organisations such as SMG. For members of the EiS group this could feel jolting when camaraderie was cut short by institutional regulations that clearly demarcate forms of access, regulating and excluding enthusiast \u2018outsiders\u2019 (Meyer, 2008).\nWhilst roles and practices in smaller and independent heritage organisations might be more fluid (see Candlin, 2016) national museums face a particular challenge in building productive and sustainable relationships between stored collections and enthusiast experts. This is due, in part, to the scale of these organisations. The division of labour in large museums means that stored objects bear increasingly multiple relationships even internally. Stored collections are mediated by different departments with different forms of accountability and different agendas (curators, conservators, learning teams and PR, for example) (Morse, 2018). These departments sometimes have conflicting processes and narratives. Additionally, the communities of enthusiast experts may be spread thinly over a national geography. Our attempts within EiS to map some institutional processes (see Figure 1) indicated just how hard it is to create and maintain the sociability and \u2018liveliness\u2019 of relationships under these conditions.\nYet despite potential barriers, in acting across and beyond institutional boundaries, enthusiast experts can be seen to be vital to the dynamism of the sector, or (as we have chosen to conceptualise it) the ecology of heritage. An earlier small-scale collaborative research project Who Cares, Interventions in \u2018unloved\u2019 museum collections had shown that there is a need to better understand how museums can meet the needs of enthusiast experts as a group which, arguably, has received little attention in recent years (see Woodham et al, forthcoming). EiS set out to redress this by putting the relationship(s) between stored collections, museum infrastructure and enthusiast experts centre-stage."},

Boyer\u2019s words elegantly summarise the ways in which discussions on healthcare touch upon issues of race, class and gender politics.The Undying is an account of Boyer\u2019s treatment for cancer and its frank and lyrical tone invokes another great American writer\u2019s take on the psychological and social effects of illness. Susan Sontag\u2019s Illness as Metaphor (1978) reflects on Sontag\u2019s cancer diagnosis, famously opening with the lines:\nEveryone who is born holds dual citizenship, in the kingdom of the well and in the kingdom of the sick. Although we all prefer to use only the good passport, sooner or later each of us is obliged, at least for a spell, to identify ourselves as citizens of that other place (Sontag, 1978).\nThis essay addresses the curating of Misbehaving Bodies: Jo Spence and Oreet Ashery, an exhibition at Wellcome Collection from May 2019 to January 2020. The show brought together the work of Jo Spence (1934\u20131992) and Oreet Ashery (1966\u2013), two artists from different generations who explore the representation of illness and experiences of care.It explores the challenges of producing an exhibition on the subject of illness and presenting conflicting patient testimonies. It goes on to interrogate the curatorial strategies that were deployed to provide a comfortable space for difficult material, and give voice to people with lived experience, healthcare providers and carers, academics and artists. Boyer and Sontag\u2019s words frame many of the key issues that the exhibition addressed and form a roadmap to help navigate my reflections in this essay.\nCentral to Ashery and Spence\u2019s work, and core to the exhibition, were a series of questions: How does illness disrupt and shape the way we think about the body, family and identity? What does healthy mean? As people are living longer, often with chronic illnesses, how do we live with uncertainty? What does it mean to live well with chronic conditions and illness? While racial, class and gendered discourses touch us all in different ways, the experiences of illness and death are \u2013 as Sontag reminds us \u2013 inevitable. Sickness is a universal subject and healthcare is a nexus in which many political and social issues intersect. In a roundtable conversation published in the exhibition guidebook, Oreet Ashery states:\nDeath is an exaggerated form of life, so that if you are poor and you become ill you will become poorer. If you are a person who is queer, it can be difficult for people to come and visit you in hospital. The economy of marginality people experience over their lives becomes highlighted in death (Vasey, 2019).\nAlongside Boyer and Sontag, Ashery touches upon something crucial in the curatorial aims of Misbehaving Bodies. While illness is a universal human experience, pain and suffering are not always equally distributed. I write this essay during lockdown in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic and these issues feel more urgent. While this is not an essay about Covid-19, Ashery\u2019s words feel prescient. The latest data from the Office for National Statistics indicates that communities in poorer and BAME communities have been drastically more impacted by the virus (England and Wales methodology, 2020). It should come as no surprise that people who are often subject to systems of exclusion typically bear the brunt of the precarity and pain that comes with illness.Conversations around healthcare have become amplified since the exhibition closed. One of the aims of the exhibition was to complicate the binary between health and sickness and to think of these terms as a sliding scale, rather than absolute.[1] These distinctions have further collapsed in the face of the pandemic, and in the words of the co-curator of the exhibition B\u00e1rbara Rodr\u00edguez Mu\u00f1oz, \u2018we are all potentially healthy and sick, carers and patients, infectious and vulnerable and overall we are all entangled\u2019. The pandemic has made \u2018an abstract reality become very tangible\u2019 (Vasey, 2020).\nThe title of the exhibition, Misbehaving Bodies, articulates many of the things we were hoping to achieve with the show. The etymology of the prefix \u2018mis\u2019 suggests that something has gone astray \u2013 that it deviates from the \u2018normal\u2019. The current urge to return to normality in the face of the pandemic and the ubiquity of the term \u2018the new normal\u2019 erases the voices of immunosuppressed people for which the \u2018normal\u2019[2] was often a space of exclusion and inaccessibility. We can look to projects such as the open call disability arts manifesto Not Going Back to Normal (2020),[3] as part of the advocacy work in challenging these assumptions. \u2018Misbehaviour\u2019 is something a parent would say to a child, and it captures the sense of infantilisation that many patients recognise when negotiating healthcare environments. Through this essay I will articulate the ways in which Spence and Ashery respond to feelings of disempowerment and how, through the curation of the exhibition, myself and Rodr\u00edguez Mu\u00f1oz expanded on the logic of the artists\u2019 intentions and instituted Wellcome Collection\u2019s interdisciplinary approach to exploring and challenging how both individuals and society think and feel about health. The institutional impetus for the exhibition emerged after the Wellcome Collection acquired six Jo Spence photographs in 2015 for their Art and Healthcare collection. According to Rodr\u00edguez Mu\u00f1oz, Spence\u2019s raw, confrontational works chimed with \u2018a growing appetite for more honest, unheroic, embodied narrations of illness and overall experiences of vulnerability that challenge glossier representations of perfect, productive, healthy bodies\u2019 (Vasey, 2020). Getting sick and the process of dying is \u2013 unsurprisingly \u2013 not a conversation people want to readily engage in but as an institution dedicated to exploring healthcare it feels crucial to be able to host this difficult conversation. This increased appetite for narratives that challenge traditional concepts of illness and sickness is evidenced through exhibitions exploring healthcare and the political conditions of sickness and disability internationally. Examples include Nora Heidorn\u2019s group exhibition Sick and Desiring, held at Bergen Assembly in 2019, which aimed to politicise sickness and \u2018organise around shared vulnerabilities and operate against a culture which fetishises notions of health and wellness that are in the service of ever-increasing productivity\u2019 (Heidorn, 2019).[4] The project brought together the artists Sarah Browne, Julia Bonn and Inga Zimprich among others, who \u2018nurtured practices of self- and collective care\u2019. The programme encompassed an exhibition, screenings and workshops, drawing on the history of collectivist and activist action to question the pharmaceutical industries and advocate for alternative treatments. Similarly, terms such as vulnerability, healing, resilience, collectivity and self-care have become prevalent among institutional press releases recently[5] in what can be perceived as a healthcare turn in cultural discourse. While disability arts has a long and storied history, it has historically been ghettoised in the UK and supported by organisations dedicated to these particular practices, including SHAPE, Disability Arts Online, The Sick of the Fringe and DASH. These previously marginalised conversations and practices have \u2014 to some extent \u2014 started to gain greater visibility. Artists such as Carloyn Lazard, Leah Clements, Johanna Hevda and Simone Leigh have garnered institutional attention for work addressing sickness. Mari Katayama and Jesse Darling explore the politics and representation of disability and were both included in Ralph Rugoff\u2019s exhibition May You Live in Interesting Times for the Venice Biennial in 2019, placing these narratives at the centre of art world attention.Alongside this mainstreaming, there has also been a resurgent interest in the HIV/Aids activist work of David Wojnarowicz, Gran Fury and ACT UP,[6] who have received much increased attention on both sides of the Atlantic. The AIDS epidemic, in particular, showed us the ways in which activists and artists politicise sickness to challenge normative notions of healthy bodies. It is no coincidence that this resurgence has corresponded with an austerity drive across Europe and America that has eroded care capacities and public infrastructure. In a recent report by the Social Metric Commission in the UK (Measuring Poverty, 2020) they concluded that four million of those in poverty in the UK are disabled. As mentioned earlier, the retraction of welfare support continues to disproportionately affect the most vulnerable. There has been a similar appetite in publishing with new books on the topic of disability and pathography from Robert McRuer, Anne Boyer, Frances Ryan and Dodie Bellamy reaching broader audiences beyond academia. In film-making, Crip Camp[7] (2020), which explores the civil rights histories of disability, has been met with commercial and critical success.\u00a0Misbehaving Bodies happened amid this groundswell of activity that perhaps made audiences more receptive to its concerns.\nSpence\u2019s work has received acclaim since the 1980s for its radical reassessment of representation and healthcare. During her life she worked across community, education, healthcare and gallery contexts.[8] Because of this itinerant practice, her archive is dispersed and fragmentary, largely split between the Ryerson University and Richard Saltoun Gallery, London.[9] Birkbeck, University of London host the open access Jo Spence Memorial Library, run by Professor Patrizia Di Bello, containing archival material and Spence\u2019s extensive library of books on healthcare. Posthumously, Spence has had retrospectives at MACBA, Barcelona in 2005 and been included in documenta 12 in 2007, and since her retrospective at Studio Voltaire and SPACE, London in 2012 her work has gained traction, increasingly supported and acquired by institutions such as Tate and Wellcome Collection.\nAshery\u2019s trans-disciplinary work has traversed performance, installation and moving image. Since the late 1980s her work has explored community and mutual care, through the lens of class, gender and sexuality. Her work has gained traction internationally over the last ten years with major commissions for Artangel in 2010 and 2013, and inclusion in Rennes Biennial in 2018 and 6th Thessaloniki Biennale of Contemporary Art in 2017. Ashery was awarded the Jarman Award in 2017 for Revisiting Genesis and Turner Prize Bursary in 2020 for her work on Misbehaving Bodies. She is currently an Associate Professor of Fine Art at Ruskin School of Fine Art.\u00a0"},

With vehicles that could now go faster and further afield, the bicycle became part of modern life in a way that transcended its merely functional use as means of transport. First with cycle racing, and by the close of the 1870s with cycle touring too, the bicycle developed a new distinctive cultural significance. A key reason for this, as we will see, was that it offered new ways of adapting the physical self to the modern world by extending the capabilities of the human body, and thus its perception of and engagement with space. By the mid-1870s the high-wheeler (also known as the \u2018ordinary\u2019 or penny-farthing) had become the standard bicycle in Britain regardless of the fact that it was dangerous to ride. The main reason for its popularity was that it was fast, much faster than its predecessor, the velocipede. The high-wheeler was particularly favoured by athletes, and cycle racing quickly became a popular public spectacle.\nFigures 1 and 2 show two cycle races from the early 1880s, giving a sense of the crowd that gathered to watch these events.[11] These competitions put the human body on show but also on trial, showing how the body could be pushed, and thus celebrating its achievements. This was a time when body-machine interactions were central in the public debate, with opinions differing on the nature of technological advancements. As Foster for example recognises, \u2018the human body and the industrial machine were still seen as alien to one another\u2026the machine could only be a \u201cmagnificent\u201d extension of the body or a \u201ctroubled\u201d constriction of it\u2019 (2004, p 109): in the case of cycling, it was generally considered to be the former. What is celebrated for instance in photographs such as Figures 3 and 4 is a specifically modern aesthetic of the athlete\u2019s body enhanced and put on display thanks to its engagement with the new technology.\nCycling also allowed people to transform their physical self in another, more widely accessible, context: that of touring. The success of cycle racing energised the British cycle trade, which by the end of the 1870s was flourishing, and it also fostered the demand for cycles that the wider public could use in their leisure time. The high-wheeler was dangerous to ride, so manufacturers started developing three- and four-wheeled machines (tricycles and quadricycles) easier and safer to use and that allowed for the carrying of luggage too. Figure 5, for example, shows a popular model amongst photographers, the Rotary Tricycle produced by the Coventry Machinists\u2019 Company, with a bellow camera mounted on it.[12] Figure 6 shows two other tricycles next to a photographer and the glass plate cameras that, we can assume, would have been carried on these tricycles.\nSimultaneously, the appeal of independent travel was also fostered and supported by organisations such as the CTC, which proved extremely successful: from eighty members in 1878, the membership had reached almost 11,000 in 1883, over 20,000 in 1885, and peaked at more than 60,000 by the close of the century. Together with the gazette, handbooks (which, starting in 1887, also detailed facilities providing a darkroom)[13] and guides produced by the CTC, cyclists had at their disposal a number of other tools that encouraged them to travel \u2018far from the beaten track\u2019 (George, 1885, p 344): OS maps, travel guides, cyclometers, lamps, not to mention the sharing of personal experiences and recommendations that took place within the pages of the photography and cycling press and, as Brennan\u2019s letter indicates, within photography and cycling clubs. Indeed, at this time many cycling clubs opened a photographic section, as camera clubs did a cycling one.[14] Additionally, at the end of the 1870s dry plates started to be mass-produced (Pritchard, 2010). It was now no longer necessary to attend to the glass-plates immediately before and after exposure, as was the case with the wet collodion process. This made the taking of photographs outdoors much more practical. As a result of these changes, cycle and camera makers began promoting their products to photographers and cyclists respectively \u2013 for example, in 1879 the magazine Cycling reviewed the Scenograph camera (1879a), while the Coventry Machinists\u2019 Company advertised on the front cover of the first issue of the AP in 1884. These advertisements, together with editorials, letters and articles praising the combination of camera and cycle appeared with increasing frequency in both the photography and cycling press. By the close of the century contemporary commentators agreed, as the AP for example declared, that \u2018the cycle and camera are indissolubly wedded to one another\u2019 (1899, p 1).As I argue in the following section, by embracing the new technology of physical mobility amateur photographers found themselves in the position to negotiate \u2013 or, at least, that was the promise \u2013 the experience and temporality of late nineteenth-century modernity. This led to the emergence of a desire to use photography in consonance with their new spatio-temporal experiences."},

They were young men, even teenagers, based in industrial parts of Britain, notably Leeds, Liverpool and the Midlands. Galvanised by the imported American pulps, they gathered together to discuss science fiction, and to publish their thoughts upon it and sundry related matters. These young men, moderately educated, and from a variety of class backgrounds, created eddies in the historical mainstream of twentieth-century scientific media. Their magazines (\u2018fanmags\u2019) were produced domestically or on the sly at work; with their hand-cranked duplicators they attempted to participate in the overlapping worlds of science and the published word. There is, alas, no evidence of Large ever having engaged on a personal level with the science fiction fans; he did not, so far as anyone knows, attend the earliest science fiction conventions of the late 1930s. However, his name was noted amongst the fans. His first novel in particular (Sugar in the Air, 1937) was known by them for its excellence. Douglas F Mayer\u2019s editorial in Tomorrow (1937, p 3) gave thanks for 1937 as an annus mirabilis of science fiction, with Large\u2019s novel, alongside H G Wells\u2019 Star Begotten and Olaf Stapledon\u2019s Star Maker \u2018a gift from the gods\u2019. Sugar in the Air was, apparently, the nation\u2019s second-best seller for one week, just behind Wells (Hanson, 1937, p 13). Serious-minded readers connected Sugar in the Air, a cautionary tale treating the brutal triumph of commerce over the idealism of the scientist, with real-world attempts by Ritchie Calder and others to integrate science into the solution of social problems (Anon, 1938, p 12). Large\u2019s success with the fans was due in large part to his interleaving of the real world and fiction, of science and text, in a way that spoke powerfully to their ambitions. For the fans, participation in science was conducted through the written word. Frederik Pohl (2013) has captured the fannish will to publish in his recollections:\nMy\u2026friend\u2026and I had long before decided that that year [1938], or one nearby, would be the time when both he and I cast off our fannish plumage and revealed ourselves as SF pros assoluto [sic]. \u2018Writer\u2019 had a lilting beauty as descriptor of our futures. \u2018Editor\u2019 conveyed\u2026a certain majesty. \u2018Publisher\u2019 was more majestic still\u2026 (Pohl, 2013, p 4).\nFans were able to play at all these roles in the production of their home-made magazines (Sleigh, 2016), and indeed discussion of their publishing activities often came to dominate in those magazines over and above their notional subject matter, science fiction. Large\u2019s writing life gave the fans, perhaps, grounds for hope, since Sugar in the Air drew on his life as a bona fide research chemist. The fan Denny Jacques attempted something similar, using his knowledge of organic chemistry to create his earnest three-part series \u2018Coal-Tar Cosmos\u2019 for readers of the fanmag Novae Terrae.[2]Made redundant by the failure of the chemical factory at which he worked (Large, 1973, p 2), and wishing to try his luck at professional writing, Large created a fictional double, C R Pry, a scientist who wishes to be a writer. Sugar in the Air relates, as a corollary to Pry\u2019s/Large\u2019s failure as a scientist, the means by which he succeeds as a writer. The follow-up was even more complex in its authoriality (on authoriality see Sleigh, 2010). As Stuart Bailey puts it, Asleep in the Afternoon (Large, 1938a) is a \u2018meta-sequel\u2019 that picks up where the first novel left off; it \u2018proceeds to continue, duplicate and mirror it all at once\u2019 (Bailey, 2008, p 87). It follows Pry\u2019s subsequent efforts to write a novel, Asleep in the Afternoon, whose substance is the substance of Large\u2019s own novel, Asleep in the Afternoon. Large\u2019s first two novels thus formed their own reality in just the way the fans, albeit with less finesse, dreamed of doing: \u2018abstract form of text-as-thought and physical form of book-as-object\u2019 (Bailey, 2008, p 87). Towards the end of his life, Large had recomposed his autobiography as being the path of a novelist trying his luck with science: to \u2018show the high and mighty Professors of Plant Pathology that I, an insignificant novelist, could\u2026tell the whole history of plant pathology a great deal better than could they themselves\u2019 (pp 78\u20139). As Robin Kinross observes, in Large\u2019s writing \u2018we feel the writer is watching himself write\u2019 (Bailey and Kinross, 2008, p 10).[3] This is a perfect description of the fans\u2019 writing also, albeit in less skilful form. Denny Jacques concluded his first essay on the \u2018Coal-Tar Cosmos\u2019 with his own reflections on organic chemistry as a source of sweetness: \u2018Another interesting product is saccharin... It is termed the \u201csweetest thing on earth\u201d (cf. the beautiful girl in many science fiction stories).\u2019 With sophomoric clumsiness, he concluded: \u2018On this note of levity the present article must end\u2019 (Jacques, 1936, p 6). As for Large\u2019s writing, so for his reading: the world and the text were interleaved. Large described his own mode of reading (no doubt mischievously) as one of ignoring the argument, but rather an exercise in trying to reconstruct the author as a character in his mind (Large, 1938b). With such complexities afoot, it is no surprise that in Large\u2019s novels fans found a particularly talented creation of the science/text hall of mirrors that they commonly inhabited (Sleigh, 2016).As Peter Bowler has shown (2009), the world of science fiction overlapped considerably with that of wireless enthusiasm (see Figure 1). Arthur C Clarke (1996), photographed as a child with his home-made set, is a particularly well-known example. Leonard Kippin, co-founder of the first fan club, was a radio buff, and Douglas Mayer\u2019s precociously-named Institute of Scientific Research in Leeds incorporated two pre-existing radio clubs. There was, moreover, an overlap between magazines treating radio-related topics and those dealing in both non-fictional futurism and scientifiction. The publisher Hugo Gernsback was in one way or another involved with a dozen separate radio magazines, along with other science and mechanics titles. Archibald Low, a contributor to science fiction fanmags and first president of the British Science Fiction Association, was emblematic of the crossover in Britain. His own publications catered to young, often male, science fans, while his industrial research covered topics in sound and wireless communication and control. Home-made sets were on the decline by the 1930s, but the lure of the crystal still drew a good number of children \u2013 mostly boys \u2013 into the world of science and communication. (Wireless World ran occasional features on the construction of crystal sets into the 1930s.) Had Dawn in Andromeda been written at the same time as Large\u2019s first two novels, that is, the late 1930s, his selection of the wireless set as acme of scientific civilisation would have been a fond, witty and plausible choice for his fans.\nMore specifically than this, the superhet was an appropriate choice too. Amongst fans and consumers, the superheterodyne, or superhet, wireless receiver set had come to dominate by the 1930s. As radio stations increased in number, crowding the bandwidth, the superhet provided one way to tune in accurately to a station occupying a small part of the spectrum. It did so by imposing an intermediate frequency (IF) upon the carrier signal (RF), thus creating an emergent, third wave, whose amplitude modulations could be translated by the receiver into sound. Historian Keith Geddes puts it beautifully: \u2018In effect, the waveband is shifted across the receiver, rather than vice versa\u2019 (1991, p 103). The story is of course more complicated; as Bussey describes (1990, pp 18\u201319), the first superhets (see Figure 2) actually caused problems in precisely the technical aspects that retrospective histories claimed they solved. However, in the 1930s a second generation of superhet became the standard basis of pre-assembled wireless sets, enabling selective and accurate tuning in a crowded spectrum.\nFor readers of Wireless World, ease of tuning to multiple stations via the superhet was a big draw. The journal published monthly lists of the frequencies of European stations, and there was frequent discussion of what could be heard on them. The \u2018all-wave\u2019 aspect of a set referred to its ability to pick up short wave signals in addition to the medium waves that conducted signals from Europe. Again, Wireless World obliged with the list of stations \u2013 on this frequency, worldwide \u2013 that could be found across the dial. The magazine explained the doubling of membership in the Radio Society of Great Britain between 1931 and 1937 as being due, largely, to an increasing interest in short wave reception (5 February 1937, p 124). For a period, all-wave wireless seemed to be opening up the world.Wireless, like writing and publishing, was a way to participate in science. For one thing, readers of Wireless World were quick to write in with their opinions about policy, regulation and planning of wireless transmission. Judging by the letters pages, its regular columnists did a good job of voicing many of the hopes and frustrations of readers, too. Moreover, wireless technology provided a forum in which enthusiasts could experiment on principles that blurred the boundary between technical and fundamental:\nIn well-equipped laboratories experimenting is dignified with the title of RESEARCH (with a capital \u2018R\u2019); in the home it is generally called \u2018tinkering about in the workshop\u2019. Sooner or later we all come to it. The home-constructor of The Wireless World sets tries a valve or component different from that given in the published design\u2026and at the moment that a written note or record of a result is made, such \u2018tinkering\u2019 is entitled to the status of Experimenting, no less than the work in the research laboratories\u2026 (Wireless World, 4 June 1937, p 542).\nIn the fan magazines, tinkering was generally restricted to theoretical calculations about space travel; in wireless, it could be done for real. It is exactly this kind of tinkering that Large uses to reconstruct the history of science in Dawn in Andromeda. Discoveries are entirely practical, and the emphasis is always on the materiality and sheer hard graft of the process. The methods by which the group tries to make are an early example in the book, described with careful detail (pp 21\u201333). Large had made his family try them out too, tinkering for themselves so that he could write about them with real know-how (Large\u2019s daughter: personal communication). Here, Large\u2019s characters calculate how to obtain sufficient friction to make fire:\n\u2018The mechanical equivalent of heat, on earth,\u2019 said Plan Raym, \u2018used to be 778 foot-pounds per British Thermal Unit [\u2026] That means the amount of work I\u2019d have to do to haul\u2026you up to the top of these cliffs\u2026would be just about enough to raise one ounce of wood to 700 degrees Fahrenheit, at which temperature it might ignite\u2019 (p 21).\nPlan is forced to concede that the absence of something as simple as rope makes this impossible. Eventually, the colonists construct an ingenious \u2018fire-making machine\u2019, \u2018primitive\u2019 but also \u2018very powerful\u2019, described in impressive and convincing detail. In the end, however, the machine counts for nothing; it is the sheer doggedness of the blacksmith, Sars, using a simple stick in his hands, that wins out:\nIt wasn\u2019t the special stick that made the fire. And it wasn\u2019t science. Science would only come lumbering along afterwards, explaining things. It was faith that made the fire. It was Sars\u2019 dumb faith in himself. It had never once occurred to Sars that he, a blacksmith, could not make a fire. So he had kept on, just that little bit longer, after any of the others would have tired (p 33).\nThe description of science \u2018lumbering along afterwards\u2019 is shortly proved correct, with Sord, the party\u2019s scientist, explaining \u2013 almost explaining away \u2013 the achievement of the bloody-palmed Sars by reference to the special properties of the wood that he used (p 33). Large\u2019s mission, to recreate the history of science through the hard work of the hand and the tinkering mind-set of the engineer, extends through the refinement of iron, the search for rare earth metals, and many more feats in the novel. In respect of its scale it recalls Wells\u2019 various excursions into the \u2018outline\u2019 of history, except that Large\u2019s account is by no means as positivist as Wells\u2019. \u2018History is no exception amongst the sciences\u2026the clustering multitude of details dissolves into general laws\u2019, writes Wells (1921, p vi), but nothing could be further from Large\u2019s vision. Large\u2019s reader must be impressed not by general laws but by a realisation of the sheer materiality that enables the transmission and reception of radio waves: the metals, the vacuums, the glassware \u2013 not to mention such basics as measurement of time and space.[4] The wireless circuit diagram, scratched out in early days \u2018before they forgot\u2019 (p 83), is really the least of it. A discussion between the men of the party examines the theme. Scientist Sord remarks: \u2018Do you realize that if we were to forget to write down the binomial theorem it would be lost for ever?\u2019 (p 90; ibid for remainder of paragraph). The remark smacks of hubris, and is faintly ridiculous, uttered as it is beside a campfire and the remains of a roasted pig. Gun, the doctor, proposes an alternative method: \u2018\u2026don\u2019t bother about that [i.e. writing it down]. It\u2019s much easier to do it biologically.\u2019 Prompted to explain, he advances the notion of continuing what they have begun: \u2018begetting a lot of children as quickly as possible, and leaving it for them to pick up and carry forward.\u2019 In other words, it is a question of training up the next generation. Verbs \u2013 actions \u2013 predominate: beget, leave, pick, carry. His euphemised pity for the next generation \u2013 \u2018poor little baskets\u2019 \u2013 repeats the theme; the emphasis is not on the abstracted knowledge that must be carried, but on the physical acts of carrying \u2013 the \u2018doing\u2019 approach of the engineer. In this scene, the conversation then turns to the wireless as exemplar. Sord asks the doctor whether he ever made a wireless set in his previous life on Earth, indicating that he himself did: \u2018It was pretty interesting: the making and the theory of it\u2019 (p 90; ibid for remainder of paragraph). Somewhat to Sord\u2019s surprise, Gun says that he did too, even bettering him by having constructed \u2018a sort of time-base for a television tube\u2019 (as mid-1930s readers of Wireless World might have done). The wireless is the shared point of origin for their subsequent development: the one as a scientist, the other as a doctor. But Gun puts the wireless firmly in its place as a juvenile activity; his enthusiasm came \u2018just after the stage when I wanted to be an engine-driver\u2019.[5] Finding \u2018there was nothing much in it \u2013 just some valves and a few tuned circuits\u2019, his attentions turned to biology. Indicating the gnats dancing around the fire, Gun comments: \u2018On one sip of plant-sap it can buzz for hours. You make me an engine like that, and I\u2019ll begin to admire your science\u2026.\u2019 Here again is a sort of theory \u2013 almost Spencerian \u2013 about the internalisation and carriage of knowledge in humans qua biological agents.\nNotwithstanding this final step from wireless to biology, a clear picture of science emerges in Dawn in Andromeda. It is the kind of science that fans of the 1930s endorsed: practical, tinkering, collaborative, entrepreneurial. It was the science of the wireless: one science in which fans and amateurs could plausibly participate."},

It is therefore not surprising that this optical device was highly adaptable and found a place within diverse institutional and performative practices, as well as other media, and has a pervasive presence across countless cultural locations, from the fairground to the schoolroom or church hall (Vogl-Bienek and Crangle, 2016; Eifler, 2017). An apt example of this dynamic is in the RSM, founded in 1907 as a central hub in London for promoting and diffusing the scientific aspects of medicine.\nUpheld by the modernisation of its aims and members, the RSM sought to bring together all branches of medicine and encouraged collaboration across disciplines. Thus, 15 separate medical societies in Britain were amalgamated into one compact and influential body, dissolving and transferring their assets and property, and reconstituted into 13 sections to unite the profession (1910, pp 657\u201358). To be seen as a place of authority within the medical community, cooperation of sections needed to be debated, which necessarily occurred inside the confines of the society and its publication. This intersection and interaction between disciplines helped to eliminate specialisation and subdivision between the departments of knowledge (1911, p 1485).\nFrom 1914, the society\u2019s lecture and meeting rooms, at its premises at No. 1 Wimpole Street, were at the disposal of Medical Officers of the Services. Society members found themselves no longer able to avoid \u2018the thorny subject of medical politics\u2019 (1918a, p 13). In spite of its hazards and expense, the lantern rapidly gained a footing as part of routine teaching practice within the society.[5] While this fact alone may seem inconsequential, the placement of the lantern at the heart of research debate is not. Weekly evening meetings were crucial so that groups of civilian-surgeons working in face and jaw injury departments for the Army Medical Services could gather at Wimpole Street to perform efficient lantern projections, interact and discuss their experiences, and use sets of slides to present and teach the outcomes of experimental surgeries. Surgeons therefore relied on the importance of physical meetings to explicate new findings of scientific merit and validate their evidence. These weekly dialogues were then extended to the Proceedings by inclusion of speakers\u2019 papers and a selection of the slides.\nThe images in Figures 2 and 3 show lecture lanterns for both scientific use and amateur home entertainment from the early 1900s, giving a sense of the projectors on the market at the time.\nBy 1914, electricity was the most commonly used source of power for lantern projections and had replaced older, less reliable and highly flammable means of illumination, such as limelight, oils and compressed gases. In an early history of the electric light for the lantern, published in 1891, Lewis Wright reasoned that electric light bulbs \u2018consist[ing] of an incandescent filament of carbon, have lately been applied with some success to the ordinary slide lantern, and where the electric current can be laid on, is a very convenient and handy radiant\u2019 (p 42). In 1878, the American inventor and businessman Thomas Edison was granted a patent for an electric lamp, and in 1883 he joined forces with the Englishman Joseph Swan and formed the Edison and Swan Electric Light Company, and introduced a lamp through which a current being received provided the light source for lantern projection, though it took various forms, such as the new incandescent Ediswan \u2018Pointolite\u2019 glow-lamp\u2019 (Wright, 1891, p 39). The innovative nature of the electric light lantern and its safer form of illumination was sometimes underlined by mentioning its relations to the bulky batteries or dynamos, or the availability of supply, and suitable voltage, whether it was continuous, constant or direct. For instance, as Wright explained, \u2018the current available from a public supply may be\u2026unlimited so far as our purpose is concerned, and the amount actually used depends only on the total electrical resistance of our circuit\u2019 (Wright, 1891, p 40). In an age when electricity had not yet taken the place of house gas, and a current was still not always available in as simple a form as gas then was, an arc or incandescent lamp had to be carefully selected to match the available current, or the circuit to suit the particular lamp.\nFor J L Payne, the innovative nature of the electric light lantern and its safer form of illuminating his slides not only came in the discovery that he made \u2013 the physical nature of fractured mandible patients that had come under his care at the Croydon and Wandsworth military hospitals \u2013 but also the scientific validity he attached to the images shown on the screen. The opening paragraphs in his article demonstrate the authority of these slides: \u2018I propose\u2026to deal briefly with the types of cases met with, the nature of the displacements, the general lines of treatment\u2019 (Payne, 1916b, p 68). This sentence indicates that the images mattered because their production could be traced to his individual experiences of the patients he had seen. This page of photographs shows the side and front face view of a patient who had lost all the anterior portion of his maxilla from the second molar on the left side to the second premolar on the right, with loss of substance to his upper lip and lower portion of the mandible on the left side (Figure 4). After projecting his slides for society members to see, Payne then described what they were seeing: \u2018In so many patients there was serious loss of substance, bony union could not reasonably be hoped for; only in the slighter cases was the error in occlusion not likely to be serious\u2019 (Payne, 1916b, p 74). This is an example of how surgeons presented epistemic value through the images to visualise observations of multiple patients and communicate scientific evidence.[6]\nSpeakers used slides to highlight and explain specific characteristics in types of injury or to contrast the differences in a range of patients, so that others in the room could recognise their nature and comprehend recovery times. Projecting the slide on to the screen allowed for illuminating and enlarging to facial details several feet in diameter. By comparing the photographic results of a range of patients, the surgeon\u2019s performance could point out particular elements of interest on the screen so that others could gain an understanding of the possibilities and limitations of treatment.[7] Visual differentiation not only taught other surgeons how to recognise some of the predictable, and therefore avoidable, problems and complexities in treating these particular injuries in advance, but stimulating such a dialogue also provided access to first-hand experience of these patients to those who had not yet had direct contact or enough experience of their own. Through an analysis of what Erin O\u2019Connor describes as a \u2018collapse of the individual\u2026into the identity of disease\u2019 or injury, medical photography renders the person incidental to the portrait and stands in for direct observation itself (1999, p 235). This interchangeable relationship meant that practitioners were taught to read living processes into these surgeries and were given new and immediate proof of the efficiency of these experimentations. The projected images carried enough information for surgeons to assess treatment or to plan-out their own sessions. Photography came to define surgical activity, showing how much skin, muscle or bone surgeons needed to remove or attach in theatre.\nThere was much professional knowledge to be attained by these projections; words alone never inform the surgeon or trainee of the things most necessary to a safe operation. Learning to read slides in the meeting room involved the full understanding of the procedural stages of an operation. Through the lantern, surgeons harnessed their slides to develop sophisticated visual strategies to portray operative movements and sequencing. As Palfreyman and Rabier have noted, photography and image-making challenged surgeons to rethink their approaches to surgery and body vision, to both master new technologies and instrumentation and to relearn their fundamental skills of hand-eye coordination (2017, p 294). Good teaching comprised the picturing of space and time as well as accessing clinical evidence of the surgical outcomes, so as to piece together the material and the immaterial actions to perceive the invisible techniques, steps and procedures. These dynamic processes of interaction and exchange between visible and invisible matter taught groups of surgeons to venture beyond the boundary of textual communication, into an imaginative and sensory space where mental projection, like the lantern, exposed the steps and timings they wished to recreate to join-up the sequenced \u2018moments of observation\u2019 thrown on to the screen."},

This also chimed with our efforts to address issues around difference and disfigurement (RCS, 2007; Gosling, 2012), and to incorporate disability into museum practice as a matter of course (RCS, 2012).Accordingly, with the support of military clinicians and the Ministry of Defence, Midgley gained access to the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre, at Headley Court in Surrey. Over two years she worked with healthcare professionals and recovering service personnel to represent the long and challenging process of rehabilitation (see Figure 4). The soldiers in recovery were referred to by the clinicians as \u2018patients\u2019 rather than service users or clients, and they identified themselves as such. In response to Midgley\u2019s request to sketch, made via their clinicians, they responded positively. Royal Air Force doctor Clare Walton was in command at Headley Court at the time. She recalled: \u2018It is not always easy to predict how patients will react to such personal requests but in this case they also loved the idea. The drawing sessions were unobtrusive and sympathetic. All the patients who volunteered were soon fully engaged and enjoying the experience\u2019 (Walton, 2014, p 317). Midgley\u2019s artistic process involved close proximity \u2013 a common feature of both reportage and medical art \u2013 and together with her sitters\u2019 curiosity this engendered dialogue. Her work reflected \u2018the intimacy afforded me as I worked among and alongside patients and their medical staff during rehabilitation and training\u2019 (Midgley, 2014, p 264). Although she noted names and ranks when possible, she did not formally record these exchanges. She later reflected, \u2018the soldiers [were] very private and I didn't wish to intrude on their concentration nor on their privacy. Nor did I wish their staff to think I was probing where I shouldn\u2019t.\u2019[2]\nMidgley produced 155 drawings, including surgeons in training at Strensall Camp near York, at the RCS, and at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire. She engaged with and represented clinicians (Walton, 2014) including prosthetists (see Midgley, 2014, pp 233, 296\u2013297). The final exhibition included historical and contemporary military medical equipment. We also wanted to connect this technical-clinical story with patient perspectives on their rehabilitation and the relationship with healthcare professionals. In the 62 Headley Court artworks, 57 different personnel in rehabilitation are represented (some of them multiple times as Midgley followed their experience), of whom 19 are named.We planned to juxtapose this series with 72 Henry Tonks pieces. We set out to gather as much information as we could about the two groups of patients, past and present. For the former we went to the case files, the First World War records, and to existing historical work (Bamji, 2017), and gathered the most comprehensive public account of those patients to date. Ironically, it proved far more difficult to find information from the living personnel. As far as appropriate we tried via the medical services and social media to elicit testimony from the men and women Midgley sketched, but to little avail. Only three responded: two head injury patients (Sapper Manoa Madraitabua and John Dawson of the Grenadier Guards) and one prosthetic user, Andy Reid. After triggering an improvised explosive device in Afghanistan, Reid had endured limb loss and spent months at Headley Court (Reid, 2013). He was thoughtful in his response to Figure 5 when he returned to the RCS to participate in a documentary (Foxtrot Films, 2015):\nI visited Headley Court many times during the rehabilitation following my injuries from an Improvised Explosive Device in 2009. This picture is of one of my last visits to Headley Court \u2013 I left the army in 2012. It was an exciting time, but I was also reflecting on sad times.I thought it strange when Julia asked if she could sketch me during my prosthesis fitting \u2013 a random lady wants to draw a picture \u2013 a bit of an intrusion on what is quite an intimate process. But so many people come and go when you\u2019re at Headley Court that I said it didn\u2019t bother me. In the army you don\u2019t get much personal space. In this picture I was just going to get up and walk out of the room \u2013 I was about to attach the other prosthetic, as there\u2019s no point in wearing one leg. I don\u2019t wear that electric arm very often, because it\u2019s heavy. Julia\u2019s picture looks to me a bit unfinished; and without my leg on I look a bit unfinished too. I think the more people know about rehabilitation the better. Soldiers\u2019 deaths are in the news, but not what happens to those of us recovering from injuries (quoted in Midgley, 2014, p 187).\nThe interpretation of Tonks\u2019 work in the exhibition War, Art and Surgery was full of personal detail, albeit with few direct quotes from the soldiers. The labels next to Midgley\u2019s work, by contrast, were brief, and the contemporary material displayed was dominated by a surgical narrative.There were several reasons for this. Many of the personnel had demobilised in the interim; they were no longer part of the military-medical system and were busy getting on with their lives. We cannot know whether they were happy to be framed as \u2018patients\u2019 during the rehabilitation, and then in the exhibition next to the First World War patients \u2013 but their silence indicated they may no longer have seen themselves in this light. Arguably, part of the function of Headley Court was to effect a change from amputation patient to prosthetic user. The approach soliciting feedback then came from the museum team, employees of a Royal College rather than the artist they had warmed to. In retrospect, curators could have worked more closely with Midgley and her sitters in situ while she was drawing. We could have involved elements of co-curation in the exhibition itself (Boon, 2011), as the Science Museum would go on to do with veterans living with post-traumatic stress disorder in the last section of the Wounded exhibition (Freeth, 2016). Nevertheless, at the RCS we were pleased to have represented their experience in the gallery alongside the advances in medical care and the accomplishments of surgeons. But aside from Reid\u2019s eloquence, these prosthetic users are represented with silent dignity."},

This three-year project, beginning in September 2015 and ending in September 2018, was a response to a call from the European Commission for research projects which would further the understanding of the relationship between nuclear energy and society. As such HoNESt examines how nuclear energy and society have interacted across Europe and the United States from 1945 to the present day and seeks to inform discussion and debate about the role of nuclear energy, and society\u2019s ability to shape it, now and in the future. Around these research aims, the project has been structured to facilitate comparative, transnational and interdisciplinary working.\nHoNESt is a consortium of 23 institutions (largely universities and national museums), with groups of historians and social scientists working together. Scholars from various institutions across Europe, including museums, were invited to participate in the project based on their experience as historical researchers. HoNESt was a natural fit for the Science Museum\u2019s expertise in researching the public\u2019s engagement with science, as part of the growing number of researchers in the Museum\u2019s Research and Public History department. Project management is provided by staff at the University of Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona, but because there are so many people working on the project, researchers are divided into groups, called \u2018Work Packages\u2019, which in turn have their own leaders across Europe. Each Work Package has a number of reports to write according to a prearranged schedule. For example, my work at the Science Museum, and most of the historical research in HoNESt, has taken place in a research group of historians (Work Package 2), which is responsible for creating a Short Country Report examining the history of nuclear energy in each country. Keeping all of these normally independent historians on track to write easily comparable Reports has required a highly defined structure and careful management. The Reports have been through three completely different structures, and have been re-drafted many times. Although some of these changes were arrived at in our large group of historians, a lot of the more interesting questions and challenges came from Work Package 3, which is made up of historians and social scientists, and meets regularly via Skype, and in person whenever possible. It is in the meetings for Work Package 3 that the first differences between our \u2018habits of mind\u2019 became clear."},

Among the stated goals, there were the preservation of the national technological landmarks and the fostering of national productivity through the promotion of invention (Kunz, 1913). The museum was incorporated in 1914, but the First World War stopped the plans, which were only resumed when Henry R Towne, a wealthy industrialist and a fervent Taylorist, died in 1924 and bequeathed his fortune to the establishment of an industrial museum in New York City, on the condition that other donors could be found.[6]\nThe new institution, still headed by Kunz, immediately looked to Europe \u2013 and Europe answered back. In November 1925, Oskar von Miller, who untiringly acted as a missionary spreading the gospel of the industrial museum idea all over the world (Lindqvist, 1993), visited the United States to give support and advice to the museums that were being projected in Chicago and New York.[7] The first action of the board of trustees of both museums was to plan for study trips abroad. The Museum of the Peaceful Arts allocated 50,000 dollars from Towne\u2019s bequest for travels in order to look for suitable models. In Chicago, Waldemar Kaempffert, the newly hired director of the museum, immediately embarked on a two-month European trip (Pridmore, pp 31\u201332).\nThese study trips invariably included a detailed analysis of the Deutsches Museum in Munich, the Technisches Museum in Vienna, the Science Museum in London, and the Conservatoire des Arts et M\u00e9tiers in Paris. These were the four institutions that had been canonised by Charles Richards\u2019 influential book The Industrial Museum, which became a sort of Bible for the industrial museum movement. In 1924, Richards had been commissioned by the General Education Board to tour Europe in order to make a comparative survey of the biggest industrial museums.[8] The resulting book systematically compared them in terms of scope, history, building, administration, finance, structure and divisions, collection, techniques of display, educational activities and internal organisation of the staff. The high level of quantitative detail, including illustrations and budgets, was aimed at providing a practical guide for transplanting this cultural institution into the United States (Richards, 1925).\nRichards, who would eventually become the director of the New York Museum of Science and Industry between 1931 and 1934, had been an omnipresent figure both in the movement for the promotion of vocational education and the industrial museum movement.[9] Significantly, the same key characters involved in the 1910s in the National Society for the Promotion of Industrial Education were also behind the foundation of industrial museums a decade later. As historian Russell Jones has convincingly argued, both initiatives must be read as part of an ideological battle for cultural hegemony. The ultimate aim of the promoters was to morally uplift workers and to propagate a deterministic idea of an autonomous technology in order to soothe labour unrest by presenting corporate capitalism as an unavoidable result of internal technological progress (Jones, 2001; Wallace, 1996).[10]\nRichards presented European industrial museums as institutions of great cultural and political significance. According to him, they should provide modern men with the awareness of their role in a too complex industrial society. Unlike any village in India, where all the production processes could be directly witnessed on the streets, or at the shops of the artisans, western industrial societies hid its most basic processes behind factory walls. Industrial museums had to metaphorically tear those walls down in order to \u2018reveal to the eye [...] the industrial basis of our present-day life\u2019 (Richards, 1925, p 2).\nAccording to Richards, the European industrial museums achieved this goal by using a historical approach which presented the main steps of the evolution of every branch of industry \u2013 each corresponding to a basic human need \u2013 from the early times to the present. While the Conservatoire, more focused on technical education in a narrower sense, was a repository that fell short of excellence in this regard, Richards portrayed the Deutsches Museum as an example of how this could be achieved through didactic exhibition methods, and the smaller Technisches Museum as the ideal model upon which to base the importation of this institution into the United States.[11]\nDespite having Richards\u2019 detailed guidelines available, the Museum of the Peaceful Arts sent their own \u2018pilgrims\u2019 abroad. In the spring of 1926, engineer Calvin Rice, who was the secretary of both the museum and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, departed for a two-month European trip in order to study the four main industrial museums, and the trustees travelling to Europe that summer were also requested to report on the fields they were acquainted with.[12] That autumn, a special committee consisting of Calvin Rice, Carl Mitman and Joseph Roe was formed with the purpose of analysing the information gathered by all the \u2018pilgrims\u2019 and writing a report for internal use with practical recommendations.[13]\nThe report dealt with issues such as location, architectural style, building costs, sources of income, staff, or operating expenses, which were systematically studied through a comparative analysis and interviews with the directors of the main European museums. It also included two detailed full scripts of the transportation and machine-tools sections, elaborated by Mitman and Roe, which combined a typological and a historical approach.[14] The report emphasised the need for working closely with industries, and argued that each industrial sector should be more or less prominently featured according to its relative importance in the region. This was established through a quantitative and comparative assessment taking into consideration variables such as the annual value of products, the average number of wage earners, or the number of companies in each sector. Thus, while agriculture should have a prominent position in Chicago, the sectors that should have a stronger representation in New York were textile, machine-tools, transportation, and electrical and chemical industries. Emphasis was also put on the need for acquiring first the machines that were representative of the current state of the sector so that workers and the public in general could be better instructed.[15]\nThe archaeocentric approach by Richards and the more contempocentric approach by Rice, Mitman and Roe reflect the two overlapping tendencies which shaped the initial importation of European industrial museums into New York City. In terms of their European referents, the first one embraced the philosophy of the Deutsches Museum, while the second one was more inspired by the Conservatoire. In both cases, the American background was the rhetoric of the vocational education movement. On the one hand, industrial museums should give individual workers, and citizens in general, an awareness of their role in the broader social scheme \u2013 as seen through the managerial lens. On the other hand, they should increase the level of technical competence in the country, as well as provide a venue in which to train visitors in the character-building moral qualities deriving from manual work."},

These are the questions at the core of working as Curator of Art Collections at the Science Museum and overseeing a series of major commissions for Medicine: The Wellcome Galleries, which opened in Autumn 2019. Art has been part of science museums for decades, and part of the Science Museum since its inception, whether in the permanent collections or, more recently, as part of commissioning, display and events programmes. One argument for bringing artists into these spaces has long been the inclusion of new voices and new perspectives, ones that question the assumptions and values of science.[1] A principle of the medicine galleries was, likewise, the importance of putting varied experiences and voices at the heart of the displays.[2] This article therefore takes the approach of an \u2018In conversation\u2019 with three of the artists commissioned for the galleries \u2013 Eleanor Crook, Marc Quinn and Studio Roso \u2013 to put artistic and curatorial voices in dialogue, and to consider different ways in which these kinds of collaboratively produced artworks can answer the questions posed at the start. --Born out of the Great Exhibition of 1851, the Science Museum\u2019s founding collections originally formed part of \u2018the South Kensington Museum\u2019, which opened in 1857. This was on the site of what is now the Victoria and Albert Museum and combined art and science collections. When the Science Museum was formally created as a separate institution in 1909, it was founded with collections that included artworks from a side project by the curator of the Patent Museum, Bennett Woodcroft: \u2018A National Gallery of Portraits of Inventors, Discoverers and Introducers of the Useful Arts.\u2019 Artworks continued to join the collection from that point, largely selected for their representational value, and housed within the relevant scientific or technological collections departments. With the formation of a designated \u2018Pictorial Collection\u2019 in the 1970s, for the first time the full wealth of the image collections could be seen and catalogued by curator Wendy Sheridan, who also made significant additions up to 2005.[3]\nIn the 1990s, the Museum developed a contemporary arts programme, and a policy (instigated in 1996) that it would \u2018integrate art within the development process for all major capital projects, both buildings and galleries\u2019 with the intention that this would enable the public to explore science and technology through art, create innovative environments, allow artists to engage with the Museum\u2019s collections and expertise, and particularly promote the exploration of new digital media.[4] From 1999 to 2014, under the leadership of Hannah Redler Hawes, the Science Museum Arts Programme thus worked with contemporary artists to produce temporary and permanent gallery interventions, exhibitions, research, residencies and events. These focused on bringing artistic perspectives to bear on the impacts and social contexts of science, often raising moral or ethical questions. The works commissioned by SMAP for permanent galleries, including Energy (2005\u20132018) and Who am I? (from 2000, updated 2010) as well as a number of temporary displays, served to found a new, separate contemporary art collection for the Museum (Redler Hawes, 2019; 2016).Arriving in 2017, as the third iteration of art curator at the Museum, my remit combined the collection with the commissioning programme. Alongside the development of Medicine: The Wellcome Galleries, we have sought to bring the Museum\u2019s art collections and commissioning into closer conversation. Developed for permanent galleries with an intended lifespan of 25 years, these four new commissions will be part of the Museum\u2019s approach to art for a generation. They are therefore as important in what they bring to the permanent record of art and science in dialogue within the collection \u2013 to the understanding of those disciplines\u2019 histories, iconographies and structures \u2013 as they are to the narratives and visual experiences of their specific galleries. In the interviews below, each artist has reflected on what is special to them about creating work for a medicine gallery and a science museum. In working with them on the commissions, and in asking these questions, as the curator I sought to understand and articulate how these works can make viewers look at and think differently about histories of medicine, but also histories of art. Each work speaks to its gallery, to the Museum\u2019s broader art collections and, crucially, to broader considerations of representation and iconography in how art and medicine engage with each other.[5]\nMedicine: The Wellcome Galleries was a ten-year project, within which the Science Museum actively worked with the artists for three years, and I joined as curator for the last two. Commissions are by their very nature collaborative projects, in which I see my role as curator being the conduit and translator between the artist and Museum teams, making the collaboration smooth and fruitful, whether over practical constraints or conceptual relationship to the wider gallery. As with most commissions, these started with a brief, developed by the Museum team in parallel with the gallery designs and curatorial strategy. In February/March 2017, the Museum team had approached artists for each commission based on aspirations for what the artworks would respond and speak to in each gallery. In each case the brief explained the space that an artist was asked to fill \u2013 both physically and conceptually \u2013 giving the physical, budgetary and logistical parameters, providing details of the anticipated audience, gallery designs and surrounding collection displays, and outlining the area of gallery narrative with which the artist was asked to engage. If interested, artists were asked to submit a concept for their proposed artwork, and the team appointed an artist for each brief based on these ideas.\nFrom the Autumn of 2017 each artist then worked up a developed proposal for their piece with feedback from the Museum team on its connections to the wider gallery. Together we began to think through the narrative of each piece and how these would speak to the stories of medicine and art in their respective galleries, from anatomical illustration to votive offerings. In 2018 a technical design with exact weights, dimensions, materials and technical specifications brought in the next layer of collaboration as relevant Museum teams commented and planned for the artworks\u2019 future lives in a permanent gallery, considering electrics, maintenance, climate conditions and floor strengthening. As the galleries neared completion in 2019, we worked with each artist and their teams to develop the interpretation labels, here again balancing the artist and curatorial voice. We collaborated to document each piece fully for future staff, visitors and researchers, part of wider work to develop the layers of information that sit around an artwork, as both commission and collection object. --Despite representing only a few of the 3,000 objects on display in Medicine: The Wellcome Galleries, the visitors\u2019 first encounter with the four art commissions is undoubtedly as major visual interventions.[6] Each artwork acts as a focal point, central to four out of the five galleries, experienced almost immediately on whichever route the visitor takes to enter the suite of spaces. While walking through the ground floor of the Museum, Studio Roso\u2019s vibrant \u2018Bloom\u2019 can be seen when looking up at the balcony galleries, spread across the ceiling of Medicine and Communities, glowing with movement to evoke the spread of epidemic disease (see Collections Online). When entering from the front of the Museum, Marc Quinn\u2019s monumental \u2018Self-Conscious Gene\u2019 introduces viewers to the Medicine and Bodies gallery with a tattooed sculptural figure (see Collections Online). Visitors arriving from the back of the Museum, into the darker, contemplative space of the Faith, Hope and Fear gallery, find \u2018Santa Medicina\u2019 by Eleanor Crook, providing a space to think about what makes \u2018a good death\u2019 and who or what individuals turn to in their moments of need (see Collections Online). Anyone joining from the large central lifts and heading right into Medicine and Treatments will discover that the gallery is peopled by the photographer Si\u00e2n Davey\u2019s life-size portraits of patients and practitioners, presented in two different photographs.[7]\nThe visual power of these pieces certainly draws the visitor in, but each also further works to connect narratives of art and medicine within and across the galleries. Each commission is tied into both the collections and stories of its gallery, and broader histories and dialogues of art, science and medicine in the collections. Marc Quinn\u2019s \u2018Self-Conscious Gene\u2019 represents Rick Genest, an actor, model and muse, who is perhaps best known for his appearance in Lady Gaga\u2019s music video \u2018Born this Way\u2019. Genest\u2019s full-body tattoos mix anatomical imagery and popular tattoo iconography, such as spiders\u2019 webs, gravestones, insects and knuckle lettering.[8] In choosing these, Genest made of himself both a decaying corpse and the kind of figure known as an \u00e9corch\u00e9, where the skin is removed to show the musculature.[9] This imagery connects to the study of both art history and medicine, both the careful observation of anatomy to understand the living and the use of memento mori that remind us of the inevitability of death. Quinn speaks below about how, for him, this was important to connect the contemporary world and pop culture into the Museum, allowing visitors to relate their modern bodies to the historic ones on show. For me, it also connects the visual cultures of tattooing to those of anatomy.[10] The book that Genest holds is an anatomical dictionary on the pages of which Quinn has reproduced two famous images from Vesalius\u2019s seminal work published in 1543, De Humani Corporis Fabrica (On the Fabric of the Human Body), which offered the first comprehensive visual account of human anatomy. A copy is displayed nearby in the Medicine and Bodies gallery.\nEleanor Crook also has a deep interest in histories of collections and imagery.[11] Her bronze figure \u2018Santa Medicina\u2019 is both surgeon and saint, offering an imagined patron saint of medicine that combines faith with treatment. Crook weaves iconographies from medicine and religion together: the stethoscope becomes a rosary, the surgeon\u2019s mirror a monstrance, the dress opens down the back like medical scrubs to reveal \u00e9corch\u00e9 muscle. The bell-shaped skirt is covered in amulets, connecting to rich displays of amulets and votives elsewhere in the Faith, Hope and Fear gallery. Many people involved in the wider medicine galleries project suggested an amulet from their own medical experience, and I am confident that my teenage self would be particularly delighted that years of much-hated orthodontic treatment are represented in a retainer brace that Crook has somehow made beautiful. The wax figure sheltered in the skirts of \u2018Santa Medicina\u2019 seeks to raise deep questions and engender a range of emotions, responding to the commission brief that this piece should encourage visitors to think about their own mortality. As Crook explains, this is a material and visual homage to her first understanding of death at a young age when faced with a monumental tomb. Her figure responds to the rich religious iconography from across the world that can be found in Wellcome\u2019s medical collections at the Science Museum, as well as showing how important shared histories of materials like wax and bronze are across artistic and medical practice.\nStudio Roso\u2019s installation \u2018Bloom\u2019 is simultaneously mesmerising and slightly unnerving, evoking both the subtle joy of opening blossom and the creeping spread of a rash or fungus. This vast kinetic sculpture helps to give viewers a sense of the scale at which health and medicine operate at a group rather than an individual level. \u2018Bloom\u2019 recalls a large diagram in a textbook or scientific paper, where each branching structure ends in a series of propellers. These spin, light up and change colour in a number of different imagined \u2018narratives\u2019 that evoke how disease spreads. As Knudsen and Nielsen discuss, this was a design and engineering challenge to produce the piece on such a vast scale, including creating a VR simulation to see the subtle movements of light and material that are central to much of their work.[12] As a digital and kinetic artwork, \u2018Bloom\u2019 continues the development of digital works commissioned and collected by the Science Museum Arts Programme. Through its non-figurative form, the work likewise emphasises the importance of histories of diagram and of how scientific ideas have been visualised for the public. This kind of branching tree structure has been used in many visual ways to classify and categorise knowledge, most famously in Darwin\u2019s work that led to On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection (1859).[13]\nUnfortunately, Si\u00e2n Davey was unable to take part in this \u2018In conversation\u2019, yet dialogue was core to the photographs that she produced for the galleries, which were part of a broader participation project. Her compelling life-size portraits stand throughout the Medicine and Bodies displays and extend like a visual spine down the Medicine and Treatments gallery. Davey worked as a psychotherapist for many years before turning to photography. Her work regularly engages with different mental landscapes and with sitters that might be seen as outside of the so-called \u2018norms\u2019 of medicine or society. From receiving our brief in March 2018, Davey worked with the Science Museum\u2019s participation group \u2018When medicine defines what\u2019s normal\u2019 to produce a series of portraits for Medicine and Bodies. She developed portraits of a range of sitters living with different medical conditions, which are presented both physically in the space and digitally on kiosks. The participation group shaped the choice of sitters as well as Davey\u2019s compositions, including her choice of pose and background colours. For Medicine and Treatments, Davey photographed a number of individuals already working with the Museum around their experience of receiving or giving medical treatment. Capturing their personalities and building on her discussions with the participation group, each sitter appears twice in the physical portraits, with differences of pose and expression to help build a more complete picture of each individual\u2019s character.\nThe Science Museum\u2019s curatorial team helped to facilitate Davey\u2019s portrait shoots in a studio in south-east London in the summer of 2018, making collaboration even more key to this commission. We learnt practical lessons around finding and preparing the right studio space, we brokered the relationships that then developed visibly in the shoot built on Davey\u2019s empathetic approach, we observed the careful way that each sitter was given time and space, offered make-up and styling to be their preferred version of themselves. Davey joined the Museum in March 2019 for the conference \u2018Representing the Medical Body\u2019 at which she spoke compellingly about how we love and care for things that are different to us.[14] Her turn to photography comes originally from using the camera to understand her relationship with her daughter Alice, who was born with Downs Syndrome (Davey, 2015). Davey brought many conference participants to tears with her thoughtful and deeply personal commentary on human vulnerability to feelings of shame, anger, grief and pride and how one person\u2019s diagnosis or lived experience is only a small part of society\u2019s relationship to difference. For the Museum, not only do Davey\u2019s photographs make people fundamentally present in the galleries, at life size, but they also help visitors and staff to think about who is represented in the Museum\u2019s collections and how we challenge who has historically been thought worthy of a portrait. In 2020, this has only become more important.--When developing \u2018Bloom\u2019 with Studio Roso, we could never have imagined the ways in which its meaning and relevance would shift as the Covid-19 pandemic struck. No longer do visitors need reminding of how epidemic disease might spread, or a way to visualise it, rather perhaps this mesmerising piece has shifted to create a space of reflection on the power that illness holds in our lives. Indeed, all of the artists reflect below on how these artworks feel to them now, one year on and in a very different world. Reflecting as curator, I come back to a conviction that art in science museums can play a fundamental role in showing how science is cultural, and the importance of visual histories in that story. These commissions each bring different histories of art and medicine into the galleries, strengthening the dialogue between the visual cultures of both."},

Power appears to roll back and forth in variable, often low-frequency waves between experts (however labelled) and laypeople (however labelled), as conditions and events become significant and then recede. For example, in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries in the UK, when reading became a non-elite capability, and a public emerged for literature about nature, the educated elite generated non-elite literatures not only as a marketing opportunity but also in order to guide lay readers into particular ways of knowing and areas of knowledge (Bowler, 2009; Fyffe and Lightman, 2007). The elite thus maintained the exclusivity of their literatures and knowledges by swamping the market at the cheaper end with material more suited, in their eyes, to the public, and which were intended to guide the new readers into particular political and career paths. The newspapers, for most of their history, were deemed to express public opinion; but with the establishment of the popular press in the early twentieth century, the lens of public opinion became the opinion poll, conducted by agencies in the pay of elites. Similarly, when the public started to engage in further education, the elites did not open the universities to them; instead, new colleges and classes were provided that, while they offered advancement, also attempted to guide workers in certain intellectual and practical directions and divert them from others (Billinge, 1982; Porter, 1990). In each of these cases, what looks like an \u2018opening up\u2019 is mitigated by the extension of, and responsive innovation in, forms of elite control and management. To use Bourdieu\u2019s terms, what might look like an activation of the public serves instead to discipline them (Bourdieu, 1984). And chafing under this discipline, the public finds new forms of activity for resisting it.As the twentieth century passed, the distance between elites and laypeople was replaced by a fluidity in many dimensions \u2013 wealth, education, mobility, political agency \u2013 and the opportunities increased for the less powerful to sidestep control from higher up (Giddens, 1998; Castells, 2000). Together, now, they tussle for liberation and control, activation and discipline: the experts share some knowledge with the laypeople, the laypeople select from it, reconstruct it, and exploit it in unexpected ways; thus altered, the knowledge is deemed by elites to have been devalued, and they say so; the laypeople lose respect for elites, who suffer this devaluation in return and attempt to regain status by sharing something new they consider of value, and the cycle continues. In the contemporary world of multiple expertises, multiple audiences, multiple channels and timeless time, the tussle becomes a frenzy, and then blurs.\u00a0 \u00a0One clear event, though, is the emergence of public engagement as a mode of science communication in the UK, and its fall-out elsewhere (Lock, 2009). By public engagement, I mean managed dialogues between experts, of some kind, and non-experts, or activities with a dialogical element (for a useful discussion of definitions, see Escobar, 2011). In the new professional community of science communication in the UK, public engagement quickly became the \u2018gold standard\u2019, and more traditional forms of communication such as lectures and museums of objects were disparaged as oppressive and undemocratic (Gregory and Lock, 2008). The past, and the alternatives, were swept away and squeezed out by policy-orientated funding decisions. Public engagement looks like an opening up, but can instead be understood as a managerial phase in the history of science communication: in the science communication boom of the 1980s onwards, the opening-up of the scientific culture generated resistance as well as support; the disquiet of the elites was expressed as concern about a lack of trust for expertise; and the time had come to clamp down. The public now were to become scientific citizens: they should participate, learn, discuss and debate (for further discussion, see Stirling, 2008; Durodie, 2009)."},

In a closed chilled room, I inspected a spectacle of bodies, caught in corsets, staring at me, they were passing before my eyes like in a parade. But they were patients on glass, flat and hard to the touch, only visible when held toward a light source. I sat in one of the rooms at the depot storage of the Boerhaave Museum in Leiden, looking at patient images on black and white glass negatives. And I wondered, how can I as a curator share these fascinating but personal images with others in a meaningful way? Two aspects seemed to hold me back. Firstly, clinical photographs[1] are fascinating and educative in many ways, but appear somehow to carry a part of (the history of) that person (Biernoff, 2012). Clinical photography, as modern photographer Ian Berle concisely defined, \u2018is used to record disease, dysfunction and trauma\u2019 (Berle, 2008). By putting such images on public display, is there a violation of privacy at play? Secondly, I pondered on the role and responsibility of a museum of the history of medicine in staging images that feel private because of their intimate subject matter in a public exhibition space. These issues are at the basis of this paper and come together in the act of curating \u2013 \u2018to care for\u2019 \u2013 historical photographic collections in exhibition spaces.Medical photographs feature regularly in exhibitions in museums of science and medicine, libraries or war museums.[2] Yet often the photographs on display are treated or presented as if they were either standalone artworks or illustrations to objects, and not themselves treated as objects, distributed and functioning in a diversity of practices and localities. Neither is the act of looking \u2013 what happens between the spectator and the image within the museum space \u2013 made into a topic to address explicitly. Focusing on their aesthetic qualities, historical medical photographs have on occasion been displayed in museums or galleries in art-historical settings.[3] However, scholars have criticised the isolation and absence of reflection of the social institutional historical uses of medical photographs (Cross &amp; Peck, 2010). The question arises of how historical uses of medical photography echo throughout exhibition practices.Clinical photography collections, I suggest, are \u2018sensitive\u2019 collections within the museum context. I argue that patient photographs belong to the same family as colonial objects, colonial photography, war photography and human remains.[4] The family ties that bind these materials are characterised by a constant confrontation with suffering, questions of ownership or (a lack of) control thereof.When medical photography entered into non-medical domains privacy issues emerged. It is these privacy issues that cast a shadow of sensitivity on the medical material. Consequently, privacy considerations also play a role in the public display of historical medical photographs. Indeed, museums themselves actively move these images into a different context of display and use than that for which they were originally produced. Museums thereby activate a continuous balancing act, where a thin line between exhibiting and exposing emerges. It is my purpose in this article to inform museum workers and historians in the field of history of science and medicine about the specific issues involved in medical photography in museum contexts and to discuss how displaying these images involves and unravels more than you might initially think. The relationship between clinical photograph collections and museums is not as straightforward as it may seem. Personal pictures involve power and privacy.Let us follow an image made of one of the glass patients from its creation to today. The journey takes us from a 1920s seaside tuberculosis sanatorium via photographers and physicians exploring ways to record patients, to privacy discussions and the rediscovery of long forgotten images. I will first discuss the historical context of privacy and clinical photography. Subsequently I explore the current curatorial questions and exhibition ethics for displaying historical clinical photographs. The possible encounters between patient P in a museum gallery with spectators one century after the creation of the image forms only the start of new journeys to come. The key to understanding such contemporary settings of the image, I contend, also lies in its historical context.\nThis image of patient P is part of a Dutch collection of glass negatives with clinical images from the early twentieth century.[5] Made in a Dutch seaside sanatorium for young children suffering from tuberculosis, the collection contains 255 boxes with almost 3,000 glass negatives dated between 1908 and 1940. Partly clinical images, partly X-rays, the images cover a broad range of visual signs of tuberculosis, internal and superficial. As with the other clinical images this example was probably made by the director of this institute, the Rotterdam Zeehospitium. In 1922, the female director Van Dorp-Beucker most likely wanted to minutely fix and closely monitor P in order to clinically follow the consequences and development of her battle against the tuberculosis infection. In 1922, at the time the image of P was taken, physicians and photographers applied photography to document a wide range of what was considered as outward visible pathology. From skin diseases to war trauma, psychiatry, tropical infections and orthopaedics, the clinical photograph of the patient was increasingly used to record disease progression. Similarly, the photograph of P functioned as evidence of the healing process. In her photographic image she revealed her skin wounds on the forehead and shoulder whilst seated on a treatment table.The clinical images become part of the patient file \u2013 a most intimate personal document for recording patient histories. Such a personal, be it temporal, record of this patient\u2019s often painful struggle with a disease heavily contrasts with the voluntary sitter of the physician\u2019s portrait.[6] A demonstration of one\u2019s professional authority versus revealing pain and trauma. The patient file documenting bodily trouble set against the physicians\u2019 carte de visite in a collector\u2019s album highlights a division of power. In the first photograph (see Figure 2) Dr Halbertsma, an eminent Dutch physician, shows himself perfectly groomed and ready for fame. In the second photograph (see Figure 3), a young half-naked boy who stayed at the TB sanatorium demonstrates his visible wounds and scars inflicted by the disease. In both cases, the representations exercise a strong individual agency.\nEven in the early days of clinical photography some physicians worried about the so-called \u2018indecency\u2019 of some patient images and their \u2018direct\u2019 documentation. From the middle of the nineteenth century, many physicians embraced photography as a technology with great potential. Low costs, accurate representation, and life-like depiction of patients were seen as the most important advantages. Physicians considered accurate images as indispensable clinical tools for teaching and promoting emerging disciplines such as dermatology.[7] During the explosion of photography in the 1900s, the newly found way to depict patients became contested. One example painfully brought this to the surface. The American dermatologist George Henry Fox used his photographs of patients with skin diseases in talks he held at medical societies in the United States and Canada. After one of his lectures, the operator of the lantern-slide projector came up to him and said: \u2018Say, Doctor! One of those women\u2019s faces shown on the screen was the very image of my sister-in-law.\u2019 In his memoires Fox recounts how uneasy he felt at the time because he \u2018remembered that a picture of a private patient taken with the assurance that it was not intended for publication had somehow got into the collection of cases from [his] clinic and that this particular patient came from this very city\u2019 (Fox, 1926). This fascinating incident indicates the kind of reactions provoked by non-medical audiences encountering medical subjects in projected images. The unease felt by Fox also hints at a desire to protect his patient against unwanted onlookers.With the introduction of the Kodak hand-held camera in the 1880s a new era of pictorial representation and amateur photography was established. These new representation practices urged a small group of doctors to debate the popularity of medical photography. They argued that photographs were used too often and patients were unnecessarily exposed. A plea for \u2018decency\u2019 said that \u2018the scope of the photograph should be confined to the parts in which the phenomenon noted occurs; that the rest of the body, being unnecessary to the demonstration, be left out of the field, or be suitably covered up\u2019 (Medicus, 1894). Besides indecency, revealing the patients\u2019 identity was also seen as a key problem: \u2018Not that all these pictures [\u2026] are objectionable on the score of indecency, for they are not; but they are or appear to be of such character as to be capable of revealing the patient\u2019s identity, which should always be avoided. [\u2026] The sanctity of the person should never be violated save as a matter of necessity. This is no new dictum. The medical profession has always recognized and endorsed it, but thoughtlessness now and then allows the camera to beguile an individual into its infraction\u2019 (Medicus, 1894).[8] Medical illustrators had gone \u2018photo-mad\u2019 (Keiller, 1894) and fear mounted that the circulation of medical photographs would stretch beyond the educated eye of the professional. Surely, no patient wanted to become a celebrity: \u2018The normal man and the normal woman shun the notoriety that comes from public exposure of the person, and nobody has the right to thrust such notoriety upon them\u2019 (Editorial, 1894). Where does this leave the re-appropriation of these photographs in a contemporary museum? I will elaborate on this further on. \u00a0The discussion on the boundaries of medical photography at the end of the nineteenth century coincided with new concerns about privacy. In a ground-breaking article on the right to privacy in the Harvard Law Review (1890) two American lawyers pointed to the right of the individual \u2018to be let alone\u2019 (Warren &amp; Brandeis, 1984, pp 75\u2013103). According to lawyers Warren and Brandeis, the new urge to define the boundaries between public and private was prompted by the dangerous invasions of new inventions and methods:\nInstantaneous photographs and newspaper enterprise have invaded the sacred precincts of private and domestic life. [\u2026] For years there has been a feeling that the law must afford some remedy for the unauthorised circulation of portraits of private persons; and the evil of the invasion of privacy by the newspapers, long keenly felt, has been but recently discussed by an able writer (Warren &amp; Brandeis, 1984, p 76).\nThe publication heralded a significant early connection between the emergence and dissemination of instant photographs and the right to privacy. The ability of people to make photographs anywhere, at any time, and of anybody, was accompanied by the possibility that photographs might be circulated among a wide audience. The similarities between discussions on privacy and clinical photography at the time \u2013 and even today \u2013 are striking. To some extent, standardisation of medical photography practices followed from the first steps towards specialisation that were taken in the early twentieth century. Many hospitals were equipped with their own photographic studios and specialists in medical photography. A first handbook on the subject appeared in 1893 and soon the convention of a plain \u2018neutral\u2019 backdrop, typical positioning and anonymization of patients followed.\nCases where a mask, a cloth, glasses or any other device was used to mask the identity of the patient increased around 1900. Yet in many smaller institutions, conventions were local, ad-hoc and less clear cut. Museums and archives here and now are filled with collections similar to the amateur images from the tuberculosis hospital. Clinical collections dating from before the 1950s mostly lack any current day standards of close-up, structural anonymization, let alone practices of informed consent. Although when it comes to informed consent we cannot be sure in most cases. Some research suggests that in a few documented cases physicians did seek permission for publication of the patient\u2019s photographic materials. But especially with patients from a low status background, consent was most likely not actively sought at all. Conventions in pictures like those of patient P seem limited, apart from the black cloths occasionally used to create a uniform backdrop. While the lack of conventions on the one hand add to the beauty and intriguing aspects of the images, they also cause us to shift away from the original purpose of the photograph: a clinical medical record. In clinical photography, power plays an important role. The anonymization of patients in the late nineteenth century does indicate awareness for the protection of the patient\u2019s identity. By covering the face of the patient, the physicians and photographers attempt to regain control over the unruly framing of the image by the spectator. The necessity for protection does not only seem to differ with the social background of the patient, but also with the exposure of a particular affected area. Here (images below), in the hospital of the Dutch colony Surinam, photographs were taken on the spot without a proper studio. Mark the different framing of the male patient with elephantiasis of the scrotum and the depiction of two women with swollen legs, due to elephantiasis, accompanied by a nun nurse. Reasons for these differences in anonymisation possibly depended on race and the area of the body affected.\nAnonymized pictures tell us about viewing practices, about the lack of control over what it means to others wherever or whenever they see these pictures. It testifies to the tension in clinical images between the continuous shifts in meaning and political framing. Does an image of the male patient with elephantiasis appal us because it shows a sensitive body area under attack, left by \u2018primitive\u2019 medical practices to take monstrous proportions? One could also argue that the photograph demonstrates a characteristic colonial case of tropical disease at a time of emerging photographic techniques. Or, when shown side by side with a more recent mild case of the same disease the image might as well function to demonstrate our advances in medicine. Changes in framing of historical medical photographs started when images like the one of patient P were shifted away from the clinical medical gaze. In the case of patient P, this began when her image was stored after she had long left the sanatorium, collecting dust while the world around the collection of glass negatives changed profoundly. After the Second World War medical organisations and photographers\u2019 societies in the United States and Europe erected specific professional bodies concerned with medical photography. The Royal Photographic Society in the United Kingdom, for example, established a Medical Group in 1946. Within eight years after the end of the war at least seven organised medical photography departments were established in the UK alone (McFall, 2000). The first international conference for medical photography and cinematography was held in Germany in 1960 (Orbach, 1962). This conference marked a definite professionalization of medical photographers as specialists, who concerned themselves as professionals with audio-visual representation in the widest sense. Simultaneously, alongside the organisation of medical photographers was an increased awareness of patient rights. Informed consent as a principle has a history in the legal sense from the early twentieth century, with a first US landmark case about a surgical procedure in 1914 (Faden &amp; Beauchamp, 1986). The term \u2018informed consent\u2019, however, was first used in a 1957 case. Only in the 1970s did informed consent slowly become part of standard medical practice, including asking patients to consent to clinical photography. A new medical ethics emerged with a debate around authority and the doctor-patient relationship in the context of urgent societal concerns around civil rights, women\u2019s rights, the consumer movement and the rights of prisoners and the mentally ill (Faden &amp; Beauchamp, 1986, p 87). Nazi atrocities and the following Nuremberg Code formed a model and influence for debates on the autonomy and rights of patients. While confidentiality of patient information has traditionally been an integral element of medicine, the concept of \u2018medical secrecy\u2019 changed with emerging public health practices in the late nineteenth century, as Andreas-Holger Maehle has argued (Maehle, 2003; Maehle &amp; Prangofer, 2010). Yet the modern concept of confidentially in relation to authority of the patient has more prominently been framed within the 1970s and 1980s discourses of the modern patient-doctor relationship, patient rights and bioethics. This eventually culminated in our current understanding of how clinical photography \u2018evokes an invasion of privacy [\u2026] because it reveals particularities that people would rather keep hidden. Professional clinical photographers [\u2026] will not photograph a patient unless he or she has explicitly given their consent\u2019 (Berle, 2008, p 90). In the current information society, however, the wish to carefully document consent for the use of clinical photographs for teaching or publication meets ever new challenges. Research demonstrates, for example, that most patients nowadays do not feel comfortable with doctors using smart phones or other mobile devices for taking clinical photographs (Schumacher &amp; Irwin, 2010; Bryson, 2013). Historically, clinical photographic collections thus form sensitive collections in the context of medical ethics and legal thinking.[9] However, I suggest that clinical collections are not merely sensitive collections following from the developments in medical ethical frameworks, but also from new curatorial and museological thinking and practices. Medical photographs of patients had been around for a long time before ethics formally entered the museum. The ICOM Code of Professional Ethics was adopted in 1986 and revised and retitled from 2001 as ICOM Code of Ethics for Museums. Article 4.3 of the Code on exhibition of sensitive materials reads that \u2018Human remains and materials of sacred significance must be displayed in a manner consistent with professional standards and, where known, taking into account the interests and beliefs of members of the community, ethnic or religious groups from whom the objects originated. They must be presented with great tact and respect for the feelings of human dignity held by all peoples.\u2019 Post-colonial and feminist perspectives especially have clearly marked a new step in the way museums now agree to deal and interact with communities, their interests and rights.[10]How do public institutions deal with clinical photographs compared to other types of \u2018sensitive materials\u2019? Clinical photographs can be of an explicit nature, showing horrifying war-wounds, graphic pathologies, affected genital areas or patients in extreme distress. In a recent article Helen Wakely and Carly Dakin of the Wellcome Library and Wellcome Trust proposed a new approach for assessing the sensitivity of images at the Wellcome Library that are made available for research (Wakely &amp; Dakin, 2015). They discuss many aspects that would determine material as \u2018sensitive\u2019, such as sensitive content (for example, nude children, pathology, vulnerable patients, and recognisable individuals since deceased). Other aspects discussed by Wakely and Dakin are the protection of personal data and consent, as is sensitivity in a general sense: the identification of individuals in medical photographs could cause distress to the close family, for example (Wakely &amp; Dakin, 2015 p 54). In two case studies, Wakely and Dakin demonstrate the value of a resulting policy scheme and work flows for assessment of access to personal information from the Wellcome Library collections. Although a certain level of subjectivity remains present and risks of censorship increase, Wakely and Dakin conclude that high levels of subjectivity are diminished by applying the developed flowcharts (Wakely &amp; Dakin, 2015, p 60). The experiences in the Wellcome Library are important as example practice for dealing with sensitive materials in a (online) library environment. For museums, however, other factors come into play. When it comes to sensitivity, it is always a matter of defining what is perceived as sensitive to whom and in what context. Audiences or spectators, those doing the looking at the material and the processes involved, are vital. And at the same time they are the most difficult to grasp or predict. Current exhibition ethics involve value judgements and considerations about awareness of feelings in public groups.[11] This involves issues around content, human remains, objects of sacred significance, looted material and the interpretations and presentation of objects. In the case of clinical photographs this might involve questions such as: Which photographs should we display?; Are we allowed to display photographs which show nude or clearly discomforted patients?; How do we deal with patient voices?; Do we tell visitors the history behind our collections?; and, Do we instigate dialogue around patient privacy and patient representations? A museum environment frames stories and narratives in many ways. To a certain extent, museum narratives are part of the processes of remembering. The staging of clinical photographs in exhibition spaces inside museum buildings works in a different way than displaying such images online, for example. Apart from the self-evident selection of the images, enlargements (size), location and interaction with objects, text, sound or moving images are only some of the determinants for narrative building and framing.[12] Museums can thus create and activate memories of patient histories of a particular disease, of an institution, location or country, for example. Clinical photographs can be objects par excellence in recounting disease stories. But the museum, or the curator, can choose to \u2018use\u2019 the patient\u2019s photographs to tell this story or that, to stage a patient as sufferer or survivor, as victim or as example of medicine\u2019s great victory over disease. As Susan Sontag tells us in her book Regarding the Pain of Others: \u2018All photographs wait to be explained or falsified by their captions\u2019 and \u2018The photographer\u2019s intentions do not determine the meaning of the photograph, which will have its own career, blown by the whims and loyalties of the diverse communities that have use for it\u2019 (Sontag, 2003). As Elizabeth Edwards argued, through their collection practices, photographs have a \u2018life as social entities, becoming historically specific statements and cultural objects in their own right\u2019 (Edwards &amp; Mead, eds, 2015).Museums can offer things that other places cannot. I would argue that a museum can be a platform for debate to serve public interests and communities and at the same time stage the images in such a way as to respect the rights of past, deceased patients. Concern for privacy is only one historically rooted issue for exhibiting, but what about the social responsibilities of museums? Museums harbour \u2018memory workers\u2019 that can \u2018kindle social aspirations like empathy, identification, cross-cultural dialogue, to recognize multiple perspectives, or to catalyse action\u2019, as stated in Curating difficult knowledge (Lehrer, Milton &amp; Patterson, 2011). As far as medical history is concerned, museums may thus reshape public consciousness of medical practices then and now, urging us to rethink the position of (marginalised) patients, children, women, workers, prostitutes, colonial subjects, or any other \u2018victimised\u2019 community in society. But the new critical museology moves even further, calling for democratisation of access and authority (Lehrer, Milton &amp; Patterson, 2011, p 5). Innovative curatorial practices around \u2018difficult knowledge\u2019 of violence and oppression involve ways of representing the interests and voices of communities in museums or for audiences to consider the ethics of representation and exhibition itself. Although clinical photographs may not fit the category \u2018difficult knowledge\u2019 perfectly, these innovative curatorial practices could form a starting point for new paths of curating these collections.The power of photographs is their performative \u2018work\u2019 in museums. However, as Elizabeth Edwards and Matt Mead have argued, photographs \u2018rank low in the hierarchies of museum objects\u2019 and are often marginalised and undervalued in museum practice (Edwards &amp; Mead, 2013). They show how, for colonial photography, its invisibility in museums was both a symptom of and metaphor for the \u2018invisibility\u2019 of the colonial past (Edwards &amp; Mead, 2013, p 33). Suzannah Biernoff similarly discusses in a convincing way the performative power photographs can play (Biernoff, 2011). She studied graphic case photographs from First World War archives which were used in a computer game called BioShock and showed how \u2018the photographs question the limits and propriety of spectatorship\u2019 (Biernoff, 2011, p 326). In another article in Photographies, Biernoff wonders whether there are \u2018ethical considerations raised by their [the photographs\u2019] redeployment or appropriation within the context of art and entertainment, education and academic research?\u2019 (Biernoff, 2012). A museum ideally moves beyond these realms and can act as a \u2018moral agent\u2019, as stated in the preface to the 2011 Routledge Companion to Museum Ethics: \u2018Museum ethics is more than the personal and professional ethics of individuals and concerns the capacity of institutions to generate self-reflective and activist practice\u2019 (Marstine, 2011, xxiii). Yet the performative work done by photographs in museums is not easy to control. How could I as a curator stage clinical photographs in such a way as not to fall into the semiotic energy and power relation of these specific images? The difficulty for curating lies in dealing with the \u2018realist insistence of the photographic image\u2019 and to stage them in an exhibition narrative \u2013 a \u2018controlled reading\u2019 \u2013 where the photographs become integral to knowledge making (Edwards &amp; Mead, 2013, p 33). The relationship between exposing and exhibiting clinical photographs is my main concern here. Historian Jan Nicholas in her paper on the study of freakery asks herself the question whether historians have an ethical duty to the dead and if she should protect her historical subjects against voyeuristic gazes or tell their story instead (Nicholas, 2014). She eventually opts for a middle way, allowing for a \u2018respectful politics of looking \u2013 and of framing ourselves as modest witnesses\u2019 (Nicholas, 2014, p 155). Similar to scholars, curators of clinical collections, I argue, would have to take comparable complexities into account. Clinical images can be made more integral to the narrative in medical or science museums, to take the layered meanings of clinical photographs as personal yet institutional documents into account and also reflect on witnessing practices in museums. For most of us become patients at some point in time. We currently live in a time of growing interest in and worries about privacy. A 2015 Science special entitled \u2018The end of privacy\u2019 marks our concerns with the use or abuse of personal data. In this context, discussions on curating clinical photographic collections can enrich ongoing debates, museological practices and visitors alike. Clinical imagery and concerns about data protection seen as mutual historically situated issues can deepen our understanding of privacy protection. But there is no universally applicable answer or solution for how to display clinical imagery. I have argued that an awareness of the material as complex and sensitive but similarly worthwhile of exhibiting can go together. Following current museum ethics, informed decisions about display in exhibitions that shun sensationalism, morbid curiosity, or commodification of clinical photographs are important. Curating means to deal with the \u2018burden\u2019 of care and obligations to share as well. Considering the clinical photographic collections in the Boerhaave Museum, I decided not to keep the images away from audiences,[13] but to take ethical and privacy issues into consideration. This has led, for example, to the Museum Boerhaave not displaying some very explicit clinical photographs of naked children in vulnerable positions in our online database. For those interested, the images are still available for research or other uses. A similar attentiveness applies to this very (online) article, and the thought given to the kinds of images to show.Ethical questions bring arguments, good and bad, to the surface. There are no moral absolutes when it comes to the exhibition of sensitive materials. Neither does curating end with display in a museum or gallery; care for the images is a continuous process, continuously asking for reflection. Clinical or other medical images can lead their own virtual lives. Also, some patients indicate when asked that they do want their material to be open for others to see and learn from, but that would fit within our current frame of \u2018informed consent\u2019 (Onion, 2014). \u00a0Depending on their mission, each institution may choose different paths of public access to historical patient photography. Historian Michael Sappol of the US National Library of Medicine contentiously argued for open online access to historical medical imagery without regulation: \u2018We are stewards of these historical materials. [\u2026] They don\u2019t belong to us. They belong to everybody. [\u2026] I would not like to act on behalf of the subjects and arrogate to myself the job of being some kind of policeman of \u201cwho can view\u201d\u2019 (Onion, 2014). This position represents one extreme end of the spectrum. There are many different solutions between free access, partial access or limited access. As suggested in the approach by the Wellcome Library, these definitions in turn involve interpretive decisions informed by ethical principles. Museums and curators are creative in dealing with \u2018difficult\u2019 knowledge. New ways of memory curation and activation are explored in a search for audience participation. The participatory process itself can even become part of the exhibition experience. In the case of clinical photographs this could imply including a search for family or relatives, or results of focus group discussions with patients suffering from similar conditions. A wonderful example in this respect is the project The Children of Craig-y-nos, a public and oral history project of life in a Welsh tuberculosis sanatorium (1922\u20131959) by Ann Shaw and Carole Reeves (Shaw &amp; Reeves, 2009). This project included three photographic exhibitions of images collected by ex-patients and staff. Another example where patient involvement dominated was the exhibition Rather Seen Than Looked At in the Boerhaave Museum in 2007\u20132008, which displayed large photographic images of patients with skin diseases who \u2018looked back\u2019 at the spectator (see image below).[14] The patients in the photographic portraits granted permission to look at them as an audience, not as a voyeur in the street turning one\u2019s head inadvertently, but straight into their eyes, concentrated. The colour photographs were enlarged and printed together with written personal life stories beneath the images. This combination resulted in close and personal encounters between the public and the represented patient.\nA recent and very appropriate exhibition in the context of ethical considerations around historical patient photography is the 2015 exhibition The Kiss of Light: Nursing and Light Therapy in 20th-century Britain at the Florence Nightingale Museum in London. As the director of the Museum explained, staff struggled with the public display of patient photographs, in this case mostly photographs of children:[15] \u2018To our modern eyes, the exposure of children\u2019s skin to intense ultra-violet light makes us feel uneasy, as does the photographs of children often wearing little else apart from large goggles to protect their eyes from the rays. The exhibition curator and the museum team have endeavoured to display these images in a sensitive but thought-provoking way.\u2019[16] Such a thoughtful consideration of the sensitivity of the material on display could, in my view, serve as an example of best practice for dealing with historical patient photography. The awareness of the ethical issues involved bear witness to a present day professional self-reflexive attitude and sensitivity to the public in exhibition work.Museums can matter. Exhibiting or disclosing medical or, more particular, clinical photographs in public spaces may offer spectators an opportunity to bear witness to traumatic, painful or difficult histories. For curators this is a complex and affective challenge, but one that may enrich engagement with medical heritage, histories and understanding of human suffering. If not for giving others opportunities to contemplate, learn, share, remember or witness past suffering and cures, then to involve all communities and audiences in what it takes to deal with glass patients like girl P."},

According to Tyndall, many spiritualists allegedly resented scientific researchers because of their so-called unwillingness \u2018to apply to the \u201cphenomena\u201d those methods of enquiry which are found available in dealing with natural truths\u2019 (Tyndall, 1871). Instead of affording spiritualists a fair hearing, with full consideration of the apparent evidence, scientific researchers tended to refute spiritualist claims by basing their rejections on mainly a priori assumptions. Thus, opposition to spiritualism was largely unempirical and injudicious; or at least that was how Tyndall characterised the spiritualist perspective. Tyndall rose to the challenge, however, and attended a s\u00e9ance to test the veracity of the spirit hypothesis \u2013 i.e. the idea that the phenomena produced by mediums at s\u00e9ances were the result of disembodied, intelligent spirits. Tyndall professed to have carefully observed a range of phenomena, engaged in critical conversation with the spiritualists attending the event, and subjected his findings to the so-called interpretive gaze of scientific naturalism. And yet despite immersing himself in a spiritualist performance, none of the manifestations that he witnessed convinced him of the legitimacy of spirit and psychic forces. Modern spiritualism had been weighed and measured, and it was still found wanting.\nWe should be careful when reading Tyndall\u2019s account, not to be swept up in the rhetoric of the narrative. After all, like any account, Tyndall\u2019s investigation into spiritualism should be carefully deconstructed. His narrative of the event was written with the aim of denouncing occultic belief, and framing spiritualists as antagonists of modern science was all part of his rhetorical strategy for discrediting the movement. His account, though, is still a fascinating example of Victorian science\u2019s complex and uneasy relationship with spirit and psychic phenomena. Why, for instance, did a leading scientific figure such as Tyndall devote so much space to spiritualism in his book if it was nothing more than the product of superstition and credulity? The answer is simple: because spiritualism played an important role in shaping the boundaries of modern scientific knowledge and belief. Thus, it could not be ignored, and required thoughtful consideration.\nIn his new book, Physics and Psychics (2019), Richard Noakes explores one aspect of this complicated history, by analysing the connection between the physical sciences and psychical research in Britain between 1870 and 1930; a period often regarded as the \u2018golden age\u2019 of the modern spiritualist movement. His core argument is this: that psychic phenomena occupied a significant place in late-nineteenth and early twentieth-century physical sciences and that the interaction between science and supposed psychic phenomena stimulated important transformations in physical theories and experimental practices. It is a sensitive and historically-informed book that in some respects offers a nuanced corrective to the seminal but somewhat whiggish work of Janet Oppenheim, The Other World (1985). Moreover, because this was a period of immense disciplinary development and professionalisation, Noakes looks at a broad range of historical actors, from amateur enthusiasts to elite practitioners. Therefore, the book covers an impressive breadth of topics and figures, with a notable degree of detail.\nNoakes\u2019 book is a much-anticipated contribution to the historiography, having arisen out of his original doctoral research from the late 1990s. Although he has published extensively on the topic over the past two decades, this book synthesises these earlier publications and brings to light new and significant information on the historical relationship between the physical sciences and psychical research. The book is divided into six chapters, starting with an analysis of animal magnetism at the start of the nineteenth century, all the way through to the development of psychical laboratories during the opening decades of the twentieth century. Many well-known Victorian scientific and medical figures appear throughout the chapters. For example, Michael Faraday (1791\u20131867), John Elliotson (1791\u20131868), William Benjamin Carpenter (1813\u20131885), William Huggins (1824\u20131910), James Clerke Maxwell (1831\u20131879), William Fletcher Barrett (1844\u20131925), and Oliver Lodge (1851\u20131940) are examined, and their engagement with spiritualism further demonstrates just how significant psychical research was for the development of the physical sciences during the modern period.\u00a0\nThe book is also beautifully illustrated, highlighting the visual spectacle that was essential to all spiritualist performances. Some examples include a woodcut illustration depicting a late Victorian s\u00e9ance from Frank Leslie\u2019s Illustrated Newspaper in 1887; a \u2018double photograph\u2019 featuring the chemist William Crookes (1832\u20131919) and the medium Florence Cook (1856\u20131904) on one side of the image, and Crookes and the supposed physical materialisation of the spirit Katie King on the other side; and a scientific diagram of Crookes\u2019 \u2018phonautograph\u2019 from 1871, which was an automated machine for registering psychic forces (Noakes, 2019). It is also commendable, how Noakes is trying to establish \u2018alternative science\u2019 as an important and central field of study for the history of science broadly conceived. As he rightly contends, for much of the discipline\u2019s past, books on psychical research and spiritualism have tended to be framed as peripheral studies of pseudo-scientific topics. Yet, as Physics and Psychics demonstrates, the physical sciences\u2019 engagement with mediumship cut to the very core of what it meant to theorise and practice fields as diverse as chemistry, physics, physiology and psychology, to name a few.\nLike any book, however, Physics and Psychics has its limitations. Noakes\u2019 often hyper-focused analysis of physical scientists\u2019 interaction with psychical research has the propensity to obscure the larger picture of Victorian science, which can lead to some interpretative issues. A good example is Noakes\u2019 portrayal of scientific naturalism, in which he conflates the X-Club\u2019s version as the sole definition of the paradigm. Yet as more recent works such as Victorian Scientific Naturalism has shown, the concept was far more complicated (Dawson\u00a0and Lightman, 2014). For example, figures such as Alfred Russel Wallace (1823\u20131913), who was the co-discoverer of evolution by natural selection, diverged considerably from the more hard-lined verificationist assumptions of researchers such as the biologist Thomas Henry Huxley (1825\u20131895). That does not mean that Wallace was not a scientific naturalist. He still attempted to explain spirit and psychic forces by identifying the natural laws that governed them. [1] These criticisms aside, though, Noakes has written an important book that will quickly become staple reading for anyone interested in science and occultism and the making of modern science broadly construed."},

Sometimes at the front on the imprint or colophon page of the book. This is traditionally the title page verso (p iv, also variously called the copyright or biblio page) and contains the essential printing and publication history of the work.[2] Here amongst the copyright and cataloguing information, a publisher may choose to include details of the design and production of the book, including the name and size of the typeface used and the name and location of one of the now fast-disappearing trade typesetting firms. Sometimes the information about the typeface used in a given publication is to be found at the back of the book, increasingly as something of a feature on its own (see Figure 1). Indeed, such has been the proliferation of these \u2018notes on the type\u2019, that they have become a focus for pastiche, targeted by both the Paris Review (Russell, 1981) and the New Yorker (McCall, 1997), and even informing a fiction of their own in Jonathan Safran Foer\u2019s \u2018About the typefaces not used in this edition\u2019 (2007). However, there is more to the inclusion of these small notes of typographic commentary in our mass-produced books than their comedic potential might suggest and an examination of the origins of this practice alerts us to potential significations beyond the immediate note to which our attention is called.\nIt is a practice that has been attributed to the working collaboration between the publisher Alfred A Knopf and the designer William A Dwiggins established in the USA during the second quarter of the twentieth century. The typographic historian Paul Shaw (2016) traces the first example of the dedicated typographic colophon to the 1927 Knopf publication of Willa Cather\u2019s Death comes to the Archbishop. He (Shaw, 1984, p 30) notes that, \u2018The colophon, headed \u201cA note on the Type in Which this Book is Set,\u201d was a device adapted at Dwiggins\u2019s instigation from private press books, as a means of calling the reading public\u2019s attention to a book\u2019s design and manufacturing background. Initially ridiculed by other trade publishers as an affectation, it has since been copied to varying degrees by many of them.\u2019\u00a0"},

After several hundred years of development, the instrument trade was extremely diversified. Few manufacturers produced only experimental instruments for scientists. This range of different markets was exploited to sustain consistent profits through separate income streams. It was natural that skilled lens-grinders, as the optical instrument makers were, would turn their hand to any instrument that could be assembled using their skill-set, regardless of its field or application. If we consult the trade cards for different manufacturers we see a plethora of different instruments and devices. John Cuff of Fleet Street (see Figure 1) advertises reading glasses, refracting and reflecting telescopes, several different microscopes, barometers, thermometers and speaking trumpets. John Bennet of Crown Court (see Figure 2) advertises microscopes, telescopes, rules, globes, sundials, theodolites and compasses, among a jumble of other instruments. Nathaniel Hill of Chancery Lane (see Figure 3) advertises a similar range of professional and analytical instruments and announces that he \u2018makes and sells all sorts of mathematical instruments in silver, ivory and wood, very curious and true graduated for sea or land, with books for their use and the best black-lead pencils\u2019. Many of the items on offer would have been bought in for retail, but each maker would also have maximised their own manufacturing skills to produce all kinds of different instruments.\nBut these markets were not stable. At different times the relative importance of each would rise and fall and manufacturers would react through specialisation. Occasionally, a large precision contract would become available and several makers would scramble to claim the work. John Bird produced a large set of astronomical instruments for the Radcliffe Observatory in 1771 (Morrison-Low, 2007, p 137), and Troughton and Simms held a long relationship with the Royal Observatory throughout the nineteenth century, supplying precision equipment, making repairs and developing new instruments (McConnel, 1992, p 39). These periodic associations were important, but quite rare. Only the best-regarded makers could secure a prestigious contract with a professional scientific institution. Towards the end of the century professional navigational and measuring instruments became increasingly important with the expansion of trade and manufacture in the industrial revolution (Morrison-Low, 2007, pp 258\u2013267; Bryden, 1972, pp 10\u201315). Similarly, an expanding market for luxury goods encouraged instrument makers to sell increasing numbers of off-the-shelf objects, intended for novelty rather than experimental use (Morrison-Low, 2007, pp 271\u2013274). By the turn of the nineteenth century relatively few instruments were being sold to scientists. The majority of consumers were part of these other markets.In the later years of the eighteenth century the market for consumer instruments was rapidly expanding. Scientific instruments were increasingly sold as consumer objects, as Berg suggests, \u2018ornaments of consumption as much as they were tools of engineering\u2019 (1998, p 154). Scholars have described this age of expanding luxury retail as a consumer revolution (Berg, 2004; 2005). This continues into the nineteenth century. Consumption increased because of greater wealth circulation, but this is only secondarily related to the industrial revolution. As Dorothy Davis identifies, retail was driven by industrial manufacture only from the second half of the nineteenth century (1966, p 252). In the early years consumer retail remained much as it had in the eighteenth century \u2013 slowly expanding due to greater affluence in the middle classes, but mostly unaffected by industrial production. Instrument manufacture, even for the larger domestic market, remained largely artisanal in organisation. There was no industrial production of instruments, but the trade became gradually more integrated into the workshop economy that had driven the early expansion in fancy goods. The first popular media devices took advantage of a longstanding network of manufacturing workshops to efficiently produce larger volumes of popular instruments. This is one reason for part of the trade\u2019s successful shift into popular optics; even before true mass-production factory methods were applied.Earlier makers had long produced instruments for ostensibly entertainment purposes; both the Hill and Bennett trade cards include a magic lantern and camera obscura among their wares, while the Cuff trade card advertises: \u2018THE CAMERA OBSCURA for exhibiting Prospects in their natural Proportions and Colours, together with the Motions of living subjects: MAGIC LANTHORNS; Convex and Concave SPECULUMS or Looking Glasses, MULTIPLYING GLASSES, [\u2026] and many other curiosities.\u2019 There had always been instruments sold for novelty consumption. What changed in the nineteenth century was the approach to retailing curiosities.\u00a0"},

Between 22 May and 25 June, Britons were invited to vote for one of six shortlisted challenges to be the focus of a \u00a310m prize fund. Speaking at the BBC\u2019s Broadcasting House, Astronomer Royal Lord Martin Rees explained that zero-carbon flight, global malnourishment, antibiotic resistance, paralysis, clean water and dementia were six among \u2018many broad societal problems demanding fresh thinking\u2019.[1]\u00a0 Members of the new Longitude Committee encouraged the public to \u2018surprise us!\u2019 with innovative ideas; Professor Brian Cox stressed that \u2018it\u2019s open to everyone, not only scientists but [also] the inventor in their garden shed\u2019.[2]\nAlongside the excitement, the Prize perhaps inevitably aroused criticism, with commentators complaining that it was inappropriate and in bad taste for the ill-informed public to choose between six areas which all deserved investigation.[3]\u00a0 It was also noted that the scale of the technical challenges and the cost of modern scientific investigation made it unlikely that a \u2018lone genius\u2019 could scoop the prize; Cox\u2019s broad grin as he said \u2018I kind of hope an inventor in their garden shed wins it\u2019 suggested he didn\u2019t really believe it was possible.[4]\u00a0 But if John Harrison, an eccentric northern clockmaker, had apparently managed just that in the eighteenth century, perhaps the same could happen today. Still, online commentators predicted an Establishment stitch-up, as had supposedly happened for decades to Harrison despite his having found the solution that had eluded the great Isaac Newton.[5]\nAlthough the real, and perhaps more realistic, purpose of the twenty-first-century Prize seems to be to enthuse the public about science, the invocation of John Harrison as an outsider capable of a telling contribution on a pressing issue, handsomely (if belatedly) rewarded for his achievements, has been at the centre of its public relations profile. Yet the debate around the 2014 Prize highlights both the differences between now and 300 years ago, and the complexities of an apparently simple history. These are brought out in the National Maritime Museum\u2019s Ships, Clocks &amp; Stars exhibition, as well as in the official publication of the same name.[6]\u00a0 Although the Museum has been willingly involved in the promotion of the new Longitude Prize, dedicating the exhibition\u2019s final wall to the current challenges and providing historical blurb for the Prize\u2019s PR, Ships, Clocks &amp; Stars is determined to present a more nuanced account of why longitude was important and how the problem was solved.\nIt would be vastly over-simplifying this captivating and multi-layered exhibition to describe it as \u2018myth-busting\u2019, but it is undoubtedly true that it, and the five-year AHRC-funded research project behind it, sit in the shadow of Dava Sobel\u2019s 1995 blockbuster Longitude: The True Story of a Lone Genius Who Solved the Greatest Scientific Problem of His Time. Sobel\u2019s book cast John Harrison as a misunderstood hero battling against the odds and an establishment led by the nefarious Astronomer Royal Nevil Maskelyne; the project blog\u2019s annotated bibliography acidly remarks that the \u2018enormous popularity\u2019 of this \u2018succinct book for a popular audience...has given the Sobel account great currency\u2019.[7]\u00a0 Of course the project and exhibition were never going to endorse the misconception that Harrison\u2019s reliable chronometers were the only possible solution to the problem of finding longitude at sea. In fact, one of the results of the research project, which has digitised the archives of the Board of Longitude and other related papers,[8]\u00a0 has been to bring to light the great variety of solutions proposed and considered. The exhibition dedicates space to explaining their details and development. Five are presented as serious contenders: timekeepers; Jupiter\u2019s moons; lunar distances; signalling; and magnetism. The first four had been described by Newton in a report to the Admiralty in 1714, a document\u00a0 which is held in the Cambridge Digital Library \u2013 it is a great strength of the official publication that its footnotes provide precise web addresses allowing readers to access the original documents directly.[9]\u00a0 Newton\u2019s succinct summary mentions each of the methods alongside its then drawback: a watch could keep the time of a reference location, to compare with local time found astronomically, but such an instrument had not yet been made sufficiently accurate to withstand the vicissitudes of marine travel; a reference time could alternatively be provided via observation of the predictable eclipses of Jupiter\u2019s moons, but such fine telescopic observation was currently impossible on a moving ship; or the Moon\u2019s position against the background of stars could provide the reference time, but her motions were as yet insufficiently understood to provide positions accurate to better than two or three degrees of longitude; or vessels anchored at known locations could fire signals at set times, but deep oceanic waters made that unfeasible. The fifth method took advantage of changes in magnetic variation (the difference between true and magnetic north) across the globe, but such differences were small and changed with time.\nThe exhibition presents each of these methods alongside their original proponents, explaining them succinctly before narrowing them down to the two eventual front runners: the timekeepers and the lunar-distance method. Importantly, though, as the methods are narrowed, the cast of characters is widened: we learn how Christiaan Huygens, the first advocate of a horological solution, was succeeded by Harrison and George Graham (whose financial support and advocacy in London was crucial for the Lincolnshire-based Harrison), while in the task of observing, cataloguing and computing the Moon\u2019s motions John Flamsteed was joined by Maskelyne and the Hanoverian cartographer Tobias Mayer. Meanwhile accurate astronomy at sea was facilitated by better instruments, invented by John Hadley among others. Visitors to the exhibition have the valuable opportunity to handle a sextant and octant, but their use could perhaps have been explained more thoroughly; it could also have been made clearer that such instruments were necessary in both methods, since local time always needed to be found as accurately as possible. But Hadley\u2019s octant and the sextants that later incorporated Hadley\u2019s innovations were particularly useful for the precise measurements required in the lunar-distance method, and in any case it is hardly surprising that the NMM curators chose to place them on the right hand side of the gallery, where they help Mayer\u2019s maps and Maskelyne\u2019s tables to stand a chance of attracting attention away from Harrison\u2019s shiny clocks.\nIt is rare for all five of Harrison\u2019s timepieces to be brought together in a single exhibition, but this is just one of the achievements of the curators. The Longitude Act itself, given royal assent three hundred years and two days before this exhibition opened, is displayed to the public for the first time here.\nIts loan (from the Parliamentary Archives) is one of many from public and private collections in this country and abroad; fascinating draft treatises and astronomical notebooks full of scribbled calculations are set off by artwork painted and objects collected on Captain Cook\u2019s expeditions, as well as Maskelyne\u2019s wonderful observing suit, \u2018padded in all the right places\u2019 according to its exhibition label.\nThese objects are put to excellent use in describing the science as well as its cultural context, the impact of longitude on both exploration and life at home. I was lucky to be shown around by Katy Barrett, Royal Museums Greenwich\u2019s Curator of Art pre-1800, and her tour highlighted how longitude captured the public imagination to an extent beyond the dreams of the 2014 Longitude Prize\u2019s public relations team (despite the modern media at their disposal). One room in the exhibition is dedicated to the coffee-house culture in which the longitude problem and the array of practicable and preposterous proposals were discussed. The plastazote \u2018coffee\u2019 is not very convincing, but the sound of re-enacted discussions and the room\u2019s decoration incorporating contemporary cartoons effectively re-creates the atmosphere of excitement around the problem. Visitors can readily understand how the crackpot schemes satirised in Hogarth\u2019s A Rake\u2019s Progress (displayed here in authentic and pirated versions) came about.\nOf course it was the Board of Longitude\u2019s task to sort the crackpot from the credible.\u00a0 Despite being named in the original Act, the Commissioners came together for the first time only in 1737, and would not be called a Board until the 1760s. But from then on they met with increasing regularity and bureaucratisation, initially to discuss possible solutions and later, after Harrison\u2019s designs were successfully copied and economised and after astronomical work had brought about the Nautical Almanac that greatly simplified the computation of lunar distances, to support methodological refinements and improvements in the production and maintenance of instruments. In this exhibition the Board\u2019s work is conveyed through the re-enactment of a 1765 meeting discussing the results of tests carried out on transatlantic voyages over the previous two years. One might complain that it is unclear how much of the entertaining recording was scripted according to the Board\u2019s minutes and how much from the curators\u2019 imagination; the minutes are in fact quite detailed, but it is hard to know how dispassionately the commissioners were able to discuss the lunar-distance method given that its principal advocate Nevil Maskelyne was now one of their number.[10]\u00a0 (One wonders, too, to what extent they were swayed by the intellectual appeal of an astronomical solution over the artisan technicality of timekeepers.) Nevertheless, the combination of broadcast discussion with projected images of the projects and information about the speakers is highly effective.\nOf course, even once the Board had agreed that both the chronometric and lunar-distance methods had been proved workable, the considerable task of development still lay ahead. Much of the exhibition (and more than half of the accompanying publication) is dedicated to this development process, in which the \u2018public/private partnership\u2019 Lord Rees evokes in his foreword to the publication was paramount. On the astronomical side, the exhibition explores the work of the cottage industry that evolved to produce the Nautical Almanac, with teams of observers and human computers notably including some women. This teamwork was counterbalanced by exploration of the potential for mechanisation in the production of instruments and computation of tables, embodied in the exhibition by Jesse Ramsden\u2019s dividing engine, which marked out fractions of degrees on a circle with unprecedented accuracy, and by the difference engine and logarithmic tables of Charles Babbage. In the latter, Babbage experimented with every conceivable colour of ink and paper to find the ideal combination to minimise misreading; he even tried black on black, evidence either of extreme thoroughness or of longitude\u2019s capacity to bring out the crackpot. On the chronometric side, we see the reproduction and simplification of Harrison\u2019s designs by watchmakers such as Thomas Mudge, John Arnold and Thomas Earnshaw. Arnold\u2019s and Earnshaw\u2019s large-scale production allowed more than 2,000 marine chronometers to be built in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century. This compared with just a few hundred in France, numbers that make it unsurprising that Britain led the way in exploration of the North and South Pacific.\nThe voyages of Cook and George Vancouver, the search for the Northwest Passage, the charting of Africa... it is easy to see why the longitude problem and its solution captured the public imagination. And although the 2014 Longitude Prize is, as Brian Cox put it, \u2018more about stimulating the conversation, stimulating the ideas\u2019, it is hard to imagine the issue of antibiotic resistance, notwithstanding its importance and its winning of the public vote, doing the same this century. The featureless, ever-changing seascape that first greets visitors to Ships, Clocks &amp; Stars, the pitiless sea that for centuries had led to lost ships and lives and more recently to lost (and delayed) trade, presented a clear problem in need of a technical solution. This is the scientific and cultural story presented with admirable clarity and accessibility in the National Maritime Museum\u2019s enthralling new exhibition.\n\u00a0\nThe exhibition Ships, Clocks &amp; Stars: The Quest for Longitude is on show at the National Maritime Museum from 11 July 2014 to 4 January 2015. The exhibition is curated by Richard Dunn and Rebekah Higgitt and is one of the results of a five-year AHRC-funded research partnership between the National Maritime Museum and Cambridge University.

Yet they are also dynamic institutions, participating in and responding to contemporary intellectual and social contexts. Museums\u2019 funders, visitors and political patrons link their ideas and actions to narratives about the past, present and future, which are part of the intellectual and cultural life of the times. Such engagement with the life of the country has shaped the categories that museums employ and the selection of the artefacts they display (Bud, 1995).\nThe Science Museum was born out of the huge Loan Collection of Scientific Apparatus exhibited in South Kensington from May to December 1876. This was a major cultural event that was widely reviewed at the time ('The Press on the Loan Collection', 1876). It presented a greater number of artefacts relating to science (20,000) than are displayed today by the entire Science Museum or the Deutsches Museum, and it attracted more than a quarter of a million visitors. The permanent exhibition that followed on the west side of Exhibition Road was formally entitled the 'Science Museum' in 1885. Several historians have reflected upon the administrative challenges the Loan Collection faced and on its contents and publication (de Clercq, 2002a, 2002b, 2002c, 2003; Cho, 2001). Here I want to show how the process of creating both the Loan exhibition and the permanent exhibition demonstrated to the leaders of British science and to the Government's Science and Art Department the power of the exhibition as a means of engaging with the stories about the past and future of science that were widely circulating in society.\nHistorians inevitably bring the sensibilities of the present to their interpretation of the past. Our experience of the 21st century can sensitise us to real historical issues that we might otherwise overlook. Today we are well aware of the challenges faced by public institutions, and perhaps particularly scientific ones. They operate in a difficult economic and political climate and have to engage not just with leading individuals but with influential interest groups, demanding funders and a raucous press. Examining the place of the museum as a story-teller negotiating many competing forms of rhetoric, with impacts on large numbers of people, may provide a fertile approach to examining how culture, society and science evolve together (Bud, 2013).\nThe first story addressed by the Loans exhibition celebrated science as a vigorous and increasingly significant international culture and profession, perhaps younger than the visual arts but with a glorious history of its own. After the opening of the exhibition by Queen Victoria, The Times commented, 'The world of arts and of letters had advanced far long before science was considered to be anything more than a craze, more or less harmless. The natural consequence has been that at the present day governors and governed alike know more about, and take much more interest in, art and literature, and collections representing them, than about science.' The promoters of the exhibition found distinguished proponents of this account from many countries, including scientists such as Britain's Thomas Huxley and Germany\u2019s August von Hofmann, and rulers in Germany, France, Russia and America.\nThe second story was profoundly national, describing science as a weapon against the threat of decline. The national anxieties of the mid-1870s that provided the context for developing the Loan exhibition were particularly intense. By coincidence, the opening took place just a few weeks after the passing of the controversial Royal Titles Bill, which had bestowed on Victoria the title 'Empress of India'. While this title may have confirmed and assured her international hegemony, and was seen as a sign of British supremacy by many (such as Disraeli), to others the very word 'empire' was ominous. For a classically trained nation steeped in Gibbons\u2019 The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,it contained within it the potential for self-destruction (Bell, 2009, p 140). The spectre of a powerful new competitor raised by the Prussian military victory over the French in 1870 resonated with unease about faltering national commercial success. The narrative of the rescuing role of science gained ground. Schools inspector and educationalist Matthew Arnold, for example, who had reported in 1869 on Schools and Universities on the Continent, reprinted the section on Germany in 1874, using language that would be repeated frequently (echoed, for instance, a generation later when King Edward VII spoke at the opening of the new Imperial College in 1907).\n'But the idea of science and systematic knowledge is wanting to our whole instruction alike, and not only to that of our business class. While this idea is getting more and more power upon the Continent, and while its application there is leading to more and considerable results, we in England, having done marvels by the rule of thumb, are still inclined to disbelieve in the paramount importance, in whatever department, of any other. And yet in Germany every one will.' (Arnold, 1874, p 212)\nIn the year that Arnold\u2019s book was published, the Foreign Secretary, the Earl of Derby, had celebrated Britain\u2019s past success and present glory at the inaugural meeting of the Society for the Promotion of Scientific Industry (see Figure 1), but warned:\n'If we can\u2019t produce cheaply, we shall be undersold, even in our own markets; we have to compete with countries where wages are far lower than here (who can say, looking forward how those officinae gentium [workshops of the world], India, China, and Russia, may affect the labour supply of the future?), and we cannot expect that here wages will fall much, if at all, below their present rate. We are shut up, therefore, to one of two conclusions \u2013 either we must acknowledge ourselves beaten, or we must contrive to make every day\u2019s labour of a man more productive than it has been hitherto, by the more general, or by the more skilful use, of mechanical and chemical science.' (Manchester Times, 1874)\nThis narrative about averting national decline also drew upon an established idea that more technical education (variously, if at all, defined) was needed to sustain British pre-eminence. Calls for better education had flourished in the public sphere immediately after the Great Exhibition of 1851. These had led to the formation in 1853 of the Science and Art Department, whose principal activity was a national system of examinations and teaching of science and art. However, while science had been included in those mid-century moves for education, its standing was then more a matter of convenience than commitment (Bud and Roberts, 1984). Its teaching was seen as possibly useful, and not threatening of commercial secrets (a common anxiety about more specific education), but not core to the education of even an engineer.\nThus the South Kensington Museum conceived by Prince Albert, led by Henry Cole and opened in 1857 as a legacy of the Great Exhibition, was devoted largely to design. Although it would be remembered as the administrative ancestor of the Science Museum, it contained very little that related to science per se. When The Times reviewed the Museum\u2019s contents in 1859, the only reference made to science was in the treatment of the Library (South Kensington Museum, 1859). Moreover, Parliament\u2019s Select Committee, which examined the Museum shortly after its foundation, expressed neither opinions nor obligation towards science (Select Committee on the South Kensington Museum, 1860).\nAlthough such treatment might seem to us as neglect, it reflected the reality that beyond the domain of art, the South Kensington Museum included only a small and miscellaneous variety of science-related collections that had been accepted from members of the public, including the educational collection from the Society of Arts exhibition of 1854 (which did include some science artefacts), animal products, food, and building materials (Science and Art Department, 1858, pp 73-79).\nMuch more substantial than these miscellaneous legacy items were the displays of the Patent Office Museum, newly established in the large 'prefab' next door on Cromwell Road. Organised and driven by the Patent Office\u2019s energetic leader Bennett Woodcroft, this would leave the Science Museum with some of its greatest collections. Again, however, as Christine MacLeod has shown, this museum was dedicated to the memorialising of invention rather than science (MacLeod, 2007).\nTherefore, while the Great Exhibition and the establishment of the Science and Art Department were dramatic events, they did not themselves transform the position of science in public discourse. It was a decade later, at the end of the 1860s, that the narrative of science teaching as the cure for decline came to the fore. Frustrated by the marginality of science in the Science and Art Department of the 1850s, its deputy secretary \u2013 the chemist Lyon Playfair \u2013 had left for a chair in Edinburgh in 1858. However, being a politician by temperament (if not by talent), Playfair could not leave off politics. In 1867, he wrote to the head of the commission then reviewing educational policy, from the Paris Exposition. Playfair denounced the relative weakness of British presentations and blamed it on the lack of science education in Britain. A tide of public opinion and institutional movement was set underway (Gooday, 2000; Bud and Roberts, 1984). Within months a Parliamentary Select Committee, chaired by the German-born industrialist and MP Bernhard Samuelson, was sitting to investigate the parlous state of science in education. Disraeli, then Prime Minister, was supportive of moves to set up a network of science colleges, but he was unseated by a new liberal administration under Gladstone that prioritised universal elementary education. To compensate for institutional inaction and placate the powerful industrial and political pressure groups now calling for government support, the Royal Commission for Scientific Education was established in 1870. The eight reports appearing between 1871 and 1875 would be a benchmark in the State's recognition of science in Britain.\nThe president of the Commission was the newly elevated Duke of Devonshire, scion of one of the oldest ruling families in the country and a man who was making huge profits from his investments in the new Barrow steelworks. The secretary was a very different kind of man. Norman Lockyer was a War Office clerk, responsible for editing the Army Regulations, and a well-respected amateur astronomer. Lockyer had recently established Nature, then just one of the many new magazines that combined aggressively expressed opinion with original science (Meadows, 2011). An active lobbyist, he took the strategic position of converting the thoughts of his distinguished Commission into words and action.\nThe Fourth report produced by the Royal Commission dealt with museums and culture and was published in February 1874. Having looked at the provision for natural history at the British Museum and Kew, the Commission contrasted the quite inadequate representation of the physical sciences. Certainly they were not dealt with properly in the South Kensington Museum, which Lockyer would describe in testimony to an 1889 Treasury Committee as Hamlet 'with the part of the Prince of Denmark omitted' (Committee appointed by Treasury to enquire into the Science Collections at South Kensington, 1889, q 853, p 55). By contrast, the Commission was impressed with what had been achieved in neighbouring France. Norman Lockyer had been asked to report on the Paris institutions and he cited in detail developments at the Conservatoire National des Arts et M\u00e9tiers. Established early in the revolution, this had been radically modernised by its director, the engineer General Morin (Fontanon, 1990; Jacomy, 1995). Now it housed a collection designed to educate and inform, hosted lectures and contained a laboratory. An appendix to the Commission\u2019s report (of course put together by Lockyer as Secretary) included a complete catalogue of the collection in Paris. The report itself recommended that a new collection of physical and mechanical instruments be established in South Kensington and that this should be combined with the Patent Office Museum's collection.\nThe argument for a collection of scientific apparatus was expressed in terms of meeting demand. The critical paragraph of the recommendation reads: 'We consider that the recent progress in these Sciences, and the daily increasing demand for knowledge concerning them, make it desirable that the National Collections should be extended in this direction, so as to meet a great Scientific Requirement which cannot be provided for in any other way' (Royal Commission on Scientific Education, 1874, p 13). Although, therefore, the Commission had been established within the overarching context of meeting a foreign threat, the language of this particular recommendation was couched in terms of the newly emerging international culture of science. It drew upon the representation of other parts of culture.\nThe recommendation was turned into action through a combination of informally negotiated enthusiasms and formal steps. The diary of Henry Cole, the retiring head of the Science and Art Department, shows how conversations about a new exhibition of science were proceeding at a fast and furious pace even early in 1874. The following months must have seen much informal discussion about how these could provide an opportunity for scientific shows. From January 1875 onwards, a carefully choreographed series of moves to influence government can be followed in the archives. First, as appropriate, a suggestion was put formally to the Board of the South Kensington Museum by the Director, Philip Cunliffe-Owen, who proposed a loan collection for scientific apparatus, 'the exhibition to include not only modern apparatus but also apparatus interesting from the persons by whom it had been employed or the discoveries in which it had been used' (South Kensington Museum, 1875a). By mid-February 1875, a consultative meeting had been convened at the South Kensington Museum by the Lord President of the Council of Education, the Duke of Richmond (South Kensington Museum, 1874-1876, p 73).\nThe particular interests of the key individuals and emerging arguments about the nature of science had an impact in this process. Several of the distinguished participants in this inaugural meeting, including Thomas Huxley, John Tyndall and William Hooker, were members of the X-Club, brought together by their visions for professional science. Once angry young men, they were now at their peak as leaders of the scientific establishment and had the power to influence the fashioning of science. These men were closely associated with a rhetoric of science as culture, which would inevitably bring wealth as long as it were not constrained (Barton, 1990; and Barton, 2004).\nThere was a different emphasis among other participants. Whereas previously, in the Patent Office Museum, the interpretation of the development of new machines had emphasised the genius of inventions, now the development of new products was interpreted as the result of science. Sir William Siemens, who was a leader of the engineering community at the meeting, was an enthusiast for the idea of 'applied science', a term which had become fashionable in the contemporary development of new institutions for the training of men for industry. He was campaigning for the formation of a 'House of Applied Science' to accommodate all of London\u2019s engineering institutions (Siemens, 1877). In this structure objects, such as Joule\u2019s apparatus for measuring the mechanical equivalent of heat (still revered today as iconic in the history of thermodynamics), had a special significance since they linked science that was of truly international significance \u2013 but not of direct economic importance \u2013 to the process of invention. For men such as Siemens, the two narratives of British economic benefit and of the history of humanity were linked by the past and future of applied science.\nThe 1875 meeting established a first classification of what the Loan exhibition would display:\n1. mechanics (including pure and applied mathematics)\n2. physics\n3. chemistry (including metallurgy)\n4. geology, mineralogy and geography\n5. biology\nA key part of the plan of Colonel Donnelly, Director of Science in the Department of Science and Art, who was made accountable for the project, was to recruit Lockyer (who had, after all, been the main advocate of a Loans exhibition) to take responsibility for delivery (Bud, 2009). The careful dance of recruiting him was interrupted by the unexpected difficulty of persuading the Treasury to fund Lockyer to deliver the exhibition in combination with his other commitments (which included researching solar physics, and organising the educational collections). The appointment was finally made in July 1875.\nThe exhibition\u2019s inspiration and Lockyer\u2019s campaign had drawn on nationalistic anxieties, especially the concern that Britain would not be able to compete without improving its science education, and hence its productivity. However, the use of narratives is complex and flexible and it was quite possible, and even useful, for actors to draw on different stories in different situations. In implementing the exhibition, for example, Lockyer switched to the rather different narrative of the glorious culture of science. This tended to be framed in an elevated rhetoric of international endeavour for universal benefit. In line with the story of science as a creative human activity, there was no German or British section. Rather the visitor would engage with science as a coherent international endeavour.\nLockyer was thus able to draw on the close ties and professional allegiances that bound many European countries. In Berlin, the President of the German Chemical Society was August von Hofmann, who had been professor of chemistry at London\u2019s Royal College of Chemistry. He in turn was helped by the internationalism of the family of Queen Victoria. Her daughter, also called Victoria, was married to Frederick, the heir-apparent of the German empire, and was an enthusiastic supporter of the Loan exhibition. In January 1876, she summoned 40 leading German scientists who agreed to the formation of a working party chaired by Hofmann. In the event several thousand instruments were loaned by Germany, including 61 of the 432 historic scientific instruments \u2013 among these was the apparatus of Tycho Brahe. William Hooker, President of the Royal Society, proudly suggested that the exhibition had 'ransacked the scientific storehouses of Europe' (Hooker, 1876, though amended in the published version, Hooker, 1876a). The massive catalogue, which exceeded a thousand pages, was also translated into German.\nIn May 1876, the Loan exhibition opened. It was held not in the main building of the South Kensington Museum but in two of the long, thin 'arcades', one on the south of the Gardens, roughly where the Science Museum is now, and the other on the west side along Queen\u2019s Gate following a line currently at the rear of Imperial College.\nThe southern gallery, accessed from Exhibition Road, held the icons of mechanics and marine engineering such as the Rocket locomotive, Puffing Billy and the Watt collection, which were also the larger objects. These were part of a section that was now described as 'applied science', with the distinguished engineer Sir William Siemens in charge. Thus the physical transfer of the Rocket locomotive from the Patent Office Museum to the new exhibition next door (of which we have a rare photograph - see Figure 2) represented a conceptual transformation \u2013 from a product of invention to a masterpiece of science \u2013 as well as a physical relocation.\nTo separate the Loan exhibition from a trade show, prices of artefacts were not given, or were in some cases even removed, distinguishing the approach from that of the practically oriented engineer (Clercq, 2002c, p 19; Kirchner, pp 302\u201303), and showing the exhibition\u2019s alignment with the endeavour of science. However, the Director of the South Kensington Museum did respond to a special German request, and a dedicated office was set up for providing catalogues of contemporary German material with prices, which led to many enquiries.\nFrom the southern gallery, visitors were expected to progress through a narrow corridor to the second building, which held the smaller objects relating to laboratory science. There one could appreciate Galileo\u2019s telescope, Lavoisier\u2019s calorimeter and Joule\u2019s apparatus. Remarkably, only one photograph of the exhibition itself is extant, showing part of this gallery (see Figure 3).\nAs part of the campaign to render the exhibit permanent, many of the objects were copied before their return after the exhibition closed in December 1876 (de Clercq, 2003, p 13). Several hundred objects were photographed, but three-dimensional electrotype copies were also made in an eerie anticipation of the modern practice of 3-D imaging. Again, this reflected a collaborative internationalist thrust. At the international exhibition in Paris in 1867, a convention signed by a dozen princes ordained that works of art should be reproduced systematically for international distribution in the 'Convention for promoting universally Reproductions of Works of Art for the benefit of Museums of all countries' (see Figure 4).\nTwelve of the most important objects loaned to the exhibition from overseas were copied, some in multiple editions. These included Tycho Brahe\u2019s quadrant, the Magdeburg hemispheres (with which the suction of a vacuum was vividly demonstrated in Germany during the early 17th century) (see Figure 5) and Lavoisier\u2019s own calorimeter from Paris. The museum of the Conservatoire National des Arts et M\u00e9tiers also offered to exchange reproductions as soon a permanent museum had been established in London.\nThus the articulation of the narrative of an internationalist culture of science within the construction of the Loans exhibition was further fortified by the inclusion of artefacts from different countries, making it easy to overlook a nationalist agenda. The German translation of the catalogue and international acclaim for the exhibition highlight its success in expressing the values of new scientific professions. Nonetheless, there was nationalist competition at work too. Almost as soon as the Loans exhibition closed, the chemist Lyon Playfair, who had launched the technical education panic a decade earlier, raised his on-going programme of bolstering the nation through encouraging science education. This time he struck through his access to funds left over from the profitable 1851 Exhibition, looked after by a body of Commissioners (and still active in 2014). As a Commissioner himself, Playfair arranged an offer of \u00a3100,000 to the government to cover the cost of a building for a permanent collection (Scott, 1876). Several distinguished scientists scrabbled to follow up, publishing a memorial to the government, with 140 distinguished signatories. This stressed the 'importance of establishing a museum of pure and applied science: that is to say a museum containing scientific apparatus, appliances and chemical products illustrating the history and latest developments of science' and urging the assimilation of the Patent Office Museum (Museum of Science, 1876).\nDespite its initial enthusiasm, the government proved reluctant to allocate money to a permanent museum. But the situation as it stood was not sustainable. Art needed more space in the South Kensington Museum and consequently the science departments were expelled from the main Museum building on the east side of Exhibition Road. Meanwhile, the Board of Trade was keen to close the Patent Office Museum. The Devonshire Commission report had provided a justification for an alternative model and the Loan exhibition had provided the vindication (Science and Art Department, 1883, lxx). So, in the end, selected Patent Office Museum objects were transferred to the South Kensington Museum, and the Museum's Report for 1885 explained 'that these examples will be amalgamated with the Science Collections of the Department, and will in future be known as the Science Museum' (Science and Art Department, 1885, p 193).\nThrough the 1880s, battles had to be fought through a thicket of committees for the vision expressed by the Devonshire Commission report in 1874 to be realised. There was widely expressed scepticism that this was just another piece of 'jobbery' by scientists wishing to live off the state at a time when government funding of research was also being debated. A correspondent to The Times warned that a science museum might end up requiring 'a well-paid army of curators' (FRS, 1877; MacLeod). The attractiveness of exhibits was also widely doubted, particularly by the head of the Office of Works, Algernon Mitford (Bud, 2009).\nThis vocal challenge to the claims that science would both enlighten and strengthen the British worker was powerful and not restricted to the museum context. It was also being fought out in an enduring debate over the nature and desirability of technical education (Cardwell, 1957; see for instance Armstrong, 1888; and Playfair, 1888). At the same time, Lockyer was a constant campaigner for the permanent museum through personal lobbying and in the columns of Nature. He was also supported strongly by the distinguished Professor of Chemistry at Manchester, Henry Roscoe, who had succeeded Lyon Playfair as chief external witness in a sequence of enquiries through the 1880s. In 1889, for instance, Roscoe had to dispute, in a Parliamentary Committee, an MP\u2019s assertion that the collections were merely 'a quantity of old iron and worn-out models that ought to be consigned to the rubbish heap' (Roscoe, 1906, pp 297\u201398).\nIn 1909, the separate standing of the Science Museum was confirmed when the Victoria and Albert Museum building was opened. Within months a 'Historical Memorandum', Science Museum series no 1, was published by the Board of Education (Cooper, 1909) describing its evolution, althoughonly a single paragraph was allocated to the foundation of the South Kensington Museum, whereas ten were allocated to the developments from the mid-1870s to the mid-1880s. Yet, progressively, as the separate museum was established, the rhetorical reference to the 1876 exhibition diminished. When the Royal Commission on Museums and Galleries published its interim report in 1928, the Museum\u2019s foundation was pushed back to 1852, and in an extensive historical review the Loan exhibition was not mentioned (Royal Commission on National Museums and Galleries, 1928, p 18). This was not from ignorance. Sir Richard Glazebrook, long-time chairman of the Museum\u2019s Advisory Committee was a Commissioner in 1928. In the battle of venerability with other museums, such as the National Maritime Museum in Britain and the Deutsches Museum in Germany, and in the competition to claim baptism by Prince Albert, the complexity of the Science Museum\u2019s institutional origins had been obscured.\nThe concerns of the interwar years parallel the pressures of the 1870s and 1880s and show the continued power of the two narratives about science described in this article. The Final Report of the Royal Commission explored how in Germany 'the modern spirit of interest in scientific progress' had found expression in the Deutsches Museum, which was at the same time an instrument of instruction and a 'symbol of national efficiency' (Royal Commission on National Museums and Galleries, 1930, pp 48\u20139). This was expressed as both a model and a challenge to the British. The need and opportunity of responding to the twin narratives of national rise and potential decline on the one hand, and the rise of science as an international cultural force on the other, were the same as in 1876. Indeed, the 1928 report included a lengthy quotationfrom an 1884 report, which had highlighted the nation\u2019s dependence on 'practical applications of science' (Royal Commission on National Museums and Galleries, 1928, pp 18-19).\nThese issues have persisted. At the end of the 1970s, a century after the holding of the Loan exhibition, two major temporary exhibitions were mounted at the Science Museum. The first, in 1976, was Science and Technology of Islam. The second, in 1980, was Challenge of the Chip, which responded to a government agenda to raise public understanding of micro-electronics. Thus we can argue that the Museum has continued to engage with the narratives of science as, on the one hand transcendental and an internationally shared public good, and on the other hand as a national weapon of industrial and economic supremacy.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work has benefited from research conducted in the course of a fellowship awarded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council number AH/I027177/1 and support from the Science Museum.

In 1675, Robert Hooke confided to his diary that the celebrated clockmaker Thomas Tompion was a \u2018Slug\u2019; in a letter of 1791 the Oxford astronomer Thomas Hornsby referred to the celebrated instrument-maker Jesse Ramsden as \u2018le Sieur Ramsden\u2019[1]. The latter jibe, Sorrenson tells us, was both \u2018mocking\u2019 of Ramsden\u2019s failure to observe the social deference expected of a tradesman, and \u2018sinister\u2019, because it alluded to the revolutionary politics of contemporary France. Between the two, the \u2018mechanics\u2019 of the book\u2019s title, the majority of them instrument-makers, were \u2013 at least the most able of them \u2013 respected and valued as contributing, even exemplary, representatives of the mission of the Society. In Sorrenson\u2019s account, this respect was quickly established and rapidly lost: it extended from Tompion\u2019s business partner George Graham (see Figure 1) to the younger Ramsden himself, before he irritated everyone with his insubordination.\nGraham and the younger Ramsden provide Sorrenson with the most effusive expressions of the Society\u2019s respect. These makers and others who fall between them were, he argues, exemplary Fellows, because their work exhibited the qualities most valued by the Society: the virtues of action over speculation, of fact over theory, and in general of measurement, accuracy and precision, enabled by the improvement of instruments. The existence of tensions is acknowledged: that between the naturalists and the practical mathematicians (Sorrenson finds little place in the Society for pure mathematics) came to a head under Joseph Banks as President and, while the naturalists were predominant, Sorrenson holds that the mechanics were too valuable for the Society to lose them without reputational damage, not least to its international reputation. Sorrenson\u2019s analyses of the social standing of the Fellows and of the subjects included in the Philosophical Transactions across the century are particularly valuable in this context. He concludes that the Society\u2019s factions were based on disciplinary divisions rather than social ones, even though the boundaries resulting from either demarcation would be similar, since the instrument-makers were tradesmen.\nThe central chapters contain valuable accounts of selected mathematical projects or episodes, such as the discovery of stellar aberration, measuring degrees of latitude in different places to determine the shape of the Earth, and the exploratory and hydrographic work of James Cook. In the same way, important instrument innovations are selected, such as Ramsden\u2019s dividing engine and John Ellicott\u2019s compensation pendulum leading to John Smeaton\u2019s pyrometer. Taken with the analysis of the position of the mechanics in the Royal Society, the core of the book is a valuable work of synthesis, drawing together and augmenting what is known into a coherent account.\nThe tone and focus change for the penultimate chapter, headed \u2018Credit and Discredit\u2019. We have already been told of the introduction of the achromatic object lens for telescopes as one of the exemplary mathematical projects, carried through by John Dollond (see Figure 2). Now we have a more spirited account of the argument between his son Peter and the other optical instrument-makers of London, and particularly between Peter Dollond and his brother-in-law Ramsden, over the disputed claims to the invention, as distinct from the manufacturing application and the commercial exploitation, of the achromatic lens.\nSorrenson has no qualms about taking sides and he enlists for Dollond. While Peter Dollond won all his legal battles, Sorrenson holds that his father\u2019s reputation among historians has been blighted ever since by their acceptance of the other makers\u2019 promotion of Chester Moor Hall as the true inventor, made possible by the Royal Society\u2019s failure to defend John Dollond\u2019s position, itself a symptom of a decline in the Society\u2019s esteem of mechanics and their achievements. This account needs to deal somehow with Ramsden\u2019s late espousal of the case for Hall, which Sorrenson explains as an attempt to appear to the Fellows, and to Banks in particular, as concerned for science above commerce.\nWhile the issue is certainly worth discussion, Sorrenson has had to be accommodating regarding certain aspects of the record. For example, it is difficult to continue to maintain that Chester Moor Hall is a \u2018semi-legendary\u2019 figure (Sorrenson\u2019s quotation from a study of 1939), who had to be \u2018dragged from his rural home\u2019 to take part in the episode. In fact we know that Hall had taken the initiative of visiting John Dollond, when he had heard of his work on achromatic lenses and long before there was any priority dispute, and that Peter had afterwards discussed their conversation with his father. It is worth remembering that the legal challenges to Dollond\u2019s patent resulted in its being upheld not because the claims on behalf of Hall\u2019s invention were dismissed but because Dollond had taken the trouble of bringing the invention to a useful outcome. Sorrenson cites the more recent authority Rolf Willach\u2019s remark that we know little about Hall, but it is only fair to remember Willach\u2019s conclusion of 1996 that \u2018the opinion, still expressed sometimes today, that Chester Moor Hall was only a bel-esprit and eccentric mystery-monger ... can now no longer be upheld\u2019 (Willach, 1996, p 202).\nThe final chapter or \u2018Epilogue\u2019 is nearly all about Ramsden (see Figure 3), who is taken to represent the decline of the Royal Society\u2019s notable esteem of outstanding mechanics. Edward Troughton is not discussed but, although his reputation among historians today does not equal that of Ramsden, he carried as much respect and wielded at least as much influence in his slightly later heyday as Ramsden had in his. In 1810, Troughton\u2019s installation of a mural circle (instead of a transit circle) at the Royal Observatory would have a profound, and unfortunate, influence on the international position of English instrument-making and the practice of astronomical measurement in Britain and its empire.\nPrivately recorded insults can be misleading. Notwithstanding the occasional tiff, Hooke rubbed along pretty well with Tompion and acknowledged him generously in print. As for \u2018the Sieur Ramsden\u2019, this was little more than a joke Hornsby shared with the Duke of Marlborough, when writing of Ramsden, who seemed to assume the privileges of a social standing which, as a tradesman, he could not command. The joke was the more telling because Hornsby was writing to his noble friend. Though infuriated and frustrated by Ramsden\u2019s dilatoriness over work he urgently required, Hornsby, generally a good-natured soul, usually maintained an underlying affectionate regard for \u2018that intolerable Villain that lives near St James\u2019s Church\u2019 (i.e. in Piccadilly)[2] and when Ramsden was ill in 1795, Hornsby\u2019s tone was quite different: \u2018I hope the return of his Complaint may be trifling: &amp; that a proper Regimen may continue &amp; keep in good Health so valuable a man for the benefit of Science.\u2019[3]\nHornsby relished telling the Duke of Ramsden\u2019s eccentric and absent-minded behaviour. On a trip from London to Blenheim and Oxford, various items of clothing and instrumentation were forgotten. He had come from London on horseback without a \u2018surtout\u2019 (an overcoat), his only clean shirt had been left at Blenheim and he had forgotten an instrument component for the Duke and the adjusting screws for the new meridian mark he was bringing for Hornsby: \u2018I told him that I wondered he had not left his Head behind. He went away on Tuesday about 12 o\u2019Clock. Pope [one of Ramsden\u2019s workmen] having his Coat for him. &amp; he walked to New Coll. &amp;c. in one of mine.\u2019[4] It is hard to read Ramsden\u2019s casual attitude towards social and commercial conventions as profoundly subversive, or the many jibes, including those from Hornsby, levelled at his dilatoriness as \u2018sinister\u2019.\nEven if the epoch of the Royal Society\u2019s esteem for the mechanic is not so neatly bounded as he claims, Sorrenson is surely right to say that it declined under the influence of the Industrial, if not the French, Revolution, and he has given us a valuable account of its profile and substance through the 18th century."},

But oh what a huge difference a hundred or so years have made. Today\u2019s astronomer will have an airline ticket to some exotic spot \u2013 Hawaii, Chile, Australia, La Palma \u2013 and when there will spend time huddled in an air-conditioned control room letting the computers take the strain of pointing the observatory telescope, and the focal-plane charge-coupled device do the job of assimilating the incoming photons and then passing this data onto some pocket-sized storage device. Little has to be looked at. Subjectivity is at a minimum.\nBut let us follow Omar W Nasim, an academic historian of science, back to the 19th century. I was tempted to say \u2018back to the good old days\u2019, but this is far from the truth. In the 19th century if you wanted to record what a nebula, comet or planet looked like you had to get out there in the cold, quiet and dark and physically clamber up to the eyepiece of the telescope, observe the object with care, and then draw what you saw. Nasim is fascinated by the process that converts the telescopic image to the drawing on a piece of paper. Imagine that you are precariously balanced on your observing platform, adjusting the telescope focus, choosing the magnification of a suitable eyepiece, struggling to keep the astronomical object in the field of view of a cumbersome altazimuth instrument, whilst simultaneously juggling with a pad of art paper and a collection of pencils of different hardness, and then having to draw a picture. You could not get away with just words. Drawing was essential. To quote John Herschel, when viewing Eta Carinae, \u2018it would be manifestly impossible by verbal description to give any just idea of the capricious forms and irregular gradations of light affected by the different branches and appendages of this nebula.\u2019\nThe aim of the drawing process is accuracy and truth. What you draw should be the same as what you see. To quote Robert Hooke in his preface to Micrographia (1665), what is needed is \u2018a sincere hand, and a faithful eye, to examine, and record, the things themselves as they appear\u2019. It should not matter if the person carrying out the observing task is an artist, who knows how to draw, or a scientist who is trying to understand what is being looked at, or a draughtsman/copyist who is indifferent to both attractiveness and knowledge. Ideally the transference of what is seen to what is drawn should not depend on the responsible human. But it inevitably does to some extent. You might expect the artist to improve on the beauty. And the scientist comes with the baggage of a smidgen of supposed understanding of what is actually novel, mysterious and enigmatic. Thinking you might know what the object actually is (a spinning cloud of gas and dust condensing in a Laplacian fashion into a series of planets, for example) might easily bias one\u2019s approach. And, needless to say, as time passes and the more you practise, the better you should get with your pencil and paper.\nAnd there is another problem. It is no use just leaving behind a series of drawings taken by different observers on different nights, in a collection of notebooks. We are talking about professional astronomy here. Results have to be disseminated. Publication is important. The multitude of drawings have to be assimilated and then converted into pictures in books or in research papers using engraving or lithographic techniques. Running through Nasim\u2019s book is the feeling that the old process is \u2018good for you\u2019. If you are forced to draw something accurately, surely you are then forced to look at it in detail and this time-consuming introspection helps you understand the reality. This is far better than the modern-day habit of just pressing a button and recording a photographic \u2018snap\u2019. Being forced to draw something makes you look harder.\nObserving by Hand delves into a minor byway of the history of astronomical science, but I finished the book feeling that only half the story had been told. Nasim revels in the details in the observer\u2019s notebooks, but he underplays the science. The host of astronomers that he mentions were all scientists at heart, and there was a very strong scientific motivation behind their endeavours.\nOnly a handful of nebulae can be picked up by the naked eye, among which are the Andromeda Nebula (which turned out to be a huge stellar galaxy beyond our Milky Way system), the Orion Nebula (which was gaseous, and in parts condensing to form stars), the large and small Magellanic Clouds and the Coal Sack (but here you have to travel to the southern hemisphere). Nebulae are so faint that they really need telescopes, and the first major step in nebula research was made by the French astronomer Charles Messier, who published his first list of \u2018fuzzy celestial objects\u2019 in 1747. Messier was at heart a comet hunter and he longed to be the first to pick up Halley\u2019s Comet at its first predicted return in 1758/59. He listed nebulae so that he would not mistake them for a cometary apparition. But soon nebulae become objects of fascination in their own right. What were they? A cloud of gas and dust was one possibility. Or they might be a cluster of stars, this later possibility only being revealed as the size of telescopic objectives increased and telescopic resolution and light-gathering power improved. As in many new sciences, cataloguing and sorting was the first priority. Remember that the distances to the nebulae were unknown, the first measurement of these quantities only becoming possible in the 1920s. The second priority was the search for change. Were nebulae expanding or contracting, or obviously spinning? Here the subject hit a major snag. Imagine studying a series of drawings of, say, the Orion or the Andromeda Nebula. These drawings would have been produced at different times, using different instruments, at different observing sites on the Earth, and by different people, with different and varying competences. It is obvious that the images would not all be the same. But were they changing because the object itself was varying, or was the change just a function of improvements in the telescopes being used, or in the skills of the person responsible for making the drawings?\nThere were certain key landmarks in the development of the physical understanding of nebulae. Large telescopes resolved many of the nearby nebulae, showing that they were collections of stars. The herd reaction, that is far too common among scientists, then rushed to the conclusion that this new fact applied to all nebulae. Another breakthrough occurred when Lord Rosse, around 1845, turned his new six-foot telescope onto the object M51 and realised that it had a spiral form. As far as discoveries go Dionysius Lardner regarded this as \u2018the most extraordinary and unexpected which modern research has yet disclosed in stellar astronomy\u2019. By the 1850s, true to form, scientists were concluding that all nebulae were spirals. But in 1864 Sir William Huggins, the spectroscopic pioneer, realised that the nebula in Draco (the Cat\u2019s Eye, NGC 6543) was gaseous and radiating a line spectrum. Clearly there was no single answer to the nebula form.\nIt was only after 1880, when the American astronomer Henry Draper started to take the first successful photographs of nebulae, that this dichotomy problem started to drift away.\nNasim concentrates on the work of great nebula astronomers. The pioneer was William Herschel, who, having built himself the largest telescope in the world in the early 1770s, saw nebulae as no-one else had done before. He also published a plate of engraved figures showing his results. His son John Herschel followed in his footsteps, and well into the 1840s the Herschels had the monopoly in the subject.\nIn a successful attempt to break this dominance William Parsons (the 3rd Earl of Rosse) built the Leviathan of Parsonstown. This 1.8-metre aperture reflector was first used in 1845. Rosse and his assistants produced a host of drawings, their mezzotint of the Whirlpool Galaxy being revolutionary. Taking up the American baton we have Ebenezer Porter Mason, who changed the Herschelian approach of triangulating the nebula details using a grid made up of lines joining the field stars, by introducing the concept of isophotes \u2013 contour lines of equal brightness. In 1844 William Lassell, a Liverpudlian gentleman astronomer, built a 0.61-metre aperture reflector that was equatorially mounted. Now instead of the nebula being visible for only a few minutes per night, as was the case with the previous altazimuth giants, it could be smoothly tracked for a few hours per night, and thus drawn more accurately. Lassell went so far as to produce three oil paintings of nebulae and he presented these to the Royal Astronomical Society. Mindful of their importance in the heritage of this subject the society subsequently \u2018lost\u2019 them. The next nebula specialist was the German astronomer Wilhelm Tempel, who had the added advantage of being a trained lithographer. He did most of his important work at the Arcetri Observatory in Florence. Over in America, William Cranch Bond and his son George used the Harvard telescopes to investigate the Orion Nebula. Much effort was expended in trying to decide whether it was either a gaseous cloud or a spiral galaxy.\nA lot of astronomical endeavour in the 19th century was expended on observing and drawing nebulae. These drawings were then carefully assimilated into end-product engravings and lithographs that featured prominently in a host of scientific articles and textbooks. But to what avail? Maybe Owen Gingerich, the Harvard historian of astronomy, was right in dismissing these images as being of \u2018mere antiquarian interest\u2019. When it comes to understanding nebulae the 19th-century astronomer just did not have the kit. The telescopes were too small, the image recording process too inefficient and the spectroscopic understanding too crude. The breakthrough started much later, around November 1917, when first light hit the mirror of the 2.5-metre Hooker telescope at Mount Wilson, California. Add to this the insight of Edwin Hubble, and the ability to measure astronomical distances, and soon the curtain was drawn back on the mysterious nature of nebulae.\nObserving by Hand is a beautifully produced book and the images are stunning. Hidden in the text is a fascinating story trying hard to escape, a break-out which is somewhat masked by the excessive verbosity of the text, and the downplaying of the scientific motivation behind the whole endeavour.\n\u00a0\nObserving by Hand: Sketching the Nebulae in the Nineteenth Century by Omar W Nasim is published by The University of Chicago Press, 2014.\u00a0The images that appear here are selected from the large number of drawings published in the book.\u00a0"},

Historical collections can be of value to museum visitors in countless ways, many \u2013 perhaps the majority \u00ad\u2013 of which relate to how they understand the past in general, and in our case here, the past of science and technology in particular. In that sense, museums are part of the phenomenon known as \u2018public history\u2019, a term with many nuances of usage, ranging from top-down popularisations by academic historians via many types of cultural consumption, of museums, heritage attractions, magazines and broadcasts, to bottom-up amateur historical research. (Jordanova, 2006, pp 141-71; de Groot, 2008). The rationale for the Science Museum Group\u2019s public history programme is to develop our understanding of this field, both because we are actors in the public presentation of history, and because the historical knowledge and beliefs of visitors that exist before they enter the museum are vital determinants of their experience. In other words, our programme is about both the \u2018broadcast\u2019 and the \u2018reception\u2019 of public histories. We are optimistic that from better understanding will flow more effective museum practice. Our public history research programme is composed of a series of connected investigations that seek to deepen our understanding of this field. Our first significant experiment was, in 2011, Oramics to Electronica: Revealing Histories of Electronic Music, a project that involved several different kinds of participation involving different audience groups, producing both an exhibition and museum programmes.[1] In this, participation with the selected groups was equally designed to reveal the historical thought styles of the groups involved, and to facilitate the creation of the exhibition. The approach was one of co-curation (discussed below), on the grounds that there is a conceptual kinship between public history and co-curation that enables the latter to give insights into the former (Boon, 2011a). By providing a deeper, more practical, level of involvement, it also proposes new registers of public historical participation beyond those discussed by David Thelen in the classic public history text The Presence of the Past. His model of historical participation as it relates to museums is much more \u2018downstream\u2019 than that in our project; the respondents to the survey on which the book is founded were active historical participants in the sense that existing museum displays enabled their empathetic engagement with the past. (Rosenzweig &amp; Thelen, 1998, p 195). In our project they were active historical participants because they co-created the account that appeared in the museum\u2019s exhibition and public programme; their interpretations were public rather than private. Sharon Macdonald states that a museum is \u2018a suggested way of seeing the world\u2019 (quoted in Onciul, 2013, p 81). No museum display is an objective statement; exhibitions always express the particular accounts of their subject chosen by their authors, whether the view selected \u2013 in objects, pictures, texts and other media \u2013 is that of the lone curator or the corporate voice of exhibition teams. In either case, there has, in many museums, often been an institutional impetus to render the story embodied in the show \u2018clean\u2019, unitary and consistent. Such exhibitions might be said to have a \u2018monophonic\u2019 voice. In the project under discussion, however, we set out to produce a \u2018polyphonic\u2019 exhibition; that is, one that expressed several different views of its subjects. Our argument starts from the assumption that any museum display will have different meanings for different visitors. Personal knowledge, interests and experience mean that each of us brings something different to our encounter with displays. Within constructivist accounts proposed by authors such as George Hein (1995, pp. 21-23), displays enable visitors to construct their own accounts of the subjects. These accounts are different from visitor to visitor, and more detailed where the visitor\u2019s enthusiasm for, and knowledge of, the subject depicted is greater. Congruently, Viv Golding suggests that \u2018the situated nature of knowledge and the political positioning of museum authority [\u2026] can be challenged by the experience, beliefs, and emotions visitors bring with them\u2019 (Golding 2013, p 13). It is appropriate therefore to be sceptical about the interest \u2013 even legibility \u2013 to museum visitors of the narratives embodied in exhibitions by exhibition makers. This in its turn is reinforced by the work of Michel de Certeau on the nature of cultural consumption (Boon, 2011b, De Certeau, 1984). He suggests that the consumers of culture are the agents of the meanings they construct. In his most memorable metaphor, he argues that consumers are like poachers; active on somebody else\u2019s territory and grabbing what they want, a \u2018rabbit\u2019 that might, incidentally, be of little value to the \u2018landowner\u2019. If audiences grab what they want from our displays, then it is arguable that the embodied narrative we impose becomes \u2013 in the purest case \u2013 chiefly a matter of convenience to us in deciding what we\u2019d like to put where. One of the present authors witnessed an example of this when partaking in an accompanied visit to the Science Museum.[2] When the family he was accompanying encountered the World War Two era V2 rocket in the Making the Modern World gallery, they discussed not the stories presented in the label \u2013 the beginnings of space flight and the slave labour used to manufacture the rockets \u2013 but the local history of Croydon, their home town, where many of these flying bombs had landed. This \u2018different visitors / different meanings\u2019 model has much in common with the \u2018interpretative flexibility\u2019 described by sociologists of technology, in which the same technological innovation may mean different things to different groups within society (Pinch and Bijker 1984). In the case of museum visiting, such individual interpretations are private, and only rarely accessible to museum staff. Oramics to Electronica sought to answer the question of how it would be if an exhibition were to be made starting with such different interpretations as well as being consumed in this way. The work of narratologists is also relevant here; they use the term \u2018story\u2019 to denote a source, the set of events that may be represented in any narrative; \u2018narratives\u2019, by contrast, involve the conveying of the events in the story in alternative ways, not necessarily in the same sequence (Cobley, 2001, pp. 5-6, Boon, 2008, pp. 27-8). Our proposal was to make an exhibition that started from the assumption that visitors construct their own narratives in a self-directed (and not necessarily conscious) bricolage that combines exhibition contents and their pre-existing modes of thought. The corollary in the production of displays is that it makes perfect sense to include multiple narratives, reproducing in the Museum the tangle of narratives and information that we daily encounter in that deeply insanitary and engaging place, the external non-museum world. Our experiment could be seen as addressing some of Laurajane Smith\u2019s concerns about the ways in which \u2018the authorised heritage discourse (AHD)\u2019 \u2013 a heritage of country houses and similar attractions \u2013 places constraints on whose material history counts as heritage. As she argues, \u2018much of that the debate is centred on a concern about getting more people to come to authorised heritage, rather than to considering if the heritage that we save and promote as heritage actually is representative of the diversity of historical and contemporary social and cultural experiences\u2019 (2009, p4). In the Oramics project, we started with a subject area and focus object far distant from Smith\u2019s AHD and proceeded \u2018to embrace a wide range of cultural practices and values\u2019 (2009, p 1). This recognised that people with different backgrounds will engage with cultural content in different ways (Smith, 2009, Crooke, 2010, Chitty, 2011). Unlike Smith\u2019s focus, however, our project did not concentrate primarily on the social exclusion of classes and ethnicities, but on what might be termed the \u2018cognitive exclusion\u2019 of a subject \u2013electronic music \u2013 outside the AHD but significant to individuals and subcultures. In this, our approach also differs from the weight of the museum participation literature, which reveals three dominant uses of participation in museums: the engagement of local community groups, empowerment of minority groups, and collaboration with source communities or indigenous groups. For Bryony Onciul, participatory projects are \u2018engagement zones\u2019; \u2018every engagement zone is unique because of the individuals involved, as well as the context, time, place, and amount of power shared\u2019 (Onciul, 2013, pp 81). What this meant in our practice will become clear as we describe the various sub-projects in more detail. If, as Onciul suggests, \u2018museums are political spaces where society frames its authorized culture, history, and identity\u2019 (Onciul, 2013, p 81), then projects like ours can be seen to challenge the arbitrary constituents of the AHD."},

The show was performed live at museum venues across the UK during 2014, and at the Museums Association Conference in Cardiff. Mat Fraser won the Observer Ethical Award for Arts and Culture in 2014 for the piece.\nPersonal, but based on research evidence, and combining myriad performance pieces within the format of a lecture, Cabinet of Curiosities offers a kaleidoscope of experiences and perspectives and, beyond the traditional role of a cabinet of curiosities, asks focused questions about some hard and conflicting truths.\nDeveloped by actor and musician Mat Fraser, in collaboration with Jocelyn Dodd and Richard Sandell at the Research Centre for Museums and Galleries at the University of Leicester, and with the involvement of an authoritative array of museums of science and medicine, Cabinet of Curiosities is a one-man performance featuring an eclectic juxtaposition of academic lecture, autobiographical reflection, disability activism, punk, rap, social documentary, music hall pastiche and whimsy, to name but some of the modes that Mat Fraser nimbly guides his audience through.\nIt is tempting to try to define what this piece is, but that would lead us away from the more important question of why the collaborators have chosen to explore this complex subject in this way.\nMat Fraser begins with an explanation of his early concept for a comedy cabaret performance, which he swiftly abandoned with the realisation that the content he was researching was inherently \u2018not funny\u2019. Comedy is not lost as a mode of engagement however, as he compensates by building a comic theme around the prevailing absence of humour, emphasising the few jokes he can lever in throughout the 90-minute show (highlighting the 300 people with dwarfism living in the freak show village at Coney Island in the 1920s he says, \u2018You can\u2019t quite imagine the scale.\u2019). Not a laugh a minute; but we begin to see that the different modes of presentation incorporated in this performance are critical to relieving tensions between the artist and the audience, and vital to conveying the complexity of emotions inherent in the content.\nFrom the outset, the depth of research on which the performance is built is evident. Mat Fraser has worked with a carefully chosen group of museums of science or medicine to explore the history of how disability has been collected, catalogued, stored and displayed within their sphere. His outsider\u2019s perspective on the museum process, and its impact both on people with disabilities and on the visiting public, is the starting point for the breathtaking juxtaposition of how things are currently done versus how they could (and should) be done.\nA good example of the unthinking damage that has been done, and the converse potential that could be realised, is shown by the deconstruction of the concept of a \u2018black box\u2019. In museums, which are regarded as trustworthy and authoritative by the public, an interpreted \u2018permanent\u2019 display can be regarded as the final word and is often unchanging. This marries well with the scientific concept of a black box as \u2018a concept which is defined, understood and no longer needs to be reconsidered\u2019, akin to the definitive account given by an aeroplane\u2019s black-box flight recorder. Contrast this, however, with the performing arts\u2019 concept of a black box as \u2018a space where you take risks with new ideas, hoping for some kind of change\u2019. Not an approach typically associated with museums, but the message is clear: museums have much to gain from experimenting with other approaches and perspectives through which new interpretations would be created, giving greater validity and relevance.\nThrough this broader approach, the lecture content posits that museums have the opportunity to reverse the cultural apartheid that has seen people with disabilities included in museum displays only because of their disabilities, often in medical museums illustrating developments in engineering, science or medicine. The answer and the opportunity is to include disabled people by virtue of their other roles, as parents, children, professionals or members of the community, and ultimately to show how society is enriched by their inclusion and participation.\nThis vision could feel like a brave, new world, but we are acutely aware of the sense of Mat\u2019s summing-up: this is a no-brainer, there is no justification for the fact that it did not happen yesterday, museums must get on and do it and make sure that it happens tomorrow.\nIt is a blunt message, so how is it made palatable? There are several means by which this is achieved.\nMat Fraser assumes the role of both lead dramatist and sympathetic narrator in the story, stepping back from the academic register of the research content to comment directly, and less formally, on the material he is sharing. He remains a well-informed, reasonable and reassuring guide for his audience, and alongside this he acknowledges the guilt and fear of medics and museums, and also shares his own anger and frustration as a participant in the story.\nThe project\u2019s extensive research is demonstrated through the interleaved layers of more formal lecture. This evidence-based argument provides the objective stance which relieves the tension and emotion inherent in the opposing viewpoints explored in the piece. It builds to point the way to a self-evident conclusion about the overdue need for change.\nThe strength of the different performance approaches is brought to bear on some of the more confrontational or contentious aspects of the content, for example the definitions of the medical, charity and social models of disability are set to music with an early-20th-century parodied voiceover and graphic style.\nI found Mat\u2019s autobiographical recollection of personal encounters with the medical profession some of the most striking and disturbing content in the piece, and the complexity of this proposition is expressed through punk. Mat recounts the medical profession\u2019s guilty, and potentially salacious, fascination with his body, as a living specimen of the effects of the thalidomide drug on an unborn baby. He renders these combined memories into an aggressive punk thrash piece, which culminates in the incredible yell of \u2018You have the bones of a DOG!\u2019 \u2013 a direct quotation of a qualified doctor speaking to a patient affected by thalidomide.\nThis unique portrayal captures the dual perspective of patient and physician in the medical encounter and the rawness of emotion in both parties: the guilt, fear, anger and authority of the doctor faced with the embarrassment of the medical failure inherent in the thalidomide scandal, and the offensive, invasive and frightening impact on the patient. I defy a museum label or text to do justice to this complexity and, in this way, we see that the multiple modes of engagement are not an aside or a chaotic distraction but actually the real point of this show. Through performance art we can convey that which would be reduced or lost through words on a page or a censorious lecture.\nUltimately, this is the point of Cabinet of Curiosities. Research and evidence yes, but information, knowledge and learning do not equate to understanding. For that we need emotion. Messy and uncivilised, we are taught from an early age to control our emotions and to limit their place in learning. Cabinet of Curiosities shows that we need to give much more scope and validity to the emotional response, and open up museum practice to finding new modes of engaging the public (all of the public) with the objects that are chosen to represent our society.\nFinding ways of successfully portraying the emotion with which objects and experiences are charged is the real goal and success of Cabinet of Curiosities. Some subjects demand and deserve emotional honesty and should not be divorced from that context. This is the accusation levelled at museums of science and medicine, which have unthinkingly colluded with the spheres they represent to perpetuate notions of what is normal and what is different. If interpretation is created without the involvement of those who have been systematically excluded from the mainstream, then museums will continue to reflect an unjust society instead of taking up the challenge of shaping a new social reality.\nTowards the conclusion of the show, this point is made once more by overlaying a medical film with the oral testimony of Terry Wiles, who was also affected by the thalidomide drug. Terry is shown as a toddler standing on a table on prosthetic legs which make his natural limbs redundant. We see the medical definitions of his missing and residual limbs, and witness the proposed medical-technological solutions to his perceived problem.\nTerry\u2019s own voiceover in the present effectively puts the words of common sense into the mouth of a toddler. He felt unwieldy and unsafe, as though his personality had been changed and that nobody listened to his protests. This individual, social perspective completely changes our understanding of the prosthetic limbs shown. These are real artefacts in the Science Museum\u2019s collections, which could easily be interpreted as an assistive innovation, but are more accurately summed up by Terry as \u2018stupid\u2019.\nThe performance begins and ends with haunting and questing music and photographic representations of people with disabilities, many from historic freak shows. By the end, our understanding of these people as individuals and of their decisions to take control of their lives or inability to do so because of socially imposed systems should have been transformed. The only correct response to the yearning optimism expressed in the final song is to act and make a change."},

Social practice theory is a theoretical approach that corrects for these reductions, directing attention to interaction between people and technologies and acknowledging the importance of social relations and culturally-embedded knowledge in the formation of household practices. Over the past couple of decades, social practice theory has begun to get a foothold in consumption studies and policies aimed at reducing the environmental impacts of consumption (Warde, 2005; Shove et al, 2012). Social practice theory has its roots in the work of Bourdieu (1977; 1998) and his concept of habitus, defined as a domain of dispositions for action, created and perpetuated through performance of a practice in a given social-cultural space. These dispositions constitute a form of knowledge which influences or disposes subsequent practices. The habitus engages with the \u2018presence of the past\u2019 (Bourdieu, 1998, p 304) in forming and embodying knowledge. In other words, social practice theory takes account of the fact that many consumption actions have histories, both at the societal and individual levels, and that these histories make themselves present in current actions (Ortner, 2006).\nIn the recent surge in interest in social practice theory, the definition of a practice by Reckwitz has been widely accepted. He defines a practice in the following way (2002, p 249, cited in Warde, 2005): \u2018A \u201cpractice\u201d (Praktik) is a routinized type of behaviour which consists of several elements, interconnected to one another: forms of bodily activities, forms of mental activities, \u201cthings\u201d and their use, a background knowledge in the form of understanding, know-how, states of emotion and motivational knowledge.\u2019 Practices involve the exercise of reflexivity and intentionality, but also bring to bear embodied and tacit knowledge, the latter mainly absent from the theorising of consumption in mainstream research (Wallenborn and Wilhite, 2014). Social practice theory acknowledges the importance of the material (things and technologies) in shaping practices. This material perspective is particularly relevant for understanding practices that take place within the four walls of the home, such as cleaning clothes, preparing food, and attending to thermal comfort levels in the house (heating and cooling) (Wilhite, 2012; Wilhite, 2015). An important grouping of materialities that have saturated homes in places like the USA, Europe and Japan is the household energy appliances such as televisions, refrigerators, washing machines, microwaves and air conditioners. These are now central to home entertainment, food, cleanliness and comfort in the rich countries of the world and are rapidly making their way into households everywhere. These technologies are situated in the home, but are anchored in an interlinked regime of infrastructural technologies that bear energy, food and water through systems of provision and into homes, industries and both public and commercial buildings.The refrigerator is the most widely diffused of the household appliances. One might assume from its appearance and controls that it is innocuous. Once in place in the home and plugged in, the refrigerator requires little control or adjustment by its owner. It performs its task of producing chilled air in an insulated cabinet with virtually no need for intervention or management. This design simplicity and mundaneness, along with the use of bland colours (hence the designation \u2018white good\u2019) have been part of a strategy by manufacturers to emphasise its normal place in home food practices (Shove and Southerton, 2000). Compared with the \u2018conspicuous\u2019 technologies such as the car, smart phones and the various home entertainment systems, the refrigerator and freezer have quietly and un-dramatically made themselves essential and normal to food preparation in the rich OECD countries. This normalising process played out over the course of a half century from the early to mid-twentieth century. As I will discuss below, the bland appearance is deceiving. The refrigerator has played an important role in comprehensive changes in food practices in OECD countries and is rapidly spreading to the so-called emerging economies where household practices are changing rapidly (Hansen and Wethal, 2015). India began a period of rapid change in both political economy and household practices with a significant shift in its openness to global markets in the 1990s. Below, I will discuss the \u2018opening\u2019 of the Indian economy to global markets and transnational capital in the early 1990s and how many of the household technologies that were normal in the households of USA and Europe became available and affordable in India. The aftermath of this \u2018opening\u2019 provided an excellent setting for researching the relative strengths of technology scripts, local knowledge and social relations in retarding and/or enabling changes in practices. Based on a generous research grant from the Norwegian Research Council I was able to fully deploy ethnographic methods to the study of changing household consumption in the state of Kerala in South India over a period of several years in the early 2000s (Wilhite, 2008a). Kerala was one of the highest consuming States in India in the 1990s and 2000s, despite its history of social democratic governance and strong redistributive economic policies. During this period, Kerala led all other states in the consumption of many \u2018durable goods\u2019, including cars and household appliances. Another unique aspect of Kerala society is the high proportion of Christians relative to other states \u2013 about thirty per cent of the population is Christian. The Christian church was established early in Kerala, with evidence of a Christian ministry as early as the first century AD. The long coexistence between Hindu and Christian (Muslims constitute only about ten per cent of the population) has led to a cross-fertilisation of cultural rituals and practices, including practices involving food.My research was centred in urban, middle class neighbourhoods in Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum), Kerala and surrounding villages, which are made up of a mix of socio-economic groups from poor to middle class. The methods deployed included:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Deep participation. My wife, two children and I rented a house in a middle-class neighbourhood in Trivandrum and developed close relationships with neighbours and their extended families.\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Semi-structured interviews with over one hundred households representing differing castes, household types and age groups. Repeat interviews were conducted with about twenty households. \u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The use of diaries by selected female head of households in which they recorded time used in daily practices on various activities like cooking, washing clothes, shopping and watching television.\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0A survey questionnaire with four hundred households, conducted by female research assistants. The survey contributed data on issues such as the size of the house, technologies owned, family income, family size, ages of family members, educational levels and type of work.\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Interviews in retail appliance stores with customers, managers and sales personnel.\nAnother important source of information was discussions with local scholars at the Centre for Development Studies in Trivandrum and an extensive review of local literature and policy documents. These various methods together provided an excellent platform for the analysis of changing household practices as new technologies became widely available in the 1990s and early 2000s."},

Apart from disease-conquering sewers, the railways, and electricity, we still owe much to the Victorian conviction that only the application of science in technology will bring progress, no matter the inequality that arises. Yet those very Victorian notions still limit our appreciation of history before the Enlightenment, because Victorian beliefs about the positive value of science inevitably denigrated what they dismissed as \u2018superstition\u2019, meaning magic and occult philosophy. This involved the social dismissal of alchemy, astrology, and contact with the spirit world, relegating them to a belief-system confused with the annual cycle of agricultural folk-rituals, and identified with the \u2018lower orders\u2019. Early nineteenth-century proto-anthropologists, busily recording those popular agrarian customs being erased by industrial capitalism, such as the late Victorian \u2018scientific\u2019 belief in \u2018the people\u2019s\u2019 apparent opposition to \u2018modern\u2019 thought, created a vast social chasm between the intellectual elite and the emotive world of the deluded masses.The results appear in the sea-change in Victorian historiography about Elizabeth I and her court. Until the mid-nineteenth century the Queen\u2019s biographers happily acknowledged her fascination with alchemy, her implicit belief in astrology \u2013 which she shared with her leading courtiers \u2013 and even her occasional participation in spirit magic, because the surviving papers from her reign amply demonstrated them. By the late nineteenth century, however, cataloguers began to omit magical beliefs from their descriptions of those papers, artificially separating the leaders of court society from \u2018magicians\u2019 like John Dee. For example, the catalogue of Lord Burghley\u2019s papers, published from 1883, carefully obscured evidence of Burghley\u2019s obsessive belief in alchemy and his political anxieties about astrological influences. This helped to foster the twentieth-century belief that the Elizabethan elite, while dressed in exotic-looking clothes, thought just like modern politicians. While this has contributed to the publishing and multi-media success of the cottage industry now known as \u2018The Tudors\u2019, it has not created an informed understanding of their world. It has attracted interest to figures like Dee precisely because he is seen as a marginalised outlier, a sinister figure who fascinated a court he simultaneously horrified, as he does the modern audience. By giving a prominent place to Henry Gillard Glindoni\u2019s pre-1913 painting of John Dee performing an experiment before Elizabeth I, the recent exhibition of John Dee\u2019s books at the Royal College of Physicians nails its colours firmly to this conventional Victorian mast. Glindoni\u2019s circle of skulls, within which Dee originally stood, have been painted out, but the painting still distances Dee from his scandalised courtly audience. One would never guess that one of those glittering noblemen, Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford (and Burghley\u2019s son-in-law), not only claimed to have conjured spirits himself, but to have had sex with them.\nWithin these limits, the College displayed about fifty books selected from a hundred volumes donated by the descendants of Henry Pierrepont (the Marquis of Dorchester) after his death in 1680, the largest single collection from Dee\u2019s library of over three thousand books. They demonstrate Dee\u2019s wide reading in ancient history and languages, astronomy, cryptography and mathematics, as well as alchemical medicine and occult studies. Throughout the exhibition attention is drawn to Dee\u2019s voluminous marginalia, yet restricting the display to the College\u2019s collection obscures Dee\u2019s purpose in annotating his books: to organise information across books in dialogue with one another. His cross-references to books extant in other collections are more historically significant than the beauty of his marginalia. For example, much is made of Dee\u2019s stunning marginal drawing in Cicero\u2019s Opera (1539\u201340) of a ship in full sail, but it is not connected with his other drawing of such a ship, that steered by Elizabeth in the heavily-encoded title page of his General and rare memorials pertayning to the Perfect Arte of navigation (1577), now in the British Library. Sea power as the basis of the \u2018British Empire\u2019 fascinated Dee, but the title-page of Memorials reveals that he imagined Elizabeth\u2019s predestined imperial rule over all of Christian Europe. Significantly, Memorials proposed to achieve that empire by creating the philosophers\u2019 stone in an alchemical research institute supported from general taxation. Similarly, the exhibition\u2019s display of objects connected to his angelic s\u00e9ances, including a crystal ball and a \u2018scrying\u2019 mirror to discern angels, did not mention Dee\u2019s belief that the angels inspired and supported his alchemical endeavours and imperial advice to Elizabeth.\nThe exhibition displayed Dee\u2019s life thematically, as scholar, courtier, alchemist, doctor and magician. This partly obscured the fact that \u2013 to his contemporaries \u2013 for much of his life Dee was all of these things at once. His court career also explains some of the deceptions which Dee practised on his own time and posterity, but which were uncritically accepted in the display. The exhibition claimed that Dee was arrested in 1555 for drawing up Mary I\u2019s horoscope, and was placed under house arrest with Edmund Bonner, the Catholic Bishop of London. This false statement originated with Dee, and the circumstances of its creation underline the need to place Dee more fully in his contemporary context than the exhibition achieved. Dee was in fact ordained a Catholic priest in February 1554, with Bonner\u2019s assistance, and became Bonner\u2019s chaplain. The first accounts of the Protestant martyrs published under Elizabeth, especially John Foxe\u2019s so-called Book of Martyrs (1563) blamed \u2018beastly\u2019 Bonner for their sufferings. Dee\u2019s rivals for alchemical patronage at Court in the 1560s used this information to darken Dee\u2019s \u2018conjuring\u2019 reputation, forging further \u2018evidence\u2019 of his persecution of Protestants. Dee could only respond in 1577, when he temporarily gained political influence by writing Memorials, which supported the Earl of Leicester\u2019s campaign to make Elizabeth undertake her imperial destiny in Europe. Leicester forced Foxe to rewrite his book so that Dee became Bonner\u2019s household prisoner and a proto-Protestant martyr. This blend of magic, politics and religion typifies Dee\u2019s career, but even though the exhibition displayed Andreas Alexander\u2019s Mathemalogium prime partis (1504) with Dee\u2019s annotation that he read it in September 1555 in \u2018the house of my singular friend\u2019 Bonner, the contradiction between this evidence and the larger claims of the exhibition is passed over in silence.The exhibition therefore was not the last word on Dee, nor could it be, given the breadth of his interests and the voluminous surviving evidence about them, both in the Royal College of Physicians and many other archives. Its success in drawing large crowds and much media interest is to be congratulated, but if we are to develop a more sophisticated understanding of the Tudor age, we need to accept that its strangeness from our time is part of its attraction. The idea that an exhibition needs to challenge the preconceptions of its audience rather than reinforce them may seem ambitious, but there are grounds for optimism about the ability of new historical scholarship to inform the public perception of \u2018The Tudors\u2019. The tide may be turning once again towards a fuller appreciation of the centrality of magic, and Dee, in Elizabeth\u2019s court, when recent \u2018popular\u2019 studies drawing upon more informed Dee research, such as Tracy Borman\u2019s The Private Lives of the Tudors: Uncovering the Secrets of Britain's Greatest Dynasty and Anna Whitelock\u2019s Elizabeth\u2019s Bedfellows: An Intimate History of the Queen\u2019s Court firmly reject the Victorian marginalisation of Dee\u2019s occult philosophy."},

I didn\u2019t know what to expect when I accepted a commission to translate an exhibition for the small Carinthian museum, wissens.wert.welt in Klagenfurt. An exhibition on colour, I was told, a multi-disciplinary approach: art history; biology; physics; optics; and chemistry. A hands-on exhibition for children from the age of five, families, adult and tourist groups (some from other countries, such as neighbouring Italy and Slovenia, hence the English translation). \u201cAn ambitious project,\u201d I thought, \u201chow do you pitch such an exhibition and provide people of all ages with a fun day out and at the same time a worthwhile learning experience?\u201d\nNow I know how you can do it. With creativity, resourcefulness, a good team, supportive partners and a large amount of audacity. Frau Magister Sumper, manager and curator, pointed out that she relied on her small team and the generosity of her partners: Faber Castell, which provided the materials for the station, \u2018Make your own felt-tip pen\u2019; and Kremer Pigments, which provided valuable pigments for the showcase \u2018Colours from minerals and nature\u2019. The education team of the National Gallery in London generously allowed the use of two video clips: Making Green: Tempera versus Oil and Making Purple: The Science of Art. Dr Ricchiardi from the Fitzwilliam Museum kindly permitted the translation of their material on analytical methods of studying Old Masters. I was familiar with the intellectual content of the exhibition from my translation work, but it was only when I visited the exhibition during my summer holidays that I got to have a go at all the activities at the various stations.\nThe exhibition is based on the six-part colour circle. It takes up an area of 120m2 and has seven main sections with 21 stations. Except for staffing costs, the exhibition came in at 14,000 Euros (this figure includes a very small amount for flyers and marketing). It was possible to cope with this small budget because much of the work was created in-house in their own workshop.For this exhibition, the beautifully illustrated panels contain short pieces of text with reduced vocabulary in a large font for young visitors and more traditionally detailed explanations for older students and adults. The English translation is below each text in a smaller font. Even the text for children is translated into English, as Austrian children start learning English in primary school and are comfortable with being confronted by text in a foreign language. In the bottom right-hand corner are the instructions for a relevant hands-on activity. Take the panel on indigo \u2013 the history of dyeing with indigo is discussed and in parallel there is a hands-on opportunity for visitors to have a go at printing a piece of fabric with a traditional stamp and indigo dye. Also, at the entrance to the museum, in a little garden area, visitors can see six different native dye plants growing. It surprises children to see that the flowers for the indigo dye are in fact yellow.\nAn interesting innovation are the goggles created by David Riepan, an art historian and electrical engineer. The team conceived of the idea of such goggles when posing the question, \u2018What would the world look like without colour?\u2019 Switch them on and everything appears in black and white. Some stations deal with sensory perception and the emotional reaction to certain colours, others with biological concepts such as signal colouration and camouflage. Electromagnetic waves and gamma rays are discussed alongside the making of dyes and colour mixing, using a hands-on approach with touch-sensitive computer screens.\nI was fascinated to see digital magnification of a variety of paint samples, from oil to egg tempera. Frau Magister Sumper, who is also a trained artist, created a set of different paint samples to demonstrate the variety of textures and consistencies, so important in the restoration of paintings. In this exhibition, science is a means of exploring colour. However, the children are not aware that they are \u2018doing\u2019 science. Of course, the panels for the adult visitors go into greater depth and contain more scientific explanation. Analytical methods discussed include optical microscopy, reflectance spectroscopy, near-Infrared imaging, Fourier-Transform Infrared spectroscopy, macro XRF scanning, RGB composite maps and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy. What impresses me so much about this approach is the opportunity for family learning. Parents and children can enjoy the same exhibition at different levels and have a shared learning experience. Children can observe their parents learning and families can discuss their new-found knowledge.\nSome critics might say that the exhibition touches on too many subjects and doesn\u2019t deal with each scientific area in enough detail. However, the idea, I\u2019m told, is to interest children in the process of discovery so that they will want to keep discovering science when they go away. From the comments in the visitors\u2019 book and on social media you can see that the exhibition has been well-received. I asked the curator what sorts of questions the children asked and she gave me two examples: \u2018Are all the colours really hidden in our light?\u2019 and, \u2018Is the red dye from a louse really in the red Gummy Bears?\u2019Which brings me to the only weak point, in my estimation: the marketing materials. It might make the exhibition more attractive to visitors and teachers alike if the leaflets pointed out that the exhibition has a multi-disciplinary approach with an emphasis on science. The title, More than Colours, implies more but does not in itself spell it out. A teacher might want curriculum-linked information, showing that the study of colour can be relevant to what they are teaching in school. It is such an excellent exhibition, I would want every child to be able to experience it."},

The \u2018ages\u2019, treated in seven half-hour episodes, are not all equal in length of period or breadth of coverage, but all allow Jardine to explore concepts that have been central to academic history of science in recent decades. It is a series not simply about the people who carried out experiments, observations and calculations, but one that puts them in their context and demonstrates the relevance of politics, economics, craft skills, education, warfare, imperialism, religion, spectacle, technology, aesthetics and geography to the development of scientific knowledge.\nThe seven episodes are: \u2018Age of Ingenuity\u2019 (London and the Royal Society at the end of the 17th century), \u2018Age of Exploration\u2019 (18th-century botany, exploration and empire), \u2018Age of Opportunity\u2019 (the Industrial Revolution, Wedgwood and the Lunar Men), \u2018Age of Inspiration\u2019 (19th-century science\u2019s big ideas, from electromagnetism to evolution), \u2018Age of the Lab\u2019 (the creation, from the end of the 19th century, of distinct spaces in which science happens), \u2018Age of War\u2019 (the impact of both world wars) and \u2018Age of Now\u2019. As coherent characterisations, some of these are more satisfactory than others. Ingenuity and inspiration, at least, might apply to almost any period, while the rise of the research laboratory and response to war are significantly more focused concepts (see Figure 1).\nHowever, over the whole, Jardine convincingly builds up a set of developments that lead her to a picture of what science has become in the 21st century.\nThere are, inevitably, gaps and biases, reflecting the interests of Jardine, her contributors and existing literature. (Recent books aimed at a Radio 4-listening public \u2013 for example Patricia Fara\u2019s An Entertainment for Angels and Sex, Botany and Empire, Richard Holmes\u2019s The Age of Wonder, Jenny Uglow\u2019s The Lunar Men and Graham Farmelo\u2019s Churchill\u2019s Bomb \u2013 seem to have been behind many of the choices made, and not only because these authors were significant contributors on air.) One example is that 18th-century astronomy is represented only by William Herschel, echoing Holmes\u2019s account of Herschel exploring the skies in analogy with Banks\u2019s botanical collecting in the South Seas. This ignores the much more dominant project of positional astronomy, which was directly allied to voyages of exploration and survey. The \u2018shift in emphasis\u2019 from mathematics and mechanics to collecting and classifying that Jardine identifies at the beginning of this episode is more of a shift of disciplinary focus than a change over time. That the series is \u2018a personal view\u2019 is particularly clear in the first episode, with its focus on Robert Hooke, Jardine\u2019s declared \u2018personal hero\u2019. This is also the only episode that Jardine suggested renaming. Buckley had originally suggested \u2018Age of Experiment\u2019, but by broadening the title Jardine is better able to present her view of Hooke and of the importance of artisans and instrument-makers to experimental philosophy in Restoration London (see Figure 2).\nHowever, such choices and lacunae are inevitable. What is enjoyable is that the topics covered are supported, and indeed defined, by expert contributors. Few radio and TV documentaries give this kind of power to the experts, and it was in appreciation of this that I reviewed the first episode on my blog at the Guardian\u2019s website. It is a welcome counterbalance to the many other documentaries that touch on history of science. Usually fronted by scientists rather than historians of science, they often focus on heroic individuals and great discoveries and too often prefer to maintain a neat, triumphalist story than to take on board the experts\u2019 more nuanced or less positive accounts. Although not deliberately contrasting with the superficially similar Science Britannica, fronted by physicist Brian Cox and broadcast on BBC2 from 18 September to 2 October 2013, Jardine clearly puts forward the historian\u2019s preferred version. It is about collaboration not lone geniuses, about more ordinary skills and talents as well as the extraordinary, and about the contexts and wider culture that shape science rather than the insistence that it is simply curiosity-driven science and technology that \u2018changed the world\u2019.\nAlthough the voices of scientists and science writers become more prominent than those of historians over the course of the series, Jardine is in control of the message of the whole (although it would have been interesting to hear some of the historian contributors commenting on \u2018Age of Now\u2019). Given that the series is so clearly historical it seems strange that this, like most other history-of-science documentaries, is presented only as science broadcasting. The BBC website categorises the series as \u2018Science &amp; Nature\u2019 and not \u2018History\u2019, when presumably the online environment means it could easily be tagged as both. It seems a missed opportunity not to suggest to those interested in history documentaries that they might enjoy this too, particularly as at least part of Jardine\u2019s message is aimed at those who might usually be uninterested in science.\nThe overarching narrative is, indeed, prompted by Jardine\u2019s insistence that the concerns of scientists are \u2018the concerns of us all\u2019 (Episode 7). It shows the context in which scientific knowledge is produced, in part to say that scientists are no different from ourselves and that science is shaped by the concerns of the time and place in which it happens, but also to convince us to pay attention to and have opinions about what science is done today. In the story of how modern science and the scientific career assumed their current shape, Jardine\u2019s particular concern is that science is viewed as separate and, taking place in locations that are out of the public gaze, has been made mysterious. She insists that, even in the \u2018Age of Now\u2019 and whatever the assumptions or appearances, science is by no means a separate sphere and that it is, as ever, defined by politics, broader culture and the interests of those who can afford to pay for it. The science of today is a product of all the previous ages, with its questions as always defined by current needs, desires and problems. Her suggestion that citizen science projects and open-access publishing may allow wider involvement \u2018once more\u2019 seems over optimistic, but the call for widening participation, and sources of funding, is welcome.\nDespite there being no lone geniuses, there are plenty of featured individuals. Although many of them are the usual suspects (Hooke, Herschel, Banks, Watt, Davy, Faraday, Maxwell, Crick), there are other less well-known names (Thomas Tompion, James Keir, Thomas Beddoes, Lise Meitner and Dorothy Hodgkin being just a few examples). Jardine and Buckley early made a decision to ensure they featured a significant number of women, both as contributors and as subjects. Finding the former, happily, proved simple according to Jardine, and women make up a high proportion of the expert voices, but it is inevitably a more difficult business to bring women into accounts of pre-20th-century science. Mary Anning is there but, for the period before women began to have educational opportunities, they are otherwise more typically present as members of the Royal Institution audience. It is to be celebrated that this aspect of science has so radically changed.\nWhatever the story, we get a sense of Jardine\u2019s personal enthusiasm. It may not be scholarly, but having heroes and favourites works well in a radio programme. The interaction between Jardine and her expert contributors is also a pleasure to hear, sounding like real conversation and giving a sense of the moment. This is reinforced by recording on location, whether at the Royal Society (where we almost feel as if we too can see Hooke\u2019s Micrographia - see Figure 3), the Natural History Museum, the Wedgwood Museum, the \u2018super-size scientific instrument\u2019 that is the Monument (Episode 1) (see Figure 4) or the \u2018little gem\u2019 (Episode 2) that is the Chelsea Physic Garden. As well as an auditory change \u2013 echoes, conversation sparked by things physically there before the speakers \u2013 the locations often mean bringing in the voices of curators and their expertise. Above all, being on location emphasises the fact that place, space and material objects matter in science.\nIt is wonderful to have this series as a permanent resource, which I will be encouraging my students to download. The internet, of course, allows for more than just storage of the original broadcasts. Jardine joined Twitter (@ProfLisaJardine) around the time that the series was broadcast, which gave the opportunity for discussion and led to history-of-science blogger Thony Christie interviewing her about the process of making the programmes \u2013 this can be read on his Wordpress site. He posed some interesting questions about the creative process and the relationship between the writer/presenter, producer, experts and BBC editors. Jardine admitted that she and Buckley had \u2018some stupendous fights in the course of brainstorming each programme\u2019, as well as agreements and breakthroughs, so that, despite some editorial diktats, \u2018these programmes are \u2013 as I believe all the best intellectual products are \u2013 the outcome of really strenuous thinking, researching and debating between two of us\u2019. All of which was, we might think, well worth the effort."},

Prior to this nationalised system early twentieth-century healthcare provision was through private funding, charitable trusts, and health insurance schemes. Medical and optical services were offered on a localised basis, availability varied according to geographical location, and the level of service was linked to the financial status of the patients. The National Health Insurance Act of 1911 had established an insurance scheme that allowed those in employment to make financial contributions towards health care and provision in case of unemployment.[8] This scheme covered the fees for a panel doctor, maternity, convalescence or sick pay. Ophthalmic aid was not included until 1923, when the Approved Societies who administered the Act had a substantial cash surplus and funded eye examinations and offered a grant for corrective eyewear.[9] This grant would cover a free pair of \u2018utility\u2019 spectacles, but with an option to pay the difference for a more expensive frame. This extension of the National Health Insurance scheme in 1923 to cover optical benefit provided the optical world with a problem. As there was no statutory recognition of optical qualifications or register of opticians it was unclear who could or should provide benefits. A new body was established from three optical associations: the British Optical Association (BOA), the Spectacle Makers Company (SMC), and the Institute of Ophthalmic Opticians (IOO); they joined together to form the Joint Council of Qualified Opticians (JCQO). The BOA and the SMC were examining bodies that offered diplomas, whereas the IOO had a strong branch system throughout Britain and close links with the refraction hospitals (eye hospitals) (Smith, 1996, pp 11\u201315). Between them these organisations represented a large proportion of the optical practitioners. The JCQO brought together all qualified ophthalmic opticians, created an ethical code, and formed the first register of practitioners. The JCQO also selected and approved the range of \u2018utility\u2019 spectacle frames available under the National Insurance scheme (see Figures 4 and 5). Despite measures taken by the JCQO regarding representation and qualification, there were expressions of discontent and the problem of registration of opticians remained an issue of concern to the profession.[10]\nFor those patients who did not contribute to an insurance scheme there were other outlets to obtain optical appliances. Spectacles could be bought at chemists, through untrained retail opticians (who were not optometrists), and from certain department stores and mail-order catalogues.[11] During the Second World War the optical profession worked to provide vision aids for servicemen and spectacles for wear with gasmasks, and although NHI frames were described as \u2018utility\u2019, government records do not show any explicit links in the optical profession to the strategies of the British Utility Design Scheme introduced by the Board of Trade as part of wartime austerity measures."},

In this latest offering from the Museum, as part of its ongoing masterplan for redevelopment, visitors are treated to three floors of science and technology, in many cases shown through the lens of Scottish contributions to the field. This local focus provides an additional layer of interest and gives the galleries an edge that this collection is uniquely placed to achieve. Located at the opposite side of the Museum to the Natural World galleries, which opened in 2011, the same attention to modern relevance and simplicity of section grouping has been applied to the science, technology and medicine collections. This makes for an experience that is appealing for a broad range of visitors, regardless of their original motivation for visiting the Museum. Some may have come for the Natural History or Scottish History galleries, but then visited the Science and Technology galleries.Overall the galleries consist of six distinct sections: two on the first floor, two on the third floor, and two on the fifth floor (see Figure 1 below). The overarching aim of the whole is to demonstrate the ways in which various scientific and technological inventions have changed our lives, from Joseph Black\u2019s work on chemistry to Stephen Salter\u2019s work on wave power; from William Hedley\u2019s work on steam locomotives to David Gow\u2019s work on articulated prosthetic limbs. Each of the six main sections is introduced by a text panel, and by reading each one it becomes clear that problem-solving is an overarching theme. The Museum team have gone back to basics to ask what problems scientists and engineers have been responding to when they have worked to develop the instruments and devices on display here.\nArranging a varied collection such as this, spanning several hundred years of innovation, in a joined-up manner across three floors was always going to be challenging. NMS has managed this difficult task by creating sections which act as stand-alone case studies and, when viewed as a whole, form a cohesive group with more and more connections becoming obvious the longer one spends here. This results in visitors being free to create their own routes through the galleries. There are no predetermined or even suggested routes or chronologies. While this has made providing guided tours challenging for some front-of-house staff, it does give the visitor greater autonomy over their experience. It also means that repeat visitors can experience the galleries differently on successive visits. There is far more to see than could possibly be achieved in just one visit and yet each display has been carefully created so that even if you see just one section you will leave having seen some new objects, or new comparison of objects. For those visitors familiar with Scottish history, the aim is clearly for them to leave with an increased understanding of how these developments relate to Scottish culture and identity while for those unfamiliar with Scottish history the aim is clearly for them to leave with a better understanding of Scotland\u2019s contribution to science, technology and medicine. These aims very much tie in with the mission of the National Museum of Scotland \u2013 a sign near the entrance states that the Museum\u2019s 200 years of collecting has been conducted in order to show Scotland to the world and the world to Scotland, an aim which has certainly been achieved in the new Science and Technology galleries where Scottish and international ideas and objects are brought together.The objects chosen for display have been arranged thematically over the three allocated floors. Each floor consists of two sections with, in most cases, catchy one-word names that both capture the content and appeal to the visitor by inviting them to share the experience. In the Explore section, for example, visitors can do just that while seeing how others have explored various scientific problems. In each section there is a display case which has been designed to be updated regularly. On the first floor are the Explore and Making It sections. While the Museum\u2019s website describes these as family-friendly displays, which they are, they in no way exclude the independent adult visitor. The many big-draw objects on display in the Explore section, such as Dolly the Sheep (now a museum classic rather than a dated example of contemporary science), the Wylam Dilly steam locomotive, not to mention three Sir Jackie Stewart Formula One cars, tick many of the boxes which make for an engaging museum experience. They draw on the familiar, are visually striking and most importantly are displayed alongside other objects which can help tell new stories about them. I enjoyed seeing Wylam Dilly displayed next to a working model of maglev technology and observed visitors stepping back and looking at the two together, commenting that the steam locomotive would have been cutting edge in its day. Connections like this might be obvious to historians and museum professionals, but cannot always be taken for granted when communicating to visitors using objects and small display labels. These same visitors may not have made the same observations if the locomotive was displayed in isolation.\nBy far my favourite section of the new galleries was Making It where the focus is on manufacturing and the process of making. The museum team decided to exploit a busy space that visitors would be in already, to see Dolly the Sheep or the Formula One cars, and present them with a story that they may not otherwise have taken the time to see. Traditionally, science and technology museums have concentrated on explaining how instruments and technologies work, but there is increasing interest by historians, museum professionals and visitors alike in how such devices were made and who made them.[1] In this section, as with the three galleries as a whole, the focus is on the local context and Making It showcases stories of historic and contemporary manufacturing in Scotland.\nOf the numerous sub-themes within the section, one is exchangeability of parts in the process of mass production. The key object is a car made by Argyll Motor Works in Dunbartonshire. The label states that it is one of Scotland\u2019s greatest manufacturing stories. Founded in 1899, employing 1,300 people, and turning out 800 cars per annum, this was the largest car production output in Europe at the time. The story of car manufacture is given depth by the other objects displayed nearby. Situated behind the car is a Bradford lathe that was used at the Argyll factory and, as the label indicates, was an essential tool for mass production. Cleverly displayed, behind glass but retaining proximity for close viewing, and with enough space to walk entirely around it, this display, complete with push-button capacity to see the chuck that holds the workpiece turning, brings the lathe to life and is far more effective than displays where lathes are hidden at the back of display cases and only comprehensible to people that have had experience in using them. Next to this is a display of other tools, from drill bits to plugs and gauges, which were used in the mass production process \u2013 all displayed as sets of differing but standardised, interchangeable parts.Audience research during the planning stages of the new gallery project demonstrated that visitors wanted to see a return of push-button interactivity. Staff have responded to this request and made it part of their narrative. Rather than a series of push-button models to show various types of machine tools, examples have been carefully selected and relate to the key objects through the galleries, as in the case of the car and lathe.From the beginning of the planning process, staff were determined to ensure contemporary relevance in order to provide additional interest, but more crucially an additional layer of relevance for visitors, alongside the relevance provided by the local connections. One of the contemporary contributions in Making It, and my personal favourite object, is an industrial robot, made by KUKA Robotics and winner of a Red Dot design award in 2013, which is designed to cooperate with human workers without the need for safety barriers. A key object for the sub-theme of automation in manufacturing within the gallery, the robot is intriguingly displayed as a working object, a bright orange arm which moves and extends with programmed regularity. The intrinsic industrial beauty created by this display is enhanced by the lighting and associated gallery audio. A piece of techno music was commissioned to give a background impression of manufacture and industrial processes and the movement of the robotic arm has been programmed to correspond in part with the music. I liked this connection, made between working object and sound: unfortunately, on the day I visited the gallery was so busy I couldn't hear it very clearly. (The use of sound in museums and galleries remains both challenging and exciting \u2013 see articles by J Rich and J Mansell in this issue). Overall, this issue is testament to how successful the team have been in encouraging people to visit a display that they might not have intended to had it not been for its strategic location next to the Explore section where Dolly the Sheep is displayed.\nSituated to one side of the robot is a nineteenth-century Jacquard loom, which I felt represented a tidy juxtaposition of old and new; wood and metal, demonstrating that humans have been working alongside machines for some time with the robot just the most recent iteration. I also thought the potential for inspiration it produced for either art students or visiting artists was subtle, but cleverly achieved. This was not made explicit in any of the gallery text, but was clear to me as a Curator who would also look for ways to make content appealing to different audiences. Finding beauty in industrial technology and processes is by no means new, but it continues to fascinate many people. On a smaller scale the NMS example is reminiscent of the message conveyed by staff at the V\u00f6lklingen Ironworks museum in Germany[2], which provides an entire decommissioned site to explore the theme of industry as beauty. On the other side of the robot, and forming an intellectual bridge between the Making It and Explore sections, is a 3D-printing machine and various examples of 3D-printed objects, including an iconic Lewis Chessman, which provides a subtle link to the Scottish History galleries nearby.Situated one floor up, on the third floor, are the Technology by Design and Communicate sections. Whereas the ground floor gallery is described as family-friendly, the pace intentionally slows a little here, as it continues to do as the visitor moves up the levels. I really enjoyed moving along the different case-study displays in the Technology by Design section \u2013 from lighthouses to bridge construction and from ship models to prosthetics. Local and contemporary relevance is provided in the bridge construction case which tells the story of the Forth Bridge and also includes a model of the new Queensferry Crossing bridge due to open in 2017. Connections between floors are evident throughout the galleries. One of these is the connection made between the experimental science in the floor above and ship models, where an experimental ship model made by Robert Wilson is displayed within the array on this floor. Wilson\u2019s model was a hybrid of paddle and propeller power created in order to observe which method was most effective.On this floor there is a display case designed to be regularly updated, which currently contains a display of prosthetics. The case demonstrates a new collecting area for the curatorial team, made possible by this gallery project. In keeping with the inclusion of objects of contemporary relevance, located nearby is a prosthetic hand with articulated fingers and thumb, the i-limb hand which was made by David Gow who pioneered the Edinburgh Modular Arm System (EMAS). Visitors can use a digital screen on the outside of the display case and click on different hand positions to operate the fingers. The update case also features a digital screen which provides three stories of different people\u2019s experiences of prosthetics \u2013 one of which is a person who was offered different devices but did not want to use them, chosen to offer a balanced view of the subject area and to show visitors some potentially unexpected viewpoints.The Communicate section takes the visitor back to the basics of communication \u2013 starting from the premise that communication takes place between two people, regardless of the device used. From this point the visitor can then compare the various technologies and contexts by which, and in which, communication happens. At first glance this might seem a simple idea, but is a very effective device that invites different comparisons of objects of communication. One context is the military one and visitors can compare a carrier pigeon with various types of radios and an Enigma machine. Another is the personal communication context, and a display of mobile phones used in Pakistan is reminiscent of the Information Age gallery at the Science Museum in London, which showcases a mobile phone stall from Cameroon. Both galleries demonstrate that some communities experienced mobile technology before landlines, which many visitors find surprising as it is very different from their own experience. Another context of use is communication with oil rigs from the mainland, providing a link with the Energise section on the floor above.As the visitor ascends the gallery floors, the pace continues to slow and the fifth floor gallery, containing the Enquire and Energise sections, is intended to provide a quieter space for visitors to contemplate the case studies presented. However, there are still opportunities for interactivity such as the big-draw activity of the giant hamster wheel in the Energise section.In the Enquire section there are various examples of scientists asking questions about the natural world or the human body. An eye-catching subsection is the particle physics case study where visitors can see a copper cavity that was used in the Large Electron Positron collider (LEP) at CERN from 1989 to 1995. The LEP was closed in 2000 to make way for the construction of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in the same tunnel. Moving along through the gallery, the visitor comes to a presentation on chemistry and is treated to a fine display of Joseph Black\u2019s laboratory glassware from the eighteenth century. Again, I found the juxtaposition of old and new to be an effective device in this gallery for making links between scientific objects and endeavours, separated by time, but connected by the shared aim of problem-solving, which is in keeping with the overarching aim of the new galleries. Highlighting Joseph Black\u2019s chemical work at the Universities of Glasgow and Edinburgh provides yet another example of Scotland\u2019s contribution to the history of science at the global level. These galleries could have provided more of a generic history of science timeline, but by concentrating on the local context and how this contributed to larger-scale developments they have played to the strength of their collections.\nThe optics display further along provides some opportunities for interactivity including some well-positioned replicas such as a zoetrope, identical to one in a nearby case, which visitors can turn themselves and look through to see the apparent moving image. A small arrangement of several different types of microscope offers an opportunity for visitors to pause and reflect. On each floor there are similar opportunities to take a break and enjoy a small array of beautifully displayed objects. The display case on this floor that is designed to be regularly updated currently features different types of medical imaging device, which provides a smooth link to the optics display. A key object here is an OPTOS machine for looking at the eye complemented by a neighbouring digital screen with video of the inventor speaking about it. Nearby is a \u2018Pedoscope\u2019 X-ray machine. These devices were used during the mid-twentieth century to measure feet in shoe shops and were eventually discontinued as they were found to be dangerous to the health not only of customers, but to staff, who operated them every day and thus received large accumulative doses of radiation. This machine has been selected to show that solutions to problems are not always successful and are often discontinued or superseded. This display also provides a connection to the prosthetics case in the Technology by Design section on the floor below.The biggest visual draw in the Energise section is the giant hamster wheel where visitors can find out how much energy they can generate by walking or running in the wheel. Renewable energy is the main focus of this section and is a subject particularly relevant for Scotland given the diversity and rapid change in the sector there. Alongside the interactivity of the wheel, different case studies are presented including oil rig decommission, nuclear power station decommission, and the growth of the wave-energy and wind power sectors. Finally, returning to the galleries as a whole, the strongest aspect of the displays in my opinion was the variety of connections that it was possible to make between objects and stories. Some stories were made explicit to visitors through object labels, such as the subsection on interchangeability of parts described above. In other instances, there were more subtle connections made through the use of space. Lines of sight, for example, are very important in this very open structure and subtly help to make connections between objects on different floors, which inevitably encourage visitors to investigate. The connections are not made explicit in gallery text and are left for the more curious of visitors to discover on their own. For the designer of the gallery it was important to keep in mind that visitors look outwards from a gallery and not just at the objects in cases that are presented to them. Indeed, visits to the upper floors have increased by 23 per cent since the redevelopment, which I imagine must in part be due to these visible connections between objects and stories, or at least the lure of intriguing-looking objects just visible through a gap in the railings or behind one of the airplanes as you look up. In the central atrium between floors, visitors are treated to the tried and tested wow-factor created by suspended aircraft, which never fails to please. From one point of view visitors can look down from a Spitfire through to the Making It section on the first floor, where a Ferranti milling machine which was used to make gunsights for Spitfires in Edinburgh during the Second World War is displayed. This is a further example of the connection, made explicit throughout the galleries as a set, of the importance of knowing the local, Scottish contribution to a subject of global importance such as increased industrialisation, aircraft development and the world wars.\nAllowing for explicit and more subtle connections required dramatic rethinking of content from what was displayed before. Rethinking the content for the new galleries enabled the team to acquire new objects and build new areas of the collection, in addition to bringing objects out of storage. Proportionately, one third of the presented objects are old favourites that were on display in the former galleries, but have been rethought; one third were previously in storage and had not been seen by many visitors; and the final third are new acquisitions. The idea to include a display case in each gallery that will be regularly updated provides freshness and a degree of flexibility not always available to permanent galleries. The content of the update cases on the day I visited related nicely to the neighbouring displays, which meant that they didn\u2019t appear as an add-on or after-thought. I enjoyed the digital interpretation, which was used sparingly but effectively. Unfortunately some of the digital interpretation panels were either not working or were slow in loading on the day I visited. However, this is no different from most other museums and is a testament to how popular and well-used they are. Digital interpretation has provided additional connections to be made; the interview with someone who chose to not use a prosthetic in close proximity to the prosthetics case is just one example. Text panels and labels throughout the gallery were accessible to most visitors, achieving a good balance between capturing the necessary information and remaining succinct. Personally I would have liked to see accession numbers for individual objects so that I could have looked up my favourites later, but these were not present on object labels. Not displaying accession numbers creates a potential barrier to research and visitor enquiries regarding particular objects, so I think the displays could be improved if these were to be added in future.Each section of the galleries was extremely busy on the day I visited with a range of visitors spanning the generations \u2013 a testament to the work of the Museum team who have made the content appealing to a broad audience. The ways in which the Museum team layered the connections (old and new, global and local, to name just two) and conveyed these in different ways (through the placing of objects, both close-by and further away, and by the selective use of digital interpretation) clearly enabled different visitors to find meanings that resonated for them. I would recommend a visit to these galleries, which bring a fresh perspective to some familiar history of science, technology and medicine stories, reveal some new ones and make many new connections."},

It nonetheless capitalised upon the widely perceived superiority of Italian vocal tones as a musical ideal within the operatic profession. According to the Victorian meteorologist Thomas Gilbert Bowick, Italy had \u2018longed been famed as the cradle of song and the birthplace of many of our sweetest singers and grandest musicians\u2019 (Bowick, 1884, p 76).[2] The great superiority \u2018both in execution and numbers of the singers of the Schools of Italy over the rest of Europe\u2019 was explicitly noted in the Encyclopaedia Metropolitana; Or, Universal Dictionary of Knowledge in 1845 (although, like many others, the author noted that this had been somewhat in decline in recent decades) and it was a sentiment that was echoed across the musical and general press (Gwilt, 1845, p 712). As Richard Taruskin has shown in his detailed study of music in the nineteenth century, since the rise of German instrumental music, \u2018Italian musicians were happy to divide the musical world into spheres of influence: the vocal, where their superiority was unassailable (and which they regarded as the higher sphere as it was one that the human organism could produce \u201cnaturally\u201d, without mediation), and the instrumental)\u2019 to which the German musicians were welcome (Taruskin, 2009, p 618). Italy was regarded, above all, as a nation redolent in melodic charm. With a marked preference for melody and rhythm over harmony, the Italians, declared the Hungarian baritone Albert Bach in a lecture at the Edinburgh Music Hall in 1882, were \u2018before other nations endowed with a lively sense of form and colour, of symmetry and beauty, and especially, with a sense of beautiful sound\u2019 (Bach, 1883, p 224). The renowned Hungarian composer and virtuoso musician Franz Liszt had also reputedly noted that just \u2018as esprit is said to hover about the streets in Paris, so in Italy happily invented melodies are, so to speak, in the air; they insinuate themselves incidentally, and pleasingly coax the ear\u2019 (Bach, 1883, p 226). Music and the bountiful Italian atmosphere were equally synonymous in other cultural forms, as Phyllis Weliver\u2019s compelling discussion of the influence of climate on racial development, language, and musical semiotics in the works of the English novelist George Meredith has demonstrated (Weliver, 2006, pp 83\u2013109). In his \u2018Fra Lippo Lippi\u2019 (1855), the English poet Robert Browning similarly presented Italy as a dynamic, lively, and artistic nation where, when the poem\u2019s speaker opens his window, the very air is infused with \u2018a sweep of lute strings, laughs, and whifts of song\u2019 (Browning, 2007, p 630). The association between the nation of Italy and the heights of musical beauty was undoubtedly profound in the popular consciousness, and the Italian air was understood to resonate with the beautiful melodies of its people. The precise location of that musical talent, however, be it atmospheric, meteorological, cultural, social, or biological, was a matter for ongoing debate.Moffat was convinced that there was something peculiar to the air of Italy that accounted for the superiority of Italian vocal tones, and his views were enthusiastically endorsed by Bowick, a Fellow of the Royal Meteorological Society who wrote in his essay of 1884 that in Italy, the \u2018balmy perfume-laden air, the lovely autumnal tints of grassy slopes, the foliage of the olive and the broad palmate leaf of the vine all combine in appealing to the student of Nature, of Science, and of Art.\u2019 The Ammoniaphone was, for Bowick at least, the material embodiment of that inspirational atmosphere, and one had simply to inhale its essence so that, \u2018by means of [Moffat\u2019s] Chemical Science we are brought into a Fairy land of which no one knows the extent\u2019 (Bowick, 1884, p 79). Its effects were, in this paradigm, akin to magic in their defiance of biologically imposed limitations. The fact that the application for a patent for the Ammoniaphone was made by \u2018Robert Carter Moffat, chemist, and Thomas Gilbert Bowick, manufacturer\u2019 did, of course, rather undercut the value of his praise, and many musicians, scientists and medical professionals with an interest in music remained highly sceptical (Browne, 1884, p 21). In November 1884, the editors of the Tonic Sol-Fa Reporter noted that several correspondents had already written to solicit the magazine\u2019s opinion on the Ammoniaphone, and \u2018we can only say that we tried it the other day, and that the inhalation had not the slightest effect on our voice\u2019 (1884a, p 383). One surgeon\u2019s letter to the editor of the Lancet in February 1884 raised two objections to Moffat\u2019s theory: first, that English pupils studying in Italy did not experience the remarkable effects which Moffat claimed for Italian air, and secondly, that Italian vocalists in England did not lose their vocal superiority when removed from the influence of their supposedly \u2018musical atmosphere\u2019 (White, 1884, p 327). Dr Andrew Wilson, quoting this letter in his magazine Health, noted that \u2018this looks like sensible criticism, and suggests that, after all, race-peculiarity, and not peroxide of hydrogen, lies at the root of Italian purity of song\u2019 (Williams, 1884, p 405). The editors of the Magazine of Music concurred that beyond the vocal mechanism itself lay the Italian tendency to song, which was a geographical and a \u2018racial phenomenon\u2019 that required the broader analysis of a \u2018mass of carefully collated facts\u2019 by a sociologist like Herbert Spencer, and could not be explained by \u2018mere analysis of atmospheres\u2019 (1885a, p 34).By referencing Spencer here, the magazine\u2019s editors are deliberately seeking to undercut the notion that superior singing is merely the result of atmospheric influences by alluding to increasingly popular Victorian debates about the origins and the evolution of music, and thus implying that there are rather more complex biological and sociological factors at work than can be captured in a simple metal tube. In contrast to Charles Darwin\u2019s earlier claims that human ancestors had uttered musical sounds before they had acquired powers of articulate speech, Herbert Spencer\u2019s controversial 1857 article, \u2018The Origin and Function of Music\u2019, had rigorously set forth the principle that music\u2019s origins lay in speech, and more specially, in the primitive language of human emotions. Spencer\u2019s central premise was that \u2018there is a physiological relation between feeling and vocal sounds; that all the modifications of voice expressive of feeling are the direct results of this physiological relationship\u2019 (Spencer, 1857, p 49). That is, vocal sounds originally occurred through the agency of the human muscles as they contracted and relaxed in accordance with the sensations of pleasure or pain, releasing sounds whose pitch, timbre, and intervals varied in response to the emotional experiences that prompted them.[3] According to Spencer, then, music was an extension of natural physiological phenomena, and less evolved races therefore produced less evolved and far more basic music:\nThat music is a product of civilisation is manifest: for though some of the lowest savages have their dance-chants, these are of a kind scarcely to be signified by the title musical: at most they supply but the vaguest rudiment of music so properly called. (Spencer, 1857, p 69)\nEmploying Spencer\u2019s argument in response to Moffat\u2019s claims provided a strident rebuttal of the very conception of the Ammoniaphone. A simple chemical formula for the improvement of the voice could not bestow the kind of lyrical impulse and highly evolved aesthetic sensitivity required to produce great music. Albert Bach later elaborated upon this concept in his lectures in Edinburgh, declaring that \u2018Orientals sing no better when they live in our climate. They are wanting in culture and taste, otherwise they might sing with as clear and beautiful a tone as the Italian\u2019 (Bach, 1883, p 207). He went on to draw a comparison between the infant-like, rudimentary singing of \u2018uncivilised people\u2019 and the \u2018taste for music\u2019 which is evidenced in early childhood before the \u2018power of attention to words\u2019. \u2018Men in an uncivilised state\u2019, Bach insisted, \u2018do not sing as civilised Europeans do: even in the best climate they will roar\u2019 (Bach, 1883, p 209). It was therefore of the utmost importance that the singer continually strive after intellectual refinement through the study of classical works and intercourse with people of great culture and character, for \u2018the vocal organ, the larynx, cannot express anything not already realised in the mind\u2019 (Bach, 1883, p 214).In Bach\u2019s paradigm, a cultured voice, as opposed to the utterances of that organ in its natural state, was the result of sophisticated intellectual impulses aided by the imagination. Climate, however, was generally understood to affect the richness and softness of the vocal tones of those already civilised, intellectual and emotionally mature European peoples in various ways. Mild climates allowed men and women to spend a greater amount of time outdoors, where, as the American minister and educator Theodore Emanuel Schmauk argued in his 1890 study of The Voice in Speech and Song, their voices were not liable to be damaged by raw and excessively cold external atmospheres or the corresponding overheated and dry interiors. In such an environment, they might constantly exercise their vocal cords and perfect their vocal tones. In Schmauk\u2019s view, the warm air of the Mediterranean, rather than the chemicals contained within it, was a major contributor both to the national character and lifestyle:\nThe influence of climate, through personality, upon the voice, is somewhat similar to the influences of climate, through the personality of the composer, upon the tones of melody. In warm climates we may expect the voice to be expressive of languor and love, of sweet and tender melancholy. In cold climates we may look for notes of storm, and ruggedness and battle and conquest. In temperate climes, there should be life and grace. The Frenchman\u2019s tones should be short, piquant, airy and gay. The German\u2019s, broad, slow, reverential. The Italian\u2019s, voluptuous and melodic. The Englishman\u2019s, positive, stubborn, formal. (Schmauk, 1890, pp 99\u2013100)\nAlbert Bach, too, similarly theorised that the warm climate and extended periods of time outdoors encouraged Italians to open their mouths more frequently and more widely than, for example, many inhabitants of England and Scotland, where cold, damp air induced a habitual closure of the mouth and rendered the tone of the voice close and obscure. A warm environment also, Bach noted, naturally influenced choices of food and drink, allowing Italians to live on a mainly vegetarian diet without the need for strong drink (which was damaging to the vocal cords) to artificially excite warmth. Moreover, the Italian climate created rich soil \u2018yielding everything in great profusion with but little labour, that materially contributes towards the formation of the national character\u2019 by fostering the supposedly famous dolce far niente, the \u2018sweet doing-nothing\u2019, of the Italian race who, free from the exhausting demands typically made of the labourer in northern climes, might readily conceive the notion that they \u2018may exist for something better than for spending his life in constant drudgery and a kind of torment\u2019 (Bach, 1883, pp 220\u2013221). Such freedoms while surrounded by the \u2018serene deep-blue sky, the magnificent charming tints of the landscape, the striking outlines of her mountain-ranges [\u2026] and her lovely luxuriant valleys\u2019, which were understood to everywhere surround the Italian citizen, must necessarily exercise a beneficent influence upon both body and mind, thereby fostering that elated and passionate engagement with life that Bach believed defined the Italian character (Bach, 1883, p 222). Ultimately, Bach declared, due to the good fortune of residing within a temperate climate and enchanting landscape, \u2018people so demonstrative as the Italians have at most hours of the day something at heart that would fain be out\u2019 (Bach, 1883, p 222). Music offered an ideal medium for which to release this passion.Interestingly, in 1885, as part of their marketing campaign, the Medical Battery Company published a song by Alfred Benjamin Allen and Percy G Moccata entitled \u2018The Lost Voice: A Refrain on Dr Carter Moffat\u2019s Ammoniaphone\u2019, which drew upon these same associations between Italy, music, a passionate engagement with life, and the need to express that passion. In this song, a lovesick young man has lost his voice and is therefore unable to tell his beloved that his heart belongs to her. There is, however, some cause for hope:\nAh! Well for him and for the fair,He\u2019d heard that pure Italian airMight be inhal\u2019d, imparting toneThro\u2019 Moffat\u2019s fam\u2019d Ammoniaphone! (Allen and Moccata, 1885, p 4)\nThe young man purchases the device and upon using it, he regains his voice and immediately proposes to the young woman \u2018in such tones\u2019 that she immediately accepts his suit. The song then crescendos to a jubilant final refrain:\nTen thousand times be bless\u2019d the sage,Great benefactor of the age!Restorer of his vocal tone:Inventor of th\u2019 Ammoniaphone! (Allen and Moccata, 1885, pp 6\u20137)\nIt seems that not only did the Ammoniaphone provide a simple means of achieving the tones of an Italian opera singer, but, in the context of this advertising, it was also a potential source of requited love and of that passionate, demonstrative personality supposedly characteristic of the warm-blooded Italian race. The Ammoniaphone transformed that personality and its associated lifestyle into an easily attainable scientific and medical commodity. Good health and sonorous voices were simply products to be purchased like any other.\u00a0"},

As skilled tradesmen, they orchestrated, but also partially hid from view, the efforts of the workmen they employed, and the networks of manufacturing trades, such as foundries and glass-makers, that crisscrossed the city (Millburn, 2000; McConnell, 2007; Baker, 2010; Bennett, 2007). As authors of books and designers of instruments, they participated in the production and consumption of print, and in a community of readers that tended to be elite, learned and international (Bennett, 2002). The materials they worked with, such as brass and mahogany, flowed into and through London with different tempos and geographical ranges; the books that for Adams proved most commercially useful had their own, distinctive trajectories as well (see Figure 1).\nThe mobility of print and the situated nature of skilled, material production have both played pivotal roles in accounts of the development of experimental science (Eisenstein, 1979; Smith, 2004). Steven Shapin and Simon Schaffer (1985) have provided one influential model for thinking about how natural philosophers of the 17th century sought to extend the epistemic range of local, material processes of making instruments and experiments, through techniques of rhetoric and composition, and the circulation of printed books and periodicals. In a gentlemanly culture in which determining the truth about experience was profoundly linked to the testimony of reliable witnesses, Robert Boyle (1627\u201391) and other fellows of the early Royal Society developed ways of writing experimental accounts that recruited their readers as \u2018virtual witnesses\u2019 to new experimental phenomena (Shapin and Schaffer, 1985, p 60). The question of how reading and other ways of consuming print fed into practices of making \u2013 whether of experiments or of instruments \u2013 is of equal interest, though perhaps less well explored (Johns, 2003).\nCollections held by the Science Museum shed important light on how, in the more commercial and socially diverse culture of 18th-century experimental philosophy, an instrument-maker such as Adams might use books in the conduct of his trade. Adams\u2019s ways of exploiting print in the production of instruments were informed by widespread practices such as commonplacing (see section 'Instruments for The King, 1761-62', below) and physical cutting and pasting (see section 'Instruments for The King, 1761-62', below), through which tradesmen often adapted pattern books; and by contemporary attitudes to creativity and innovation, which were framed in terms of \u2018imitation\u2019, \u2018improvement\u2019 and \u2018invention\u2019 (Adams, 1747a, p 244) (see section 'Instruments for The King, 1761-62', below). Over his lifetime, Adams turned to his own use many works by natural philosophers of the late 17th and early 18th century. As Adrian Johns has shown, these men had sought to exercise maximum control over all aspects of the production of their books, thereby jealously guarding their reputations as truthful and reliable authors (Johns, 1998). Adams\u2019s practices of commonplacing, excerpting, rearranging and unauthorised translating were activities which these earlier authors saw as threats to the stability of knowledge itself (Johns, 1998, p 33). Adams\u2019s repeated use of such techniques drew accusations of plagiarism from his business rivals, such as Henry Baker (1698\u20131774), author of The Microscope Made Easy (1742); and the instrument-maker and lecturer Benjamin Martin (bapt. 1705, d. 1782) (Browning, 1746; Martin, 1766, p 28; Millburn, 2000, pp 121\u20133). Nonetheless, these were also the productive, prolific and aggressive means by which natural philosophy, in its commercial forms, such as lectures, textbooks and instruction manuals, reached an expanding public in the 18th century."},

While the other two \u2013 the World Conference of Science Journalists and the Science Centre World Summit (for those working in hands-on science centres) \u2013 target specific sectors, PCST joins together everyone: science journalists, science museum and science centre staff, science theatre directors, artists, scholars of science communication, scientists who deal with the public, public information officers for scientific institutions and many others interested in these issues. It is a very diverse and rich environment for sharing and discussing how to engage society in science and technology.\nHeld in Salvador, Brazil, PCST 2014 was, like other PCST conferences, a science communication marathon: from the 452 proposals submitted, 342 were accepted into the programme and these were distributed across 14 parallel sessions[1]\u00a0with simultaneous translation for keynote talks.\nSince its launch in 1989, the conference has moved every two years to a different part of the globe. However, it reached Latin America for the first time only in 2014. It is not surprising, then, that 56% of the 507 science communicators from 49 countries who participated in the conference were from Latin American countries. Europe represented 26% of the participants, while other regions provided fewer delegates: for example Asia 6%, United States and Canada 5% and Africa 4%. Overall, 61% of the participants were from the developing world.\nWithout losing its international focus, the conference provided a good opportunity for discussion about what happens in science communication in this part of the world. The organisers therefore designed some of the sessions to address regional needs (including those of regions outside Latin America). In this discussion piece I will map out some aspects of science communication in Latin America, highlighting some of the challenges.\nFirst of all, it is important to remember that Latin America is a huge region of extraordinary diversity. There are social, cultural, economic and scientific differences between countries and even within the same country."},

That conference raised a number of questions: What is a museum? What made a museum? What were its precursors and comparators? How do British and American museums compare with one another? The book attempts to answer, or at least explore, these questions about the time of the emergence of professional science education by trained scientists. It also looks at science as presented in books, shows and in other entertainments. It addresses the question \u2018What is a museum?\u2019 by looking at the people who worked there. In so doing, the book is, we are told, about expertise: Who got to define what a museum was? Who could claim authorship in ordering nature? Who, in some cases, could profit from these activities? Answers included natural philosophers, collectors, showmen, experts and nations. \nPrivate museums were widely found in the first half of the nineteenth century in both Britain and the US. Initiated by entrepreneurs (Barnum is the most famous example), the commercial aspect of these spectacles sat uncomfortably with the twentieth century historiography of museums. These private enterprises were replaced by more organised, if anonymously authored, displays of grand narratives towards the end of the century. By the mid\u2013late century, museums had largely consolidated their practices, around collecting, organising, exhibiting and interpreting. Expert knowledge was presented to lay publics, often with a civilising mission linked with public education, and with civic and national identity and pride. In the introduction, Berkowitz and Lightman identify two main tracks of scholarship on the history of scientific exhibitions and museums. The first draws on popular tastes for exhibitions and scientific spectacles, drawing especially on Richard Altick\u2019s Shows of London (1978), which explored Victorian London; more recent scholars continue this vein of research, exploring all manner of magic lantern shows, electrical experiments and more. The second vein of research focuses on the development of the great museums, usually through the life lens of their champions and intellectual architects: Richard Owen (the force behind the present Natural History Museum in London) and Louis Agassiz (founder of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University) are the foremost examples. Other strands of research focus on the materiality of collections and the exchange networks that existed between museums as they each built their own collections.\nThe first section of the book, \u2018Sites of Miscellanity\u2019 is a romp through some of the pre-eminent showman shows: the London Colosseum, Barnum\u2019s American Museum and Samuel Goodrich\u2019s books. These two chapters blur the separation between science and art, and between education and entertainment. In a section on \u2018Display and expertise\u2019, Sam Alberti presents the example of the Royal College of Surgeons (London) to emphasise the connection between changes in the architecture of the museum and changes in the relationship between the museum and a variety show. Iwan Morus re-emphasises the importance of scientific showmanship, exploring the National Repository that existed briefly in Charing Cross in London, and the importance of discriminatory seeing by spectators to cultivate a scientific public.\nPart three, \u2019The Scientist-Showman\u2019 continues to explore the activities of key individuals: Jeremy Brooker explores the construction of the scientific reputation of Henry Morton, Faraday, Tyndall and others. He shows that scientific lectures in Britain and America followed similar lines and were given with a common purpose: to build and cement reputations. Morton in particular drew inspiration from the work of Tyndall and Pepper, but the great success of his lectures influenced Tyndall and Pepper\u2019s public appearances in the US. Lukas Rieppel presents the example of Albert Koch and his Hydrarchos, the fossil of what to all intents and purposes looked like a sea monster. Koch toured the US with this sea serpent. Quickly, a professional scientist (to use an anachronistic term) showed that it was not a serpent of any kind, but the skeleton of an ancestral whale. Rieppel makes the point, correctly in my view, that exhibitors were not solely concerned with drawing a profit from their spectacles, noting Barnum\u2019s various contributions towards scientific enterprises. Rieppel focuses on exploring Koch\u2019s public persona and credibility.\nPart four deals with \u2018The National Museum\u2019, in terms of displays of scientific work for the good of the nation and its industries. Pamela Henson explores G Brown Goode\u2019s vision for the United States National Museum, a \u2018nursery of living thoughts\u2019 (as opposed to a \u2018cemetery of bric-a-brac\u2019, Goode\u2019s words) for the adolescent nation, serving scientific, educational and economic needs and focusing on the various productions of the nation, and instituting many of the features we still associate with US natural history museums. Caroline Cornish discusses Kew\u2019s Economic Botany Museum, insofar as scientific knowledge was [re]produced in the Museum, and its status as a relational museum. Cornish shows how the Museum was designed to meet the needs of a number of audiences, and political\u2013scientific agendas.\nIn part five, \u2018The Research Museum\u2019, Carin Berkowitz explores scientific networks (correspondence and collecting) through the work of polymath Joseph Leidy in Philadelphia. Sally Gregory Kohlstedt\u2019s contribution is on the development of academic museums, in relation to curricula around natural history and biology. John Tresch gives an afterword returning to the various questions raised in the introduction.\nThe book is an enjoyable contribution on nineteenth century scientific spectacle and exhibition. The terms \u2018science\u2019 and \u2018natural history\u2019 are used loosely and I would have liked to have been able to better understand what those terms meant to the various key figures. While presumably unintended, the book could look like a Whig history leading \u2018from\u2019 the spectacles produced by enterprising entertainers such as Barnum \u2018to\u2019 the codified, disciplinary museums of the later nineteenth century, and it wasn\u2019t clear to me what the transition was. The suggestion that museums were primarily about public ownership of collections for the purpose of public exhibition (p 268) is too simplistic, and the \u2018space\u2019 between private, aristocratic cabinets of curiosity and encyclopaedic collections (I am reluctant to call it a trajectory) was a complex one that was negotiated over a long period. Museums were, are and probably will continue to be many things to many people, and equating museums with exhibitions oversimplifies the story. I would have liked to have seen more on how nature and natural science were presented in media beyond museums and spectacles, notably in zoos and aquaria, and the development of public parks and notions of scenic landscape, which are not featured in the collections. That said, the book is a very rich source on a wide variety of topics that would be of interest to anyone interested in the history of museums and public exhibition in the nineteenth century, and is suitable for both a general audience, and undergraduate and postgraduate students in relevant topics."},

More than fifty per cent of the UK population now visits one every year; with attendances across many western countries having grown as much as ten per cent in the last decade. During half that period, a variety of funding agencies and individuals have poured no less than five billion dollars into America\u2019s museum infrastructure, with entirely new museums (such as the Eli Broad in LA and Smithsonian\u2019s African American Museum) or hefty extensions of established ones (like that at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art) being built as a consequence. While on the other side of the planet, somewhere between two and four new Chinese museums have been set up roughly every week for the last five years; though not all of them, it seems, are full of either exhibits or visitors. Across the entire planet, it has been estimated that there were something like 23,000 museums twenty years ago, with the figure more than doubling to 55,000 today (Fiammetta Rocco, \u2018Temples of Delight,\u2019 The Economist, 21 December 2013, p 152).\nMuseums then are unmistakably gaining in both social and cultural significance. These words will no doubt sound complacently hollow and implausibly distant to those working with dwindling budgets or through drastic cuts; but it is difficult to resist a sense that we might be entering a new international museum age. This swelling of overall fortunes provides the backdrop to Nicholas Thomas\u2019 timely and rewarding The Return of Curiosity.\nHis first chapter focuses on this ascendency, characterising the shift as \u2018a kind of belated adolescence\u2019: a period during which museums have grown \u2018suddenly in fits and starts, assuming new attitudes and responsibilities, demanding and obtaining attention and money\u2019. What he lays out is a confidence-boosting depiction of an old institution discovering renewed purpose. And for those of us who have worked in the sector for a number of decades, it also provides a cheering reminder of how thoroughly museums have been saved from the cultural obsolescence that we probably recall from our early professional lives.With the benefit of hindsight it seems clear that those of us embarking on a museum career 20\u201330 years ago were joining institutions that had become stuck in the past and appeared, like cultural dinosaurs, to be approaching extinction. And for a while, it seemed that the only way to save them from being trapped by their own irrelevance was to turn to business thinking and jargon for salvation: we needed \u2013 we were told \u2013 to turn our focus away from collections and toward audiences, who were being transformed into \u2018customers\u2019. Marketing strategies were to inform programming decisions; key performance indicators and mission statements were a pre-requisite for setting out organisational aims, structures and job descriptions; and concepts of \u2018edutainment\u2019 and engagement were to replace less clearly articulated or examined, and thoroughly old-fashioned, assumptions about what museums were good for. All this suggested that the traditional role of museums might well be disappearing for good.And then, towards the end of the millennium, it became apparent that technology had got hold of a final set of nails to entomb an institution already outlasting its natural life. It was all but impossible to resist the logic that digital technologies were destined to make museums as we knew them utterly irrelevant. Swept along by strong currents of the information revolution (frankly it resembled a tsunami at times), museum leaders (not surprisingly, especially those working with science and technology collections) eagerly adopted all sorts of survival mechanisms in order to rejuvenate, or, better, reinvent the museum: digitization, electronic simulation, virtual environments, interactive exhibits, and numerous other technology-led innovations were all proffered as life-saving devices.The transformations needed, we discovered, were root-and-branch, involving dramatic exercises in rebranding, with public edifices being visibly and sometimes violently plucked from their dusty and boring origins (those were invariably the favoured adjectives), and then replanted in vibrant electronic environments. Museums should be repurposed as broadcast systems, or as walk-in electronic publications, or as film production companies (it\u2019s ironic how many of the models so beloved by excitable directors of that era, were themselves about to be threatened by the same cultural forces). In short, museums were to be anything but museums. Indeed, the name \u2018museum\u2019 itself had become a problem, which many solved by replacing with the functionally efficient sounding \u2018centre\u2019, predominantly adopted in two flavours: heritage or science.Return of Curiosity doesn\u2019t really hark back to those uncertain, less curious times; preferring to pick up the story a generation later. The world of culture has moved on, it is argued, by re-evaluating its past and reclaiming some of its institutional history. During that period at the turn of the last century, when bath water was energetically being tossed without necessarily much heed to saving babies, curiosity felt remote, irrelevant even. This perception was particularly heightened for me, since before embarking on a career in museums, I had spent years pursuing historical research on their early modern precedents: cabinets of curiosities.Nor does Thomas apply himself to understanding what cultural and social shifts might have curtailed those uncurious decades, or why museums have re-emerged as prominent and thriving (if financially precarious) features of most progressive and confident civic environments. Instead, in this long-essay of a book, he describes the new optimistic state we find ourselves in with conviction, using his training and background (both as a distinguished and creative anthropologist and historian, and as the decade-long director of Cambridge\u2019s Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology) to articulate what he sees as the point of museums now. To understand \u2018what is behind the new, almost supercharged dynamism of the sector\u2019 he draws less on accumulated evidence than on belief and experience. Fortunately his substantial track record and the wisdom he has garnered along the way enables Thomas to make a compelling and uplifting case for the power that museums have as a force for good in the twenty-first century.The issue of what role museums can and should now play is, of course, much thought about and debated, both internally and more broadly among those with the power to decide how much funding they should get from government, foundations, businesses and commerce. For the state it is perhaps an increasingly important issue because visitors (as voters) contribute through their taxes, as do too, of course, the fabled stay-aways. Answers to what effects on visitors all of these stakeholders should expect from museums invariably gesture towards a mixture of psychological, educational and sociological impacts. Some argue with passion that an effective museum can demonstrably increase the personal wellbeing of those who go (adding to their very happiness); others focus on the help they can give to educational attainment, through channels of so-called \u2018informal learning\u2019; and still others point to evidence for consequent improvements to social cohesion and tolerance. A significant source of strength in the sector comes from its diversity, and this is rightly played out in the varied nature of any given museum\u2019s value and worth.But too many of these well-meaning attempts to provide arguments for continued funding, and certainly too much of its rhetoric, unthinkingly turn museums into instruments applied to broader social aims. It\u2019s unfortunate, if understandable, that those of us who work in museums are tempted to over-sell the relevance of our work to externally set agendas. Museums, I suspect, are rather less usable than we are inclined to suggest; and their impact is very likely more mysterious than it appears. As museum philosopher Hilde Hein usefully reminds us, museums came from \u2018idle roots\u2019 that were essentially \u2018gratuitous and wondrously unencumber[ed]\u2019. What makes them important does not simply lie in their contributions to these worthwhile social agendas; and certainly what makes them distinctive is found more readily (and interestingly) in their history and intrinsic values than in any exit-survey-based evidence for their external effectiveness.Thomas wisely avoids the intricacies of the discussions and debates that swirl around such topics, choosing instead to unfold an argument that begins with the foundational philosophical precept behind the emergence of modern museums in the first place: namely the curiosity of his title. For him, this fundamental instinct is \u2018fertile and necessary, not only for people in general, but specifically for those of us alive in the twenty-first century\u2019.Though he uses it rather sparingly, another word that I kept on thinking his book extensively addressed is \u2018investigation\u2019. Maybe it sounds too serious (though not nearly as much as the word \u2018research\u2019 \u2013 the deadly serious and rather exclusive term applied in universities) but surely a return of curiosity in museums must bring with it a renewed emphasis on the basic human urge to investigate.The idea of active enquiry has, in fact, also been an essential part of the museum mission since their early-modern reinvention. It comes out of the same philosophical and social forces that compelled late-Renaissance curiosi and virtuosi to invent anatomical theatres, menageries and scientific laboratories all as places in which they could closely inspect the world around them for themselves, rather than relying on received wisdom from the \u2018ancients\u2019. One way of understanding this most recent return of curiosity then would be to see it as evidence of a broader, promiscuously democratic extension of the notion of who might properly be involved in such enquiries. Namely anyone who visits a museum, Thomas seems to suggest.So having made it clear that museums are experiencing a few good decades, and urging us to see a revitalised place for curiosity at the heart of that up-swing, Thomas sets about articulating where and how he sees it surfacing. Given his bold adherence to a rather old-fashioned word, it is perhaps not surprising that material culture is also central to his thesis. However, he is rather less concerned with a nostalgic (and fashionable) return to museums as curiosity cabinets, and rather more focused on the effect that objects have in attracting and then agitating our innate investigative spirit. For him, museums are more meaningfully thought of as cabinets for curious people than of curiosities.The value attached to things in museums waned somewhat during the last quarter century\u2019s infatuation with digital experiences. And not a few museum directors at some point wondered whether at least some of their collections could be converted into digital assets, so as to save space, money and trouble. More recently, the fortunes of this precious stuff seem to have waxed again as we re-embraced a concern for the physical, rather than just the visible. A recent New Yorker article reported that though scientific papers concerning vision outnumber those on the science of touch by fifty to one, there have nevertheless been more about the neuroscience and cellular basis of touch in the last decade than the preceding century (quoted by Alice Rawsthorn, \u2018By Design\u2019, Frieze, no. 182, October 2016, pp 57\u201359). The digital is here to stay of course, but the world\u2019s physical aspects seem also to be demanding more consideration these days. Those with philosophical inclinations have been saying something along these lines for a while, to the extent that a \u2018material turn\u2019 has been identified across the humanities. Prominent voices like those of anthropologist Daniel Miller and literary philosopher Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht have, for example, insisted on the urgency of dwelling on the materiality of things, adopting an almost fundamentalist position about the \u2018thingness of things\u2019. They argue that when it comes to things, we must resist being overly seduced by the symbolic view of their importance, and concern ourselves as much with their basic presence as their subtler meanings.Thomas, too, is keen that we think carefully about the value of being close to things \u2013 \u2018the conjuncture of intimate actuality\u2019 as he puts it. But his main point is not just to chime in with this recent chorus, but rather to offer a refined version that further encourages us to think about the collection in addition to individual objects. He\u2019s too polite to say so, but by implication he might well be suggesting that we material-culture enthusiasts have become rather obsessed with isolated things. He wants us to broaden our purview and concern ourselves further with the internal relations that are set up within a collection, because he believes \u2018the strange gathering of related stuff that constitutes the collection has a certain magic\u2019 (p 143). It\u2019s perhaps an obvious, but nonetheless important point of elaboration: objects in museums are inevitably part of a collection. In fact, most \u2018museums do not hold \u201ca collection\u201d as much as they do \u201ccollections\u201d\u2019 (p 74). So these gatherings of gatherings should not be thought of simply as amassed things \u2018susceptible to precise enumeration and definition\u2019; because with intelligent inspection and contemplation they turn out to be \u2018stranger and more surprising assemblages than we have appreciated\u2019. Similar to a nation or community then, \u2018a collection is likewise made up of complex associations, connections and representations\u2019. Above all then, collections are made of relations, and thereby take on some of the more organic qualities of life itself (pp 17, 75).Museum objects were, of course, brought into museums at some time in the past, and at that moment records and recollections of other \u2018lives\u2019 they carried from further in the past were simultaneously accessioned. But these things face the future too; they provide us with tools that can be used to do intellectual and emotional work. Thomas puts it this way: \u2018a collection is more than a historical resource; it is also something that we work with prospectively, a technology that enables the creation of new things\u2019. This is the museum as method that supplies the title of his second chapter (pp 9, 99\u2013100). In it he talks evocatively of the power of juxtaposition, which he prefers \u2018to an anodyne word such as \u201cordering\u201d or \u201cgrouping\u201d precisely because it implies a placing-side-by-side that may be argumentative, that may entail ambiguity or tension, that may take a risk\u2019 (p 110). And through this special form of associative analysis, curators are able to stage \u2018similarity, difference, progression, disruption, equivalence, hierarchy, singularity and accumulation\u2019 (pp 107, 135). The same contentious issues can, he points out, be raised on the radio as in an exhibition. But the former runs the risk of heightening tempers and sub-dividing listeners into echo chambers (as we\u2019ve recently learned to call them); while the latter is more likely to give pause for thought and reflection, \u2018because a verbal assertion and an artefact\u2019s mute oration are different in their nature and effect\u2019. Museums provide an ideal realm in which \u2018you can pursue interest and discover interests you did not know you had, not alone, but in company \u2013 that is, in the company of strangers\u2019 (pp 62\u201363). And in this way the museum becomes \u2018an apparatus that helps us \u201ccollect our thoughts\u201d\u2019.These are ideas that many of us will hazily imagine we somehow already knew; but we owe a debt of gratitude to Thomas for expressing them so eloquently and persuasively. He is surely right: continuing to apply curiosity within our institutions can help us get more from our objects than they seemed to possess when they were brought over the threshold; and collections do amount to more than just a group of things precisely because individual artefacts are entangled with and point to each other in surprising ways.Ultimately Thomas also wants us to acknowledge that what \u2018collections say to us is less important than the difference they make to who we are\u2019 (p 137). Here is the most optimistic implication of his claimed return to curiosity: the suggestion that collections have an important civic role to play because of the way they furnish us with a uniquely adept technology for applying the past to the future. This is because the type of curiosity they nurture leads to a shared awareness: \u2018Through devices of scale and address, not only contemporary works but also other sorts of museum exhibits elicit shared awareness and a common responsiveness (not necessarily a common response) from disparate people.\u2019 The curiosity promoted in museums is linked to sociality (\u2018the one prepares us for the other\u2019), so that the practice of visiting them can become a form of positive participation in civic life. Curiosity leads to connection, to sociality and finally to \u2018a readiness to encounter and acknowledge difference\u2019. In short (and despite their disappointing conservatism and seeming inability to instil direct action beyond their own walls) museums do make us more eager to encounter the unfamiliar, the different; to suspend our judgments even; and thereby to elicit from us greater empathy. Thomas\u2019 answer to the quandary of what museums are good for is that the curiosity they champion \u2018equips us better to acquire an awareness of the societies we all now inhabit, and to act and live within them\u2019. Museums, then, are not just a part of the public sphere, they constitute \u2018a space of participation in public life\u2019 (pp 143, 56, 58\u20139, 15).Thomas\u2019 measured, rather than bombastic, approach to sharing these ideas allows them to land gently. And while he is right to point out that a number of them (if not his specific examples) can be found elsewhere, he is also correct in maintaining that they have to date been widely scattered and have not been collectively formulated in this way. Along the way, Thomas delivers a more than adequate work-out for some of the issues keenly debated in museological circles at the moment: Bourdieux\u2019s analysis of class capital bestowed on gallery visitors; post-colonial qualms about whether and when objects should be repatriated; how identity politics gets played out in exhibitions, and so forth. And doing this for a potentially broader audience is in itself a valuable service. But this is far more than an exercise in synthesis, and his substantial arguments deserve to be discussed widely. The central tenet about the potential for curiosity to lead to healthier civic societies (and the opportunities for museums in particular to achieve this through work with collections) has already become a more urgent topic for us all to consider than when he was writing this book.A number of the examples Thomas chooses, and the details he observes, are telling in themselves. It is good, for example, to be reminded that talk of \u2018audiences\u2019 for museums oddly implies a predominantly oral experience; and to remember too that every museum has a story of origin, which inevitably makes them, no matter what their purported subject matter, history museums of a kind. His point about the ways those of us working in museums \u2013 who were trained to critique the very idea of museums \u2013 now apply self-reflexive practices, is also intriguing to consider. It is gratifying to come across a book about how museums engage with society that does not feel duty bound to start with the assumption that their principle goal is to fix some of society\u2019s ills: a relief not to finish it with a deflated sense that at best they might offer inadequately small solutions to a catalogue of big problems. Thomas starts elsewhere with a refreshing assumption (implied rather than trumpeted) that museums can, and probably already are, doing something quite convincing simply by having the courage and confidence to stand on their own cultural legs and draw on some cherished and extensively-tried-and-tested convictions.Thomas presents a convincing argument adroitly pulled together. But, I confess, I finished it wanting a little more. Anyone who has stayed with me this far can be in no doubt that I am with him in most of what he says; but then I came to this book as an unambiguously pre-converted reader. It\u2019s a subject close to my own interests and sympathies, which may explain why I wanted something a bit fuller and more rounded. But I did sometimes wonder what affect his sermon might have on more sceptical ears. Too often, I had a sense of being on the verge of firmly grasping the topic, only to feel it slip out of my hands.I was eager, for example, to hear more about what curators can and should do to get the most from applying curiosity to collections. Oddly he seems to have more to say about the work of contemporary artists (acting as guest curators), than about those who work in them day-after-day. The idea of curation has recently entered into much wider use, emerging from relative obscurity into popular and cultural ubiquity. In a world of too much, where the problem of selection has become chronic, curation increasingly offers us a way to avoid drowning in stuff, images and information. People of all sorts with all sorts of training are inclined to curate pretty much everything from scientific data to musical playlists to dinner menus. Much has been written about the power of this concept in contemporary culture. So I found it curious that Thomas did not feel the need to say more about how the thoroughly thought-through version of this now-fashionable practice is being experimented with and refined within institutions that have forever been curatorial.I also wanted Thomas to move on from the role of curiosity in grappling with collections to a more in-depth consideration of how museums can foster \u2018public research\u2019. What sorts of enquiries can museums promote that academic departments in universities cannot? I suspect that museum-based investigations can more easily and naturally be cross-disciplinary, with readier access to visual and material culture; ones that are more open to experiential as well as textual evidence, and that draw on opportunities to discover and share almost simultaneously. I also missed Thomas\u2019s thoughts on the effects of museums as spaces \u2013 the cognitive, didactic, emotional and social values inherent in their architecture and design, but also simply their symbolic ethos as places. In this respect, Kali Tzorti\u2019s thorough study Museum Space: Where Architecture Meets Museology would be a very good, though somewhat fatter, volume to read alongside.I worry slightly that Thomas\u2019s important insights could fall into a kind of limbo: those outside the museum world might find this book too narrowly specialised, while those immersed in the issues could mistakenly assume it to be simply a summary of already familiar ideas. In the end, The Return of Curiosity might have been either a more effective shorter essay, or a more convincing (if bulkier) monograph. But these were not the works that Thomas set out to write, and I for one have nevertheless been considerably enlightened by the book that he has written.\n\u00a0\nThe Return of Curiosity: What Museums Are Good For in the 21st Century is published by Reaktion Books Ltd, 2016."},

In the UK the museums of the two royal surgical colleges in London and Edinburgh have placed human anatomical and pathological specimens at the heart of their visitor offer, to public and critical acclaim. In the US the Mutter Museum of the College of Physicians in Philadelphia draws huge crowds, as it has done for decades, while in Europe the Josephinum in Vienna; the Berlin Museum of Medical History at the Charit\u00e9; the Muse\u00e9 Fragonard outside Paris and the Vrolik Museum in Amsterdam are testament both to the long history of anatomical collections as private resource and public spectacle, and to the continuing interest in such collections from non-medical audiences. And while commercial shows such as Gunther von Hagens\u2019 Bodyworlds may have attracted both public and medical criticism when they first appeared over a decade ago, they are now such a common-place visitor attraction that the only risk they carry is of ennui. All of which makes this otherwise excellent set of essays on the fate of anatomical collections feel in some ways oddly pass\u00e9.\nThat said, there is no doubt, as editors Rina Knoeff and Robert Zwijnenberg state in their scene-setting introduction, that a lack of interest in using old specimens and models for their originally intended primary purposes of teaching and research has resulted in ill-judged decisions about disposal or, more often, long periods of neglect that have left them in a perilous state. Their call to arms involves bringing a range of perspectives from the arts and humanities to bear upon objects previously considered medical, and exposes the fluid state of anatomical collections as their uses and users have changed over time. Their cast of collaborators is impressive, and reflects the depth and breadth of scholarship which Knoeff and Zwijnenberg convened during a long-term research project based at the University of Leiden \u2013 at least two of the essays are the products of highly original and much-needed research carried out by PhD students as part of the project.\nThere is much detail for historians of anatomy and its museums to enjoy, making this a handy primer to some well-known collections. The volume is also very deftly stitched together, with common strands woven through and each essay neatly linking to the next, no mean feat across a volume with eighteen contributors (nineteen including artist Lisa Temple-Cox, whose delicate drawings of anatomical specimens from some of the featured museums adorn the dust-jacket).\nThe book itself is structured in five sections. Aside from the editors\u2019 introduction, the scene is set with Ruth Richardson\u2019s \u2018Organ Music\u2019, in which she gives eloquent voice to the inhabitants of the pathology museum, a useful reminder of the ways in which the identities of the \u2018subjects\u2019 of dissection are often the first things to be cut away in their journey from life to chemically preserved afterlife.\nThe importance of identity is picked up in the second section in Andrew Cunningham\u2019s and Cindy Stelmackowich\u2019s essays on the Hunterian Museum in London and the McGill University Collection in Montreal. Quis custodiet ipsos custodies? \u2013 Who curates the curators? \u2013 is the question posed by Cunningham as he unpicks the way in which Richard Owen (1804\u20131892) made his own name by recasting the collection of John Hunter (1728\u20131793) as a Cuvierian museum of comparative anatomy, and in so doing remade Hunter as a \u2018modern\u2019 (by 1830s standards, at least). In fact, Owen\u2019s reinvention of Hunter was only the first of many that ensured that both Hunter\u2019s collection and his reputation remained at the heart of The Royal College of Surgeons of England, a position it continues to occupy today.\nIn contrast, Stelmackowich offers a salutary tale of the converse, linking the declining fortunes of McGill University\u2019s medical museum to the chauvinistic attitudes faced by physician and curator Maude Abbott (1869\u20131940). That the collection \u2013 the remains of which are now (according to Stelmackowich) in a \u2018small locked basement\u2019 at McGill \u2013 survives long enough to become feted as the tangible legacy of a female medical pioneer is something to be wished for.\nTim Huisman then takes us back to the late sixteenth century to explore the evolution of the collection linked to Leiden University\u2019s anatomical theatre, one of the first in Europe. Like the theatre itself the collection was a popular attraction for tourists to Leiden in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and was well-described in a series of catalogues-cum-guidebooks. Huisman argues that despite its fame and its associations with a succession of prestigious anatomical teachers, it was the inability to reconceptualise the collection that led to its demise; by being established in both the medical and the public eye from the start, the ability of the collection to be pulled to suit the changing interests of the former was constrained by the latter. A similar theme emerges from Anita Guerrini\u2019s long-dur\u00e9e survey of the display of human skeletons in early-modern Europe, in which she traces its shifting status from moral to medical object, with some individual skeletons making the transition and others remaining stuck depending, in part, on their visibility to different audiences at different times.\nThe question of audiences, users and their agency is more fully addressed in the third section of the book, with essays by Hieke Huistra on the Leiden anatomical collections, Anna Maerker on the different users and uses of anatomical models in the late nineteenth century, Tatjana Buklijas on the geography of anatomical collections and their users in Vienna, and Alfons Zarzoso and Jos\u00e9 Pardo-Tom\u00e1s on the rise and fall of the Museo Roca in Barcelona. Huistra\u2019s account of the excision of the identities of brother-anatomists Bernard (1697\u20131770) and Frederick Albinus (1715\u20131778) from the anatomical specimens at Leiden University weaves in the role of curators, audiences and of the objects themselves. Unlike models, Huistra argues, the intrinsic nature of specimens as things constituted from the body, and not simply representing the body, enabled them to be \u2018re-made\u2019 in ways which facilitated, if not necessitated, their distancing from their original preparators.\nIn contrast, Maerker cites the physical uniformity and portability and conceptual stability of the papier-mach\u00e9 models marketed by Louis Thomas J\u00e9r\u00f4me Auzoux (1797\u20131880) as key reasons for their popularity. While Huistra looks at how the expert anatomist remade the specimen, Maerker instead looks at how models enabled a range of practitioners outside of the medical academy to present themselves as expert, and in so doing to become \u2018ambassadors\u2019 for the models as quasi-medical objects.\nBuklijas expands upon Huistra\u2019s and Maerker\u2019s focus on the interplay between object, expert and audience by considering the importance of geographical setting, tracing the movement of the collections created by Joseph Hyrtl (1810\u20131894) around different locations in Vienna before and after the revolution of 1848. Buklijas identifies the exhibition of Hyrtl\u2019s specimens on a site previously used for a commercial anatomical museum as particularly problematic, leading to associations with popular entertainment that were detrimental to Hyrtl\u2019s reputation among younger colleagues.\nThe contested nature of \u2018popular\u2019 anatomical museums forms the subject for Zarzoso\u2019s and Pardo-Tom\u00e1s\u2019s essay, which seeks to untangle the history of the anatomical museum created in Barcelona in the 1920s by the showman Francisco Roca (1860\u20131945) and his family. By concentrating on a genre of anatomical exhibition-making in which marketing rhetoric by turns exaggerated and obfuscated the custodial history of the museum they expose the challenges facing historians of similarly liminal anatomical cultures, as well as the ease with which assumptions about audience and use become reified.\nIssues of provenance take centre stage in the penultimate section. First, Marieke Hendriksen looks (at least metaphorically) at the \u2018beaded babies\u2019, a series of preparations of human foetuses mounted in preserving fluid in glass jars in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries by Dutch anatomists, in which the bodies are adorned with strings of coloured beads. Traditionally described (in catalogues) as being of African or Asian origin, Hendriksen deftly exposes the uncertain nature of any claims about their identity or original purpose, and ties this not only to the ways in which these specimens have been treated in the past but to current museological debate about how they should be treated today, including the decision by some museums to withdraw them from public display, creating an irresolvable paradox in which the specimens\u2019 putative problematic history is used to prevent research which might inform a deeper understanding of their origins and thus a more considered ethical approach to their future. Fenneke Sysling\u2019s account of Dutch physical anthropology collections, and particularly the collection of human skulls representing different races, also addresses the importance of provenance, and especially uncertain provenance, in determining the fate of such collections.\nThe last essay in the section, by Tricia Close-Koenig takes a different tack, providing a counterpoint to Cunningham and Huistra by highlighting the accretive nature of paper records describing the Pathological Anatomy Collection of Strasbourg University. While state (as well as individual academic) authority of the collection was asserted through the process of compiling and publishing new catalogues, Close-Koenig asserts that each new presentation of the collection built upon, rather than effaced, what had gone before, so that the collection came to constitute paper as much as tissue.\nThe final section of the book contains three essays on modern museum practice. Sam Alberti begins with a recapitulation of the history of anatomical craft, especially as applied in the museums of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. Bringing the story up to the present by looking at the current work of the College\u2019s Conservation Unit, Alberti argues that the common thread is the amount of skilled work needed to create and preserve anatomical collections, and the ways in which this is privileged such that the work of famous anatomists may be recognised and celebrated, while that of technicians is too frequently forgotten. Flavio H\u00e4ner uses the example of the restoration of a single human skull specimen from the University of Basel\u2019s Anatomy Museum, in which the erasure of inscriptions in order to create a \u2018good, clean anatomical specimen\u2019 removed all trace of the specimen\u2019s provenance (details of which were, thankfully, documented elsewhere, but which fundamentally changes the viewer or user\u2019s relationship with the specimen as historical object).\nKarin Tybjerg closes the section by drawing parallels between the anatomical museum and the biobank as sites of active accumulation of human tissue, rather than simply curation of historical archives. Each can speak to the other, she offers, to suggest the continuing value of human remains and the ways in which these can be reconnected to a human experience of the body.\nAs a form of epilogue, Rina Knoeff reflects on the public audiences for anatomical specimens, and on their affective quality. Exposing and accentuating the personal narratives, identities, and/or humanity of remains is nothing new, but is perhaps more important than ever in an era in which medical authority and to the guardedness which often accompanies medical tissue collections is susceptible to catastrophic failure when public scrutiny is brought suddenly to bear, as in the case of Alder Hey in the UK. Coming full circle, it is perhaps the quality of mortality \u2013 the allusion to fate that underpinned early modern anatomical specimens\u2019 status as mementos mori \u2013 that now provides the best protection against their loss. And so it is slightly disappointing that the collection ends with the well-intentioned if grandiosely titled Leiden Declaration on Human Anatomy/Anatomical Collections, formulated by the participants at the symposium at Leiden University in 2012 from which the book stems. It is unintentionally illuminating, talking as it does of the cultural as well as medical and scientific significance of specimen collections and referring to their relevance to research in a range of scholarly disciplines while studiously avoiding any suggestion that the audience for such collections might extend beyond the academy. If history teaches us anything, it is that the fate of anatomical collections requires not only handing the keys to the museum from one set of custodes to another, but also throwing open the door."},

Ordered by types of anatomy or bodily systems, or by forms of disease or deformity, the strategy created a spectacular visual impact and incorporated vast amounts of material. Such expansive displays impressively conveyed the major enterprise of collecting, dissecting and modelling that began in the seventeenth century and which has shaped the production of knowledge. In the aftermath of scandals about the misuse of human remains, and controversies over the Body Worlds exhibitions, medical museums drew on the tradition of cabinets of curiosities to legitimise their presentation of human specimens and anatomical waxes to a broad audience.[3] The wealth of objects on show in crowded cases vividly illustrated the central role of such collections in research and education, but left little room for interpretive text, or for specific attention to each item included. Such displays often implied medicine\u2019s major role in the categorisation of humans as abnormal or \u2018monstrous\u2019, in legitimising racial hierarchies through scientific \u2018proof\u2019 of white superiority, and in defining women as the weaker sex, although usually without any, or with only very limited, commentary on this history. This also served a very practical problem, given the lack of surviving information about who a specimen came from or how a model was produced.\nIn the context of a wide range of opinions among museum staff and audiences regarding what should be shown, and to whom, cabinets of curiosities set aside the larger questions of why these objects had been saved, or the purpose of re-exhibiting them today, leaving it to visitors to determine their scientific, artistic, historical or educational value. Such silences have become increasingly untenable. In the first place, attendees have often wanted more information about the things they were looking at, even if the limited information available could only explain what pathology or anatomy the object shows, and why it was scientifically valuable. However, these details reinforce the medical gaze already produced by the mode of display, reducing individual people to representative specimens or cases. As a consequence of this, as well as the way much of this material was produced and obtained (well before any standard of informed consent was established and often benefitting from a lack of protections for the poor, enslaved, colonised or condemned), today museum staff and visitors view many of these objects as problematic, putting them at risk of removal or deaccession (Richardson, 2001; Sappol, 2004; Claes and Deblon, 2018). This ignores the role exhibition strategies could play in engaging audiences with these artefacts and the histories they represent. Karin Tybjerg, curator at the Medical Museion in Copenhagen has recently argued that \u2018the discussion of whether human remains should be exhibited has overshadowed the question of how they should\u2019, and as I suggest here, the problem is expanding to encompass a growing list of non-human material that is also considered too risky, or difficult, to display (Tybjerg, 2019). Yet these objects are valuable precisely because they may generate some of the most intense reactions among audiences.As I discuss here, focusing on the representation of disability, race and mental health, some medical museums are beginning to reckon with medicine\u2019s role (and medical museums\u2019 role) in defining \u2018norms\u2019 and declaring some people, characteristics or behaviours as \u2018abnormal\u2019, inferior or deficient. This approach is risky in several senses. By putting scientific authority under critical scrutiny, museums risk antagonising medical organisations and individuals with whom they are affiliated, as well as visitors from the medical profession. By attempting collaboration between different communities of experts who have sometimes been at odds, museums risk clashes between groups and pressure to adopt or suppress conflicting views. Finally, presenting highly contested objects and subjects for public interaction risks alienating audiences and generating controversy and criticism. The third topic I discuss here, reproduction, appears so risky as to be relegated to the sidelines, underscoring the continuing taboos regarding public display and discussion of childbirth, abortion, infertility and miscarriage while simultaneously demonstrating the urgent need to do so. I end by suggesting some strategies that may help to rehabilitate these topics and their material culture in the future medical museum."},

As part of the \u2018One Collection\u2019 programme, some 350,000 objects are undergoing the process of hazard checking, inventory, photography and packing, in order to move from London to a new store at the National Collections Centre in Wiltshire. Along with collections from the museums in Manchester, Bradford and York, the National Collections Centre will house eighty per cent of the Science Museum Group\u2019s vast collections by 2023. This new facility is designed to increase public engagement with, and access to, the stored collections of the Science Museum Group. In so doing, the collection, as well as being physically moved, is also being re-centred as a resource not to be stored, but used, researched, visited, and enjoyed.\nThe current centre of the One Collection programme\u2019s activity is the collection\u2019s point of departure \u2013 Blythe House in West London. This imposing Edwardian Baroque building was designed by noted architect Sir Henry Tanner, and opened as the Post Office Savings Bank in 1903, itself an innovative building and concept at the time.\nAfter banking activities ceased in the mid-twentieth century (and a brief sojourn as a Thames TV film studio \u2013 though it continues to be a mainstay of large-scale film productions today), Blythe House became a museum store for the V&amp;A, the British Museum and the Science Museum. It is currently home to the majority of the Science Museum\u2019s object collections, in over one hundred rooms and scattered across six floors. The collections at Blythe House vary considerably across the topics of science, medicine, technology and art, ranging from ship models to iron lungs, quadrants to drones, anatomical drawings to pocket watches.\nAround 97 per cent of the Science Museum\u2019s collections are in storage at any one time \u2013 a statistic which holds true across much of the heritage sector. Sometimes referred to as the \u2018reserve\u2019 collections, they are available by appointment or request, but receive far fewer visitors than their counterparts on display; while the Science Museum receives over three million visitors a year, Blythe House receives only around a hundred. The thematic massing of objects together in close quarters produces a different kind of curatorial statement. Without explanatory labels, stores offer little interpretive assistance for their objects \u2013 their current life, as part of a working, moving collection in a museum, is often more apparent than their historical significance. The objects are interpreting themselves.\nOne of the lesser known parts of the collection may well be the Art. Although present in the Science Museum since its inception as the South Kensington Museum in 1857, visual collections remained somewhat hidden until the creation of a Pictorial Collection in the 1970s, and its subsequent expansion into the Art collection. Officially named \u2018SCM \u2013 Art\u2019, this now ranges broadly and deeply across art and visual culture, including paintings and drawings, printed bills and trade cards, photography, sculpture, digital art, installations and more. It shows artists and scientists inspiring and critiquing each other, science represented in and to the world, and imagery forming part of scientific work.\nCollections Engagement work forms a core part of the One Collection project exploring ways of opening our collections to new audiences, in new ways, and with new questions. Working experimentally with art, now, offers the opportunity to engage different audiences with the collections and bring in different perspectives. One such perspective has been engaging with staff and students from the BA Fine Art and MA Art and Science courses at Central Saint Martins, through extended collaboration with artist and lecturer Paul O\u2019Kane, and eeodo founder Bada Song. Paul has taught and written before on the concept of \u2018Technologies of Romance\u2019. A first volume publication with eeodo came out of seminars held with students at Central Saint Martins and visits to the Science Museum to look at collections of science, technology and medicine as subjects for an art student's eye.\u00a0 Through discussions, invited speakers and visits to the stores, we developed a project with Paul and Bada for a symposium with a difference."},

As Tito promptly points out, the design of the rocket dates all the way back to the Soviet military\u2019s Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Programme (IBMP) and the historic launch of Sputnik-1 in 1957.[2] However, the particular rocket in his footage was launched on 28 April 2001 with Tito on-board as the world\u2019s first space tourist. Tito had purchased his seat on the Soyuz TM-32 mission at the cost of $20-million dollars, spending 7 days, 22 hours, and 4 minutes vacationing on the ISS.\nSpace travel, Tito explains during his lecture, was a lifelong interest, sparked by the Soviet\u2019s launch of Sputnik-1 and a youthful fascination with the Space Race, setting him on the course to study Aerospace Engineering in college. Subsequently, he worked for five years at Cal Tech\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in the 1960s, calculating the trajectory of the Mariner spacecraft mission to Mars. Dissatisfaction with the salary of a space engineer prompted Tito\u2019s early career change into a \u2018financial engineer\u2019. By the 1980s he had established the Wilshire Associates investment management service, where he made his fortune in pension funds. This was followed by the creation of the Wilshire 5000 Index, a company that monitors macro-level stock activity.\nDespite his early transition into the world of finance, Tito insists that it was a natural evolution from one science to another. In fact, he explains that the computer programming skills that he developed at JPL were the very same ones that he used to make the primary calculations within the stock market. Taking a broad view of market movements and tracing the trajectory of a rocket depended on the same engineering solutions. Now, as the world\u2019s first space tourist, Tito has been able to achieve the ultimate \u2018overview\u2019: a businessman whose company was among the first to visualise and capture macro financial movements in the stock market, has also looked down upon the world from afar.\nWhile Tito\u2019s first-hand account of what some might call the first holiday in space has thus far been overlooked as a footnote in the broader history of space travel, I would like to suggest that it signals a definitive transition in the orientation of the US and Russian space programmes. More than a novelty, Tito\u2019s journey represents the beginning of a new worldview \u2013 a dramatic shift from the Cold War perspective that looked back on the Earth as a battlefield, or even an ecological gaze on the Earth as a fragile and finite organism, to one that looks back on Earth as a luxury attraction. It is no surprise that Tito\u2019s lecture took place as part of The Dean\u2019s Executive Leadership Series, which invites speakers to \u2018share their view on the real world of business\u2019.[3] Indeed, his slideshow responds to the premise by presenting the view of the world from a perspective of privilege and business achievement. \u00a0During his teenage years Tito anticipated his own space voyage in the context of the popular science fiction of the time \u2013 a vision that prevailed alongside the governmental and military space programmes. The image of the space-age interstellar traveller was already drawing on a long lineage of civilian explorers in speculative science fiction literature and film at the turn of the twentieth century. The pioneering trip to the Moon in Jules Verne's novel, De la Terre \u00e0 la Lune (1865; From the Earth to the Moon), Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s film, Le Voyage Dans la Lune (1902; A Trip to the Moon), and the Soviet Union\u2019s feature film Cosmic Voyage (1933), portray adventurers and enthusiasts embarking on journeys inside of spacecraft. Elements of the space tourism industry also first appeared in the space age fictions of Arthur C Clarke's, A Fall of Moondust (1961) and Joanna Russ' Picnic on Paradise (1968), which feature wealthy Earthlings and their misadventures in space travel.\nAs new technologies have continued to revolutionise everyday life, visions of space exploration have also proliferated, constantly speculating on the physical and territorial limits of human experience. In Space and the American Imagination, historian Howard McCurdy (2011, p 5) writes that, \u2018The grand vision of space exploration drew considerable strength from its capacity to excite and entertain\u2019. Suggesting that the very scale and ambition of these visions were \u2018crucial to their survival in the marketplace of imagination\u2019 (McCurdy, 2011, p 6). Tito himself specifically points to the classic novel 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) written by Arthur C Clarke and its film adaptation by Stanley Kubrick as the seed for his own early space travel fantasy. In keeping with 1960s popular culture, the space faring passengers in the film travel in comfortable and luxurious Pan American Airways spaceships and stay in space hotels run by the Hilton Corporation (2001: A Space Odyssey, 1968).[4] But in the actual year 2001, at the age of 61, Tito\u2019s prospects of accomplishing his lifelong dream of orbiting the Earth came together very differently from his fantasy. Instead of comfortable shuttle planes, it was the appropriated infrastructure of the newly commercialised space industry of the collapsed Soviet Union and a $20-million-dollar contract that created the necessary conditions for his flight."},

Among these editions, very important work was done by Giovanni Piumati, curating the transcription and critical edition of the Codex Atlanticus in the Biblioteca Ambrosiana between 1894 and 1904 in a sumptuous version from the presses of Ulrico Hoepli. During those same years, studies of Leonardo\u2019s scientific works proliferated: fundamental was the work of Theodor Beck, who was one of the first engineers to attempt a philological reading of the drawings and provide an interpretation of them using modern diagrams. In 1906, on the occasion of the international exhibition for the opening of the Simplon Tunnel, Luca Beltrami hypothesised constructing a model of a flying machine based on Leonardo\u2019s manuscripts, but the idea remained on paper.It was only in 1929, for the First National Exhibition of the History of Science in Florence, that scholars Raffaele Giacomelli and Giuseppe Schneider produced the first eight models, all in the field of aeronautics: already from these precocious examples questions began arising on problems of interpreting Leonardo\u2019s drawings and about how to counterbalance the scruples dictated by philology against the obvious need to make integrations to the drawings that, not being actual plans or projects, were often incomplete or lacking in details relating to mechanical or structural parts.In 1933 the Italian Government decided to participate in the Century of Progress World\u2019s Fair in Chicago with an exhibition displaying the supremacy of Italy in Science and Technics, from the Ancient Civilisation to the present time. The exhibition was organised by the CNR (National Council of Research), which had been founded ten years earlier and was directed by Guglielmo Marconi. More than three hundred objects were displayed in the Hall of Science: among them we can find one of the earliest models designed thanks to the interpretation of a Leonardo da Vinci drawing: a spinning wheel with mobile wings by Giovanni Strobino, a scholar who was expert in the history of weaving. (Strobino is one of the few scholars who also contributed to the two following exhibitions, in 1939 and 1952.)\nThe success of the Leonardo models was consecrated ten years later, however, in 1939, by the Mostra di Leonardo e delle invenzioni italiane (Exhibition on Leonardo and Italian Inventions), which the press later rechristened La Leonardesca, organised in Milan at the Palazzo dell\u2019Arte (today the Triennale).\nThe nationalistic key and the political encouragement with which the event was organised were decisive: with the Fascist era in full swing and just before the war, Leonardo became the symbol for celebrating autarchy and the supremacy of Italian genius, to exhibit with pride the successes of an Italy that had no need of technological contributions from foreign powers. This was the reason for displaying alongside the chief exhibition of Leonardo the principal novelties of Italian technology, among which were the first experimental television programmes in Italy, again in 1939, by the Italian public broadcasting monopoly EIAR (Ente Italiano per la Audizioni Radifoniche)[2].\u00a0\nThe purpose of the exhibition is to celebrate the universal and unequalled genius of Leonardo da Vinci, assumed as practically the symbol of all Latin and Christian, and therefore Roman, civilization, and to highlight the spiritual connections uniting this great man of accomplishments and creator with the realizations of Mussolinian and Imperial Italy. The combining of the Vincian celebrations with the exhibition of Italian inventions tends to demonstrate the continuity of the creative genius of the race and the great possibilities opening up to those within the climate of Fascist will [from the Exhibition programme, Mostra di Leonardo da Vinci e delle Invenzioni italiane, Milan, 1939][3].The art section of the exhibition presented many masterworks by Leonardo and his school from all over the world. (Just a few months before the beginning of the Second World War, a very clever piece of diplomatic work succeeded in bringing paintings and drawings from both Germany and Great Britain to Milan.) Among the Leonardo drawings, a large selection of Windsor folios were present, together with drawings from the Duke of Devonshire Collection and the manuscripts preserved by the Institut de France in Paris[4]. Additionally, the originals of a large part of the archival documents collected to date relating to Leonardo\u2019s life were exhibited.This section was largely criticised by a part of the academic world, which considered the selection of artworks superficial and the supervision of Giorgio Nicodemi, Director of the Museums of the Castello Sforzesco, too compromised with the Fascist government; a fake painting by a private collector, called Madonna Noya, was also displayed. A very smart review of the exhibition, which was largely documented in the Italian and foreign press, was written and published by the novelist Carlo Emilio Gadda[5]. In spite of this climate, the exhibition marked a decisive phase in the study and, above all, the divulgation of Leonardo\u2019s thoughts and works. The staging and setup of the exhibition was curated by architect Giuseppe Pagano, who was involved in the final months to coordinate a chaotic organization[6]. The exhibition was conceived with significant rhetorical excesses and emphatic tones characteristic of other exhibitions from the Fascist period. Great attention, however, was given to the reconstruction of historical context, along with an expert, scenographic use of photography.The Executive Committee, coordinated by Giorgio Nicodemi for the scientific content and by Giuseppe Pagano for the scenography, was drawn from a rich constellation of scholars and architects, each of whom was entrusted with the organisation of one or more exhibition rooms.By way of example, the monumental Atrium, with its highly evocative character and where the \u2018column-raising\u2019 machine which had been reconstructed on a colossal scale was exhibited, was curated by Giovanni Muzio; the Verrocchio Room, by Pietro Toesca; and the Leonardeschi Room, by Studio BBPR[7]. The scenography was largely influenced by the new rationalistic style, even if many period reconstructions were added, sometimes in a confused way.Among the different sections of the exhibition, a prominent part was given to the display of the works of Leonardo as engineer. Around two hundred models were designed and built starting from the interpretation of Leonardo\u2019s drawings. Engineer Arturo Uccelli was entrusted as head of the Models Office, where scholars including Giorgio Canestrini, Carlo Zammattio, Giovanni Strobino, Domenico Argentieri, and Luigi Tursini dedicated themselves to the study and interpretation of Leonardo\u2019s manuscripts, to the execution of technical drawings for the cited inventions, and to the construction of related models[8].\nBetween 1938 and 1939, these experts also published many works dedicated to various aspects of Leonardo\u2019s scientific activity, from Canestrini\u2019s studies on motion to Strobino\u2019s on textiles, from Argentieri\u2019s researches on optics to Tursini\u2019s naval weapons. The exhibition thus presented the results of these researches that even today, in spite of their being surpassed by newer, more up-to-date approaches, constitute important episodes in the divulgation of Leonardo\u2019s technical thought. In this perspective, special rooms were prepared dedicated to Astronomy, Mathematics, Cartography, Hydraulics, Shipbuilding, Anatomy, Botany, Optics, Mechanics, and Flight. The latter room was curated by Raffaele Giacomelli himself, who ten years earlier had presented his first interpretations at Florence and London[9]. Even though attention was given most particularly to those machines that were considered \u2018anticipatory\u2019 of modern inventions, the process of the study and interpretation overall was serious and rigorous, and constituted a fundamental step for the history of Leonardo modelling. Many of the models were realised on a large scale, often finished with brilliant colours and many of them could be put in motion manually or by means of electric motors. Of course, there was some forcing on the interpretative level to allow for the contexts of theatrical staging, visitor involvement, and interactivity, heralding the times. Associated with the models were photographic enlargements from the Leonardo manuscripts to show the original drawings, and this pairing of drawing and model was to be maintained in the future museum gallery.In an article published that same year in Casabella, Giuseppe Pagano described his interpretation of the exhibition and the reconstruction of Leonardo\u2019s machines:Remote from any idea of immediate utilization, from any background of false construction site, or false weaving mill, or false typography, the looms, the presses, the drainage machines, each exceptional or beyond-normal construction followed the same reasoning that first awakened Leonardo\u2019s interest: the same disinterested reasoning. Rather than machines to be patented, these became rational devices, mechanical experiments of sublime value. It pleased us, then, to give to more than one of these machines an unexpected color, blood red, pastel pink, deep black, so as to animate also their merit in terms of line and mass, against the white walls. To some this seemed to be a sacrilege against science, but many understood that the colorings gave an illuminating accent to the mechanical groups, by subdividing them into logical groupings suggested by color alone and leading them to live a bit beyond their already deluded high-handedness.And then he continued: Nor, conversely, even if one had wanted simply to pursue further elaboration of these particular researches, in the most abstract scientific sense, would it have been possible here. Too many of the machines Leonardo designed had to be realized smaller than life-size, more as explicatory models or personal interpretations than as machines effectively conceived by Leonardo; too many others had to be presented more as expository objects than as functional machines. On the other hand, this could not be an industrial laboratory, but only an exhibition, and as such it had to submit to the same ordering criteria, and live in the same art atmosphere as all the rest of the Leonardesca exhibition (Pagano, 1939, pp 6\u201319).The exhibition of the machine models was so successful that it was repeated in New York during the 1940 Universal Exposition[10], at the New York Museum of Science and Industry in the Rockefeller Center, which today no longer exists. This event, supported by the Italian Ministry of Popular Culture (Ministero della Cultura Popolare), was also a sign of gratitude to the United States for the generous loans of works of art to the 1939 Milan exhibition. In 1942 the models were once again displayed in Tokyo, but during their journey back to Italy they were destroyed when the ship transporting them was bombed[11].Fortunately, a large number of the technical drawings realised for construction of the models based on interpretation of Leonardo\u2019s studies survived destruction or dispersion. In the following years these would constitute precious documents toward being able to materialise the dream, merely outlined in 1939, of developing a permanent museum dedicated to Leonardo da Vinci and his technical works. A portion of the drawings are currently preserved in the Museum\u2019s historical archives while the rest are preserved in the Ente Raccolta Vinciana in the Castello Sforzesco, Milan."},

The term co-production was used by Elinor Ostrom, and her colleagues Roger B Parks, Gordon P Whitaker and Stephen L Percy, in exploring law enforcement. They found that law enforcement was not just a case of what the police themselves did; rather citizens constantly played a role through a variety of actions such as locking their door, reporting crimes (or not) or by subverting police efforts (1978, p 383). Co-production was then picked up in the 1990s, again in the US, with a focus on co-production between a core economy of family, friends and community and private sector and government agencies (Cahn, 2004) and then again late in the first decade of this century in the context of UK reform of public service and the welfare state (Goss, 2007; Gammon and Lawson, 2008; Stephens, Collins and Boyle, 2008) and in terms of local democracy, the third sector and participatory models of policy produce and governance (e.g. Verschuere, Brandsen and Pestoff, 2012; Durose and Richardson, 2016).Reading across these different iterations of public policy approaches to co-production, it is possible to identify two key moves. The first is to pluralise the variety and variability of factors that lead to good public policy outcomes. For example, in developing understandings of what they termed \u2018the public policy production process\u2019, Ostrom et al enrich and complicate the picture beyond any idea of a generic causality between the \u2018input\u2019 of police and the outcomes of law enforcement. Instead they draw a more complex picture of interacting elements, including the organisational arrangements within the particular police departments, such as access to resources, for example cars and radios, but also the individual characteristics both of police (do they sit in their car or walk around?) and citizens (do they lock the door or report crime?) (Ostrom et al, 1978, pp 387\u201388). In one of their 1978 diagrams they indicate a web, a nonlinear network of variable inputs, which interact in various ways depending on the people involved and local circumstances and leading to a variety of outputs and outcomes (1978, p 386). This first move to pluralise and show a greater complexity of cause and effect tends also to be accompanied by a second move.[2] This second move, present both in Ostrom et al\u2019s work and the UK 2000s debate, is focussed on reinventing the relevance and responsiveness of state provision of welfare and health care and, in doing this, on making the case for the distinctive and necessary contribution of the state or public institutions:\nCrucially, co-production will help us manage the central paradox of public service reform, namely our competing desires for equality, or universalism, and the need for innovation through diversity. It can achieve this by creating spaces where tensions can be understood, shared and managed.[\u2026]The benefits of co-production are both instrumental \u2013 more responsive and better services produced more efficiently \u2013 and intrinsic \u2013 ensuring services are valued because they are social, collective and participatory. Co-production adds to our sense of community and feeling of well-being. It provides a moral underpinning for public services (Gammon and Lawson, 2008, p 5).\nAs such, co-production offers a particular kind of political bargain. In its public policy iteration, co-production involves an opening up, offering a way of recognising that more people \u2013 variety and variable constituencies of \u2018co\u2019 \u2013 can helpfully produce public goods. Yet, at the same time, co-production implies a demarcation and stabilisation between different types of agencies, between state/government and public/communities/users. \u00a0This double move of expansion (to include more people) and stabilisation of difference (between public agency and the public) resonates both with the development of displays and their glass cases and also with newer practices of community participation in museums. As my argument unfolds, I will suggest that the increasingly well-documented tensions in museum community projects \u2013 the difficulties of \u2018sharing authority\u2019 (Lynch and Alberti, 2010; Waterton and Smith, 2010) \u2013 relate to the desire to expand the number of people involved, while seeking to retain, and even stabilise, museums\u2019 political assumptions. A key contribution the STS genealogy of co-production brings when fused with museum community co-production is that increasing the variety of people tends also to open up more fundamental questions, not least what the \u2018it\u2019 is that co-production creates."},

The USSR Industrial Exhibition was a masterpiece of the Soviet propaganda machine, offering a glimpse into its lifestyle while promoting the communist way of life. The 87-metre span of the exhibition hall\u2019s steel truss roof provided an impressive framework for the displays of the latest trends in science, culture and education (Cross, 2012, p 292). The \u2018Hall of the Cosmos\u2019, a darkened tall cylindrical display space in the very centre of the exhibition contained engineering models of Sputniks and planetary probes, a revolving globe and state-of-the-art audio-visual content (Clarkson, 2012, p 293). Outer space was at the heart of the 1961 exhibition and, coinciding with the triumphant visit of Yuri Gagarin, made a long-lasting impression on the British public (The Times, 1961).Fifty years later the curators at the Science Museum sought to bring to London the iconic objects that had made this golden age of space exploration. The Cosmonauts exhibition endeavours to present the most significant collection of space artefacts ever to leave Russia: real, cosmonaut-flown spacecraft, pioneering rocket engines, spacesuits and life support systems. But as crucial as the obvious \u2018star\u2019 objects are, the exhibition also reflects on how Russia made science fiction into science fact and confounds expectations by starting with the creative and philosophical concepts of late nineteenth century Russia. Clearly, it tells the story of the Soviet heroes Sergei Korolev, Yuri Gagarin, Valentina Tereshkova and Alexei Leonov, but they all stand on the shoulders of early innovators such as Konstantin Tsiolkovsky (Millard, 2014, p 22\u201323). Not that the exhibition lacks for astonishing loans too, such as the engineering model of the first satellite Sputnik 1 and the Vostok 6 descent module of Valentina Tereshkova, the first woman in space. Indeed, this article also outlines some of the epic negotiations undertaken to secure a range of iconic loans.One should also note that an exhibition covering such a wide time range must raise fascinating issues about Russian identity too. Even those of us involved in the project have often fallen into the lazy shorthand of referring to the \u2018Soviet\u2019 story. This is wrong. The space story really starts in the final years of Imperial Russia, flourishes in an era of revolution and the Bolshevik state, enjoys a \u2018golden\u2019 age in the Soviet period of Nikita Khrushchev and sustains excellence in the post-Communist era of Boris Yeltsin and Vladimir Putin. For many years the public perception of space science has been known only through the considerable achievements of America\u2019s NASA and the defining moment of the Apollo 11 Moon mission of 1969. And yet Soviet Russia (however defined) was the first space-faring nation. It launched the world\u2019s first satellite (Sputnik) and four years later the first human into orbit (Yuri Gagarin). But when NASA\u2019s Neil Armstrong took his first steps on the Moon the earlier Soviet feats were all but forgotten. The secrecy under which Russia carried out its space programme \u2013 all part of its military-industrial complex \u2013 no doubt lies at the root of this, and it has been the Science Museum\u2019s mission to bring this untold story to light, through an exhibition of unprecedented ambition. The Museum\u2019s desire to tell the unknown story through an unprecedented showcase of real historical technology, equipment and memorabilia proved to be one of the most complex and challenging projects within the museum sector. It involved negotiations with the military sector, the declassification of certain exhibits, the engagement of state authorities in both countries, and all at a time when the political and economic weather threatened to undermine the project on both ends in a country shaken by economic crisis, territorial disputes and under EU sanctions."},

Working primarily in film, she brings a particular concern with the process and practice of photochemical film to a timeless yet contemporary eye on the world. Her art is as much about the meaning of film as a material, as it is about the subjects she explores through the medium of film.\nEarlier this year, Dean created a series of exhibitions running concurrently at three major London art galleries: the Royal Academy of Arts, the National Portrait Gallery, and the National Gallery. In the first ever collaboration between these institutions, each exhibition focused on a different genre traditionally associated with painting: landscape, portrait, and still life (respectively). In each, Dean mixed new and existing works with pieces from the collection or other artists. Her art works and curatorial choices opened the definition of each genre, making one think about the cultural, social, and even scientific, construction of what we consider identity, objects and \u2018scapes\u2019.At the National Portrait Gallery, Dean had the honour of creating their first exhibition devoted to film, with the majority of pieces in 16mm. Each took an expansive approach to portraiture, focusing on a slow conversation with the artist Mario Merz, the writer Michael Hamburger handling the apples from his garden (see Figure 2), or the dancer Merce Cunningham performing \u2018Stillness\u2019 to John Cage\u2019s famous 4 minutes 33 seconds of silence (see Figure 3).\nAlong the central corridor of the exhibition stretched a photographic series portraying (the studio of) the artist Cy Twombly, lingering on the technologies of his practice \u2013 the tools, chemicals, texts and objects \u2013 creating a balance with the material technology of Dean\u2019s own works. Her films are more installations than images. The whirr of the projector, the thin slivers of light, mirrors and flickers are fundamentally part of the experience. The film is as much the subject as the medium of her art.At the National Gallery, Dean selected works from the permanent collection to hang alongside her own new and existing pieces. These works were subtle, the busy visitor had to slow down and let themselves be drawn in. As the exhibition opening text advised, \u2018still life asks us to look long and look slowly, without the intrusion of words\u2019. Wolfgang Tillmans\u2019 Beerenstilleben (2007), a photograph of plastic fruit punnets on a windowsill, sat next to Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n\u2019s painting A Cup of Water and a Rose (c.1630), opening our eyes to which objects and spaces are worthy of record and attention. Dean\u2019s film of the slowly decaying bottled pears in Prisoner Pair (2008) (see Figure 4) projected life (and death) into William Henry Hunt\u2019s neighbouring watercolour of Apples (nineteenth century) (see Figure 5). Dean\u2019s works were back-projected onto the walls so that they seemed to be paintings come alive, or sudden windows to another world. Dean\u2019s material becomes light itself with the life and glow of these films.\nAt the Royal Academy, Dean filled the newly-refurbished spaces of the Burlington Gardens extension with a range of material responses to the idea of landscape, drawing in botany, cosmography, geology, travel and natural phenomena. Closely-studied clouds scudded across one wall, captured using Dean\u2019s other characteristic material: chalk on a series of blackboards. Cases contained her ongoing collections of Round Stones and Four, Five, Six, Seven and Nine Leaf Clovers (Figure 6). Antigone, a new diptych film created for the exhibition, made the physical practices of photomechanical film particularly visible. Much of the film strip is shown with the sprocket holes visible at each side, while sections are also masked and combined to allow Dean to show multiple views within a single frame (Figure 7). The epic tale of Antigone, sister and guide to the blinded Oedipus, takes place across the very different landscapes of Bodmin Moor, the geysers of Yellowstone National Park, and post-industrial Illinois. All of these environments give shape to the epic narrative, shot miles and hours apart, but combined by Dean\u2019s masking, cutting, splicing: the physical process of editing film.\nDean consciously emphasises the use of these film technologies in her work: the physical practices that many today barely understand, and increasingly consider obsolete. She has returned consciously to the word \u2018analogue\u2019, seeking not only to separate her work from \u2018digital\u2019 but seeing this as a statement of \u2018proportion and likeness\u2019. Dean\u2019s \u2018analogue\u2019 means \u2018a representation of an object that resembles the original; not a transcription or a translation but an equivalent in a parallel form\u2019.[1] She reminds us of the attempts to create \u2018objectivity\u2019 in scientific imagery, which have been traced by Lorraine Daston and Peter Galison[2], with her added attention to the particular materials of representation.These three exhibitions were a bold collaboration that brought a new eye to three institutions and their artworks. While the later dates of the Royal Academy show meant that the three displays were only open simultaneously for ten days, a rich catalogue allows the dialogue between the three to live on and develop. With a range of essays, Dean\u2019s own texts on her new pieces, and images of all works in the exhibitions (including multiple stills from each film), this publication captures the rich possibilities of Dean\u2019s work. For all museums, Tacita Dean: LANDSCAPE, PORTRAIT, STILL LIFE, encourages ambitious thinking in staging collaborative projects. For science museums, Dean\u2019s art demonstrates the technological riches that are to be found in visual and material attention to images.Tacita Dean: PORTRAIT was at the National Portrait Gallery from 15 March to 28 May 2018Tacita Dean: STILL LIFE was at the National Gallery from 15 March to 28 May 2018Tacita Dean: LANDSCAPE was at the Royal Academy of Arts from 19 May to 12 August 2018The exhibitions were curated by Sarah Lea and Desiree De Chair at the Royal Academy of Arts; Sarah Howgate, Senior Curator, Contemporary Collections at the National Portrait Gallery, and Bart Cornelis, Curator of Dutch and Flemish Paintings at the National Gallery."},

Academia\u2019s previously dominant role has gradually had to be shared with areas of business, government, broadcast, entertainment and, increasingly, across the tidal wave of \u2018citizens-band\u2019 on-line initiatives. There are, of course, economic repercussions that follow from the globalisation and general diffusion of research agendas, especially when questions of \u2018translation\u2019 and \u2018impact\u2019 threaten to further complicate a simple ideal of the detached and disinterested pursuit of knowledge (Munck, 2010). The consequent intellectual recalibrations are generally shaking up campuses, with innovations being trialled in examinations, course structures, study methods and funding strategies. And away from formal education, various quasi-academic enterprises have popped up, signalling their learning-with-a-difference approaches through evocative titles like School of Life, Institute of Ideas and Makerversity. Even thoroughly commercialised summer music festivals have toyed with brainier sideshows based on comedy, mindfulness, poetry, drama and even science.What, one wonders, could museums contribute (collaboratively maybe) by way of their own unique new courses, trialled as \u2018summer schools\u2019? Might they offer students seeking a less orthodox curriculum access to an open public platform that hosted widely sourced guest experts; studio or laboratory-based workshops actively focused on material- and visual-culture; and learning environments that made the most of the far-from-ivory-towers public soil in which museums are so firmly planted; all of which channelled by a thematic enquiry aimed at some productive (if not examined) outcomes? We should be wary of the over-orchestrated meddling that such speculations potentially posit. Museums have too often been dragged, albeit sometimes with good intentions, far from what Hilde Hein has playfully, but also wisely, reminded us are their \u2018idle roots\u2019; having to work around heavy-handed instrumentalist goals foisted onto institutions that should essentially be \u2018gratuitous and wondrously unencumber[ed]\u2019 (Hein, 2006, pp 1\u20132). It is all too easy to over-promise what they are capable of while simultaneously ignoring what in essence they are good at. But a general point about the relatively untapped research potential of museums nonetheless still stands: they are ideally placed to exploit distinctive new roles in a shifting epistemological landscape, providing places for alternative models of partaking in more accessible research.Since its launch in 2007, Wellcome Collection has sought to make a contribution to the idea of popular, investigation-led programming. Starting with the levelling assumption of a shared \u2018incurable curiosity\u2019, its experimental exhibitions, events and other initiatives have attempted to grapple with interstitial topics \u2013 ones that aren\u2019t entirely owned by a single discipline, and that provide intriguing, low-threshold entry points for inquisitive lay-people. Sometimes these projects have tackled subjects as broad as sleep, war, death or dirt (ones in which insights and examples from science and medicine sit comfortably alongside others from art, architecture and anthropology). At other times the curatorial approach has instead begun in such seemingly narrow domains as Japanese outsider art or Mexican votive pictures and from there draw out telling, specific inflections of such universal ideas as creativity, hope and gratitude. Woven throughout all these projects has been a collaborative enthusiasm for finding things out across expert viewpoints and practices, but also, crucially, with the involvement of an active visiting public.\nWhat general characteristics might such museum-based investigations share? To start with, Stefan Collini has helpfully contrasted two epistemological formulae. In one equation \u2018skills + information = knowledge\u2019; in the other, \u2018experience + reflection = understanding\u2019 (Collini, 2012, pp 77\u201378). The former has worked exceedingly well in the sciences; but the latter, he suggests, is more illuminating for the humanities, where understanding is recognised as \u2018a human activity that depends in part upon the qualities of the understander\u2019, and where the \u2018kinds of understanding and judgement exercised\u2026are of a piece with [those]\u2026involved in living a life\u2019. With very few exceptions (scientists working with natural history collections probably being the most obvious), the fresh ideas and thinking that museums create has, in Collini\u2019s terms, more to do with \u2018understanding\u2019 than scientific knowledge. No matter what their subject, museum programming is, I believe, properly and primarily concerned with generating the more local, subjective and shorter-lived insights of the humanities. Embracing the fact that those who engage with museums (from curators and researchers through to audiences) are more concerned to think things through than find things out, they should aim to manufacture a type of understanding that is decidedly livelier and more relevant rather than the alternative, drier, but frankly unrealistic promise of enduring objective knowledge.Museums seem predisposed to guide inquisitive minds toward topics that sit comfortably between established academic traditions, in part no doubt because their collections are so frequently disparate in nature, and so open to potential re-examination from fresh perspectives. Participants who engage with this type of innovative enquiry are also prone to exploit more than one type of experience. To borrow the sentiments expressed in John Dewey\u2019s approach to aesthetics, in welcoming the poetic as well as prosaic, the aesthetic as well as scientific, and expressions as well as statements, museums don\u2019t just lead their guests towards experiences: they genuinely constitute them (Dewey, 1980, p 85). Visitors go to museums in search of enriching experiences and seem to find surprisingly little difficulty in turning from looking at things, to reading a little, to (sometimes) talking, or at least listening, to others, to (almost invariably) watching a film, or playing a game, for example. They also increasingly expect actively to do a thing or two: to make something tangible, or at least a mark or verbal contribution. This experientially varied version of museum thinking will for many recall Howard Gardner\u2019s breakthrough insights into our \u2018multiple intelligences\u2019, which added synthetic, creative, empathetic, kinetic and other types of acumen to more traditional forms of logical, factual and linguistic understanding (Gardner, 2011).\nThere is also something profoundly aesthetic about the self-motivated research that I am advocating. For no matter what their ostensible subject matter or content, or indeed style of presentation, museums are, I believe, always in part about art. Svetlana Alpers identified this as \u2018the museum effect\u2019, which is maybe just one specific instance of the distinction John Dewey made between recognition and perception (Alpers, 1991, pp 25\u20137). The former \u2018involves no stir of the organism, no inner commotion. But an act of perception proceeds by waves that extend serially throughout the entire organism\u2019. In an era of ever-shortening attention spans, this entreaty to examine things in museums \u2018as if art\u2019 can lead us back to the value of really delving into something, rather than just briefly noticing it. The limiting \u2018conception that objects have fixed and unalterable values is precisely the prejudice from which art emancipates us\u2019. And it is the \u2018museum effect\u2019 that helps us sidestep the trap of adhering to \u2018conventional associations\u2019. Sticking with Dewey just a little longer, his subtly persuasive view of art also encourages us to recognise how thoroughly it is connected with, and yet an illuminating extension of, everyday life. It throws \u2018off the covers that hide the expressiveness of experienced things; \u2026 [enabling] us to forget ourselves by finding ourselves in the delight of experiencing the world about us\u2019. Applied to museums, these sentiments are a reminder that their aesthetic significance lies not simply in setting off precious things in attractive surroundings, but also rather more fundamentally, in their encouragement to visitors to grasp life-enhancing insights (Dewey, 1980, pp 53, 95, 104).\nIf museums encourage an active concern with an experience-based aesthetic, they fundamentally do so by directing attention towards special tangible instances (things), rather than abstract propositions. Exhibits have forever been the stuff of museums, and as anthropologist Daniel Miller insists: \u2018the best way to understand, convey and appreciate our humanity is through attention to our fundamental materiality\u2019, because this is where we derive \u2018the landscapes of our imagination, as well as the cultural environment to which we adapt\u2019 (Miller, 2011, pp 4, 51). The complicated and shifting significance of objects will, of course, be endlessly asserted and reconsidered; but it has been interesting to see recent challenges to the dominant semiotic emphasis on meaning \u2013 the idea that museums should principally aim to articulate hidden symbolic significances. Miller asks us instead to linger with the superficial aspects of things, and is joined by literary theorist Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht in reasserting the value of \u2018the thingness of the world\u2019: its presence (Gumbrecht, 2004, p 92). With these immediate qualities of things in mind, two other concepts illuminate the power museums can derive from their objects: namely, position and juxtaposition. The art of curating in many ways emerges from a disciplined extension of the very ordinary act of placing something so that it is noticed: a theatrically suspended means of pointing at something. Added to this initial material gesture is the second one of placing other things in proximity to complement, contrast or somehow relate to the first. And as anthropologist Gregory Bateson rather grandly asserts, the \u2018word idea, in its most elementary sense, is synonymous with difference\u2019. Museums allow differences to teach."},

It didn\u2019t last long, though; within four months Sputnik 1 was circling the Earth every 90 minutes (see Figure 1). To some, the launch heralded a new era \u2013 of space travel and unlimited energy; to others it was threatening \u2013 politically, economically or militarily. It was clear, though, that the world would never be the same again.\nAlmost exactly six years to the day after the launch, the newly-elected leader of the Labour Party, Harold Wilson, set out a radical agenda for change at the party\u2019s annual conference:\n'\u2026in all our plans for the future, we are re-defining and re-stating our Socialism in terms of the scientific revolution. But that revolution cannot become a reality unless we are prepared to make far-reaching changes in economic and social attitudes which permeate our whole system of society' (Labour Party, 1963, p 7).\nWilson\u2019s point was that without a more equitable society, the advances in science and technology that seemed to be on the horizon would never be achieved. No doubt at the back of Wilson\u2019s mind was C P Snow\u2019s Rede lecture (1959), later published as 'The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution', which \u2018diagnosed the loss of a common culture and [identified] the emergence of two distinct cultures: those represented by scientists on the one hand and those Snow termed \u201cliterary intellectuals\u201d on the other' (Critchley, 2001, p 49).\n'If the former are in favour of social reform and progress through science, technology and industry, then intellectuals are what Snow terms \u201cnatural Luddites\u201d in their understanding of and sympathy for advanced industrial society' (ibid.).\nThe point I wish to make here is that we sometimes forget that there is far more to science communication and engagement than enthusing people about the wonders of nature/the universe/the human body and so on. In my view,[1]\u00a0 science engagement that does not promote, in Wilson\u2019s words, \u2018far-reaching changes in economic and social attitudes\u2019 is a hollow enterprise.\nWilson realised that the major changes in society that he wanted to see would require a greater role for science in all walks of life: \u2018\u2026in the Cabinet room and the board room alike those charged with the control of our affairs must be ready to think and to speak in the language of our scientific age\u2019 (ibid., p 7). On another occasion, Wilson said that he wanted to \u2018replace the cloth cap [with] the white laboratory coat as the symbol of British labour\u2019 (Guardian, 2013).\nWilson could refer to \u2018the white laboratory coat\u2019 knowing that everyone would understand what he meant. Even though the majority of the public would never see inside a real laboratory in their lives, they had seen many on cinema screens, invariably populated by male scientists often working for or with the military. Wilson knew that the British public would not only identify \u2018boffins\u2019 as having contributed to winning the war but would also see them as an increasingly important group of people in winning the peace. In his mind, the workers in the white coats would be ones who would help to forge the new Britain in the \u2018white heat\u2019 of the revolution that was his vision \u2013 Wilson\u2019s father had been an industrial chemist and so he was probably more familiar than most with lab coats.\nThe idea, though, that the public might actually influence science policy would barely have appeared on Wilson\u2019s radar. In the \u2018swinging sixties\u2019 science was still seen as accessible to a small number of remote individuals rather than as something for everyone to engage in. The public certainly paid for science and scientific research and much of that funding went into military applications. In order to continue its research, science needed public support and it needed a continuous stream of bright new recruits. A pro-active science lobby began to establish itself, keen to promote science-friendly policies and to promote its work to the public.\nChanges in UK society in the 1960s and 1970s created a public more likely to challenge authority. Their attitudes were fuelled by frustration with the continued inequity in UK society and unease about the state of the environment. Science and scientists were beginning to be seen as part of the problem as well as part of the solution. Growing concern about the potential damage that could be done to science if it lost public trust led to the emergence of a public understanding of science movement.\nThis was a time when the public\u2019s engagement with science and technology tended to be driven by invention, innovation and events. The successful Moon landing in 1969 was seen as the epitome of human ingenuity but many recognised that rather than being a \u2018giant leap for mankind\u2019 it was, in reality, an example of US political will asserting itself over its Cold War enemy, the USSR. Public interest in Moon landings began to tail-off remarkably during the 1970s despite the intense drama of Apollo 13.\nIncreasing unease among the science lobby about the level of public support during the 1970s and 1980s led to calls for a rethink of the relationship between science and society. The publication by the Royal Society, in 1985, of the Bodmer Report, \u2018The Public Understanding of Science\u2019, marked a turning point in that relationship. The report\u2019s authors identified a range of recommendations but their enduring legacy was a recognition that science itself had to change:\n'Scientists must learn to communicate with the public, be willing to do so, and indeed consider it their duty to do so. All scientists need, therefore, to learn about the media and their constraints and learn how to explain science simply, without jargon and without being condescending. Each sector of the scientific community should consider, for example, providing training on communication and greater understanding of the media, arranging non-specialist lectures and demonstrations, organizing scientific competitions for younger people, providing briefings for journalists and generally by improving their public relations' (1985, p 6).\nA new world of science communication emerged but it was not an easy birth; many scientists felt uncomfortable with being asked to engage with the public and did not see it as \u2018their duty\u2019. A number of initiatives were set up to encourage what was, in essence, a major cultural shift in the way that science and society interacted. Not the least of them was the setting up of the Committee for the Public Understanding of Science (CoPUS).\nBodmer recognised that \u2018Museums are a major informal mechanism for effecting public understanding of science\u2019. In the wake of the report, a number of UK museums and science centres began to experiment with methods of engaging with the public. However, during the post-Bodmer period a number of issues significantly affected the public\u2019s trust in science. Science found itself increasingly portrayed as being secretive or incompetent whenever stories appeared involving the MMR vaccine, nanotechnologies, genetically-modified foods or Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (\u2018mad cow disease\u2019). Much of this public unease was, and continues to be, encouraged by a media which at times might be seen as anti-science.\nA gulf had opened up between scientists and the public and no amount of \u2018public understanding\u2019 initiatives was going to make much difference. At the turn of the century, the House of Lords Select Committee on Science and Technology devoted time to examining the relationship between science and society. The Committee\u2019s Third Report called for a \u2018new mood for dialogue\u2019 (House of Lords Select Committee, 2000, p 37). Whereas PUS was seen as being based on a deficit model of public \u2018ignorance\u2019 (Wynne, 2005), the \u2018dialogue approach\u2019 involved some mutual engagement. A number of strategies evolved to facilitate such engagement:\n'...consultations on a national level, consultations at a local level, deliberative polling, standing consultative panels, focus groups, citizens\u2019 juries, consensus conferences, stakeholder dialogues, Internet dialogues' (Davies et al., 2009, p 339).\nIndeed, it is 20 years since the UK\u2019s first national consensus conference on plant biotechnology took place at the Science Museum. Since then, museums have diversified their approach to engaging the public with science and scientists. The Science Museum and its neighbour, the Natural History Museum (NHM) together attract more than eight million visitors each year. Visitors to the NHM are able to take part in daily Nature Live events (twice daily at the weekends) where one of the museum\u2019s scientists explains some aspect of their work in the David Attenborough studio, which can seat over 60 people. A science communicator (a \u2018host\u2019) is on hand to work with the scientist before and after the session to increase the interactivity of the 45-minute session.\nUnlike the NHM, the Science Museum does not have hundreds of scientists working on-site and so engages the public in different ways. Following the approach pioneered in Paris, the museum created Antenna, \u2018a fully integrated gallery and website that explores the latest news in science, technology, medicine, the environment and innovation\u2019. The approach that Antenna takes is described on the museum website:\n'We don't just give you our take on a story, we interview experts with different viewpoints and we've created a community space where you can share your thoughts through comments, polls and emotional responses [\u2026] Comments made on the web will be displayed on gallery and vice versa, so wherever you are in the world you can be a part of the conversation' (Science Museum, n.d.).\nAnother part of the Science Museum is the Dana Centre, a public event venue aimed at adults that opened in 2003. Whereas the NHM's Nature Live tends to adopt a similar format for most of its sessions, the Dana Centre has developed a wider set of approaches:\n'Enjoy a night of artistic licence as Edinburgh Fringe-style stand-up comics debunk science myths, beatboxers take you on a musical journey all from the mouth and artists use bacteria to generate art. Get hands-on in our test-lab nights. Vent your views in conversation with others at our dialogue events. Or come face-to-face with leading experts in challenging issues facing modern science' (Dana Centre, n.d.).\nResearchers have studied public engagement at Nature Live and at the Dana Centre. Amy Seakins, for example, has spent three years studying the impact that meeting a scientist during a Nature Live session had on museum visitors. Her research, jointly funded by the museum and by King\u2019s College London, involved looking at the questions that members of the public had before the session, immediately after the session and some weeks later. She found a consistent pattern in that before the session, visitors were primarily interested in the topic (for example, meteorites or insects). However, by the end of the session, visitors had become more interested in the scientist themselves and wanted to know more about them and their work. This interest in the scientist remained for at least six to eight weeks after the event.\nTypically the Dana Centre hosts 100 sessions each year with an average attendance of around 60 people. The website, though, receives over 125,000 visits from more than 170 countries. Since its inception, the Dana Centre\u2019s events have been evaluated by members of the Museum\u2019s in-house Audience Research Group, with a focus on exploring what effective dialogue would look like, and how it can be measured. The research included both an 18-month pilot phase where prototype events were evaluated, and three parallel post-graduate level studies on aspects of dialogue.\nHowever, Davies et al. (Davies et al. 2009, p 347) suggest that we should be cautious in our estimation of the effectiveness of the new models of engagement noting that:\n'...dialogue events can in fact quickly revert to traditional question and answer sessions, that events may continue to operate under assumptions of the primacy of scientific knowledge, and that the roles participants assume or have imposed upon them can damage equity. Such problems may \u2013 we suggest \u2013 be due to cultural habit, a lack of clarity among organizers, speakers and other participants with respect to the intended nature of the event, or be based on how the event is policed. Those who 'facilitate, for example, may not be trained or confident in producing this style of interaction. Publics also, it appears, often continue to come to dialogue events with the expectation of learning from experts and deferring to perceived authority.'\nIs it the case, perhaps, that the public doesn\u2019t want to engage with science in the way that some people advocate? No-one can be scientifically literate to such a degree that they can engage knowledgeably on any current science topic, can they? (Bell, 2010) Perhaps people simply want to attend events to learn something new, without being asked to engage in dialogue? Have we really come very far since the 1960s? Are we any closer to a science engagement that promotes \u2018far-reaching changes in economic and social attitudes\u2019? Seakins' work shows that engaging with scientists can change people\u2019s awareness of scientists as human beings, but is that likely to encourage them to challenge science to support social reform and progress?\nWhat is clear, however, is that these initiatives have led to a sea change in how museums engage with non-expert audiences. The Dana Centre evening sessions are paralleled by Lates with MasterCard, which take place in the Science Museum on the last Wednesday of each month from 18.45 until 22.00 \u2013 and for the same young adult, \u2018non-science\u2019 audience:\n'Lates are themed, spanning issues as far apart as sex, alcohol and climate change, but always contain science shows, a pub quiz (see Figure 2), Punk Science comedy shows and the best silent disco in town (underneath real space rockets). Dubbed \u201cdrinking and thinking\u201d by visitors, [\u2026] with DJs and bars on three floors of the museum' (Science Museum, n.d.).\nLates with MasterCard have become a permanent feature in the Science Museum\u2019s calendar, now reaching around 5,000 visitors each evening. Although it has been acknowledged that they are 'largely for people \u201cin the know\u201d connected by social media and friendship groups' (Steiner, 2012, p 3), the reach beyond the \u2018usual suspects\u2019 is encouraging \u2013 60 per cent of 'Lates' visitors are women and more than half have not visited the Science Museum before.\nOther innovations which can trace their origins back to the Dana Centre include Talk Science teacher courses and a number of participation projects, such as involving audiences in curating exhibition cases. During the Museum\u2019s temporary exhibition, Playing with Science, which examined the history of science-related toys, visitors were invited:\n'...to bring in their own toys on a few special weekends. Visitors\u2019 toys were temporarily accessioned into the collection and displayed in a few vitrines at the end of the exhibition. Contributors were photographed with their favorite toy and wrote short statements about them, such as \u201cI play with this toy and pretend to be out in space\u201d, or \u201cI like making girls do boy parts because I am a tomboy\u201d. These visitor contributions personalized the exhibition and helped noncontributing visitors connect to the objects on display by triggering their own toy memories. It also introduced a dynamic element to an otherwise static historical display, thus supporting a light and evolving conversation among visitors, the institution, and the objects themselves' (Simon, n.d.).\nScientists are entering the mix too \u2013 for example the recent Painless Antenna exhibition was co-created by chronic pain sufferers, anaesthetists, and a museum school. There is some evidence that public attitudes towards science are shifting. In April 2010, the Guardian newspaper ran a feature entitled \u2018How science became cool\u2019, explaining that:\n'The incredible ambition of the Large Hadron Collider has fired our imagination; physicists have become cult TV stars; dramatic new pictures from space grace a million computer screensavers. Is this a golden age of science?' (Guardian, 2010).\nPerhaps \u2018golden age\u2019 is an exaggeration but there is no doubt that science is enjoying levels of popularity that are unprecedented. This level of popularity has some benefits \u2013 the leak of emails from British climate change scientists in 2009 did not generate the same type of anti-science media coverage as did earlier \u2018science crises\u2019.\nHopefully benefiting from the \u2018Brian Cox effect' are the UK's relatively large number of science and discovery centres, which host around 20 million visitors each year (Frontier Economics, 2009, ASDC, 2010). However, not everyone is happy with the state of science engagement in the UK \u2013 the Guardian\u2019s \u2018Bad Science\u2019 columnist, Ben Goldacre, is of the opinion that:\n'The indulgent and well-financed \u201cpublic engagement with science\u201d community has been worse than useless, because it too is obsessed with taking the message to everyone, rarely offering stimulating content to the people who are already interested' (Goldacre, 2008, p 321).\nMore criticism comes from the Science for All Expert Group, an independent committee tasked by the government to write an action plan that would, among other things, deliver a shift in cultural awareness, recognition and support for science. In one of seven reports commissioned by the Expert Group, the authors identified deeply-rooted remnants of Snow\u2019s \u2018Two Cultures\u2019:\n'Public engagement remains counter-cultural to the ethos of most public and educational institutions, the civil service and scientific research. Over the last ten years, public engagement has been encouraged; yet the ethos of expert leadership and one-way communication still predominates' (Science for All Expert Group, 2010, p 39).\nBy way of explanation, the Expert Group noted that \u2018we have only partial knowledge of why the public engages, how engagement activities can be most effectively developed and delivered, and what the impact of these events actually is\u2019 (ibid.).\nDespite almost obsessive calls for the sector to demonstrate its \u2018impact\u2019 by policy-makers and funders, the sector has struggled. Even Frontier Economics, \u2018Europe\u2019s leading economic consultancy\u2019, who were commissioned to evaluate the impact of science centres in England on the Government\u2019s Science and Society agenda and to assess whether science centres represented \u2018good value for money in comparison with other STEM-related organisations' (Frontier Economics, 2009, p 2) had to report that:\n'We have not been able to assess whether science centres are good value for money relative to other comparator programmes. This is because there is insufficient evidence on the long term outcomes of science centres or comparator programmes.'\nThe 20 million visitors each year seem to think that they are getting value for money but identifying exactly what impact their visits have is still proving to be elusive. The sector itself has responded to the challenge by devising a number of possible strategies (ASDC, 2010):\n'The methodology we propose first collects the quantitative data, for example, how many adults and children explore science in their leisure time at our centres and how many school students take part in specialised curriculum-supporting workshops. However, we do not believe this alone is sufficient. We must correlate this with the quality of the experience. Thus we propose assessing via three bespoke \u2018impact cards\u2019 targeted at teachers, students or families. The areas of impact we are specifically looking at are within the realm of the GLOs (Generic Learning Outcomes) created by the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council (MLA) and used extensively by most government-funded museums. We also use these cards to explore if visitors feel science and discovery centres are inclusive places, trusted to offer science in an honest manner and in a way that is relevant to everyday life' (ASDC, 2010, p 8).\u00a0So, as I have written elsewhere:\n'The science communication and public engagement sector in the UK is at a crossroads \u2013 it is fragmented, lacking in credible evidence of its success (in the eyes of its critics) and yet intuitively aware that it can make a major contribution to a vision of the world that has at its heart a knowledge that science is seen as society\u2019s greatest cultural asset of the 21st century' (Dillon, 2011, p 7).\nDespite having one of the most well-supported and popular science engagement sectors in the world we are nowhere near to seeing the \u2018far-reaching changes in economic and social attitudes\u2019 that might result from the scientific revolution. However, the ASDC\u2019s focus on exploring \u2018if visitors feel science and discovery centres are inclusive places, trusted to offer science in an honest manner and in a way that is relevant to everyday life\u2019 is very encouraging.\nThe Wellcome Trust, together with a number of US funders, are expected to announce a call for collaborative projects involving museums, science centres and researchers in March 2014. This call is a direct result of Wellcome\u2019s review of the sector, which recommended that \u2018The science learning and engagement system needs support to build its knowledge base of which outcomes to measure and the ways in which they might be measured\u2019 (Falk et al., p 6).\nPartnerships between museums and researchers in the learning sciences already exists in the UK and elsewhere. Building on the work of the ASPIRES project (Archer et al., 2012), the BP-funded Enterprising Science Project at the Science Museum aims to:\n'...build \u201cscience capital\u201d (science-related qualifications, interest, literacy and social contacts) among teachers, students and their families. Our approach involves collaboration between secondary schools, young people (11\u201316 years of age) and their families, and museums and science centres' (King\u2019s College London, n.d.).\nWhile the main focus of the Wellcome call will be on cross-venue learning, assessment, longitudinal studies and developing a culture of reflective research and practice, one hopes that projects will be encouraged that promote social justice and inclusion rather than simply encouraging more people to take up STEM subjects at university and beyond. The scientific\u00a0 revolution promised to us 50 years ago \u2018cannot become a reality unless we are prepared to make far-reaching changes in economic and social attitudes which permeate our whole system of society\u2019. That was the challenge then: it has not gone away."},

Not because it was the first complete recording of a symphony, as that had already been achieved some three years earlier, but because it was the first recording of a complete orchestral work by a world-renowned conductor, now considered to be one of the greatest conductors of all time, together with a leading professional orchestra.[1] What is arguably of equal significance is that it was one of the very first attempts to capture the natural sound of a full orchestra in the studio, and without the substitution of harder-to-record instruments as was commonplace throughout the \u2018acoustic\u2019 period.[2]\u00a0 The recordings are highly successful in this respect, and testimony to the skills of the studio engineers or \u2018experts\u2019 who were working at the very limits of what was feasible using the technology of the period. In acoustic sound recording, musicians play in front of a large tapered horn that channels the sound energy and causes a diaphragm, enclosed in a soundbox or recorder connected to the narrow end of the horn, to vibrate. These vibrations in turn modulate an attached cutting stylus, allowing it to etch an undulating spiral groove on to the surface of a warm wax disc or cylinder, corresponding to the diaphragm vibrations and thus recording the sound information in physical form. Given the challenges of recording in this way, it is not surprising that this version of Beethoven\u2019s Fifth Symphony remains one of few recordings of the early acoustic era that employed such large orchestral forces and without substitution of the lower stringed instruments. In fact the practice of using pared-down ensembles with substituted instrumentation to represent orchestral music would continue until the mid-1920s when there was a wholesale change-over to electrical methods of sound recording.\nAlthough highly lauded during their time and even decades later,[3]\u00a0 acoustic recordings of orchestral music have been routinely dismissed by modern critics as having little or no musical value \u2013 as being a poor indication of how an orchestra from this era would have sounded in the concert hall or through being unfairly compared to later, electronically recorded versions.[4] The limitations of acoustic recording \u2013 the lack of low and high frequency bandwidth, narrow dynamic range, missing timbral detail and the accompanying surface noises \u2013 are today perceived as a barrier to the appreciation of these records. Yet historically they represent a transformation in the way we have come to listen to recorded music as well as being extraordinary achievements in the technical field of sound engineering.[5] By understanding how these recordings were made \u2013 the contemporary studio practices and musicians\u2019 working environment \u2013 we can better appreciate the musicianship and artistry that went into their making. A practical re-enactment of an acoustic recording session would therefore yield valuable information and help promote such an understanding, with both technical and musical aspects and their interrelation being closely observed and documented. To this end, a re-enactment of the Nikisch and BPO\u2019s recording of Beethoven\u2019s Fifth Symphony was staged at the Royal College of Music, London, in November 2014, using a chamber orchestra of comparable size to that used by the BPO in 1913.[6]\nThe historical re-enactment is an important means through which we can engage with the past and investigate forgotten practices and skills. In this case, to borrow from Roger Kneebone\u2019s advocacy of scientific re-enactment, it is used \u2018to recapture the tacit dimensions of experimental practices\u2019 (Kneebone and Woods, 2014, p 111). The \u2018learning by doing\u2019 aspect of a re-enactment has educational value too: the student musicians participating in the recordings at the RCM not only step into their predecessors\u2019 shoes, but they are also educated in the practice, process and context of acoustic recording (Kneebone and Woods, 2014, p 111).\nWhile re-enactments of acoustic recordings have taken place before, they have focused exclusively on small groups or soloists with accompaniment and have been recorded on to wax cylinders or occasionally on to modern, commercially manufactured lacquer discs.[7] The RCM re-enactment is the first time since 1925 that an orchestra has been recorded acoustically on to blank wax discs, originally used as masters for the production of gramophone records.\nThis article begins with an examination of the historical context and cultural significance of the original 1913 recordings. It goes on to describe the process and methodology of this re-enactment, including a detailed account of the technical aspects and the manufacture of the blank wax discs. A comparison of modern and acoustic recordings of the orchestra follows, including a discussion of the student musicians\u2019 experiences, the challenges involved and the effect this method of sound recording had on the performers and their music-making. In conclusion, we reflect on the outcomes of the re-enactment and how our findings have deepened our understanding of the art and science of acoustic recording."},

But in the early modern mind the Tower evoked a more varied range of associations. In his renowned early seventeenth-century Survey of London, historian John Stow wrote of how:\nThis tower is a Citadell, to defend or commaund the Citie: a royall place for assemblies, and treaties. A Prison of estate, for the most daungerous offenders: the onely place of coynage for all England at this time: the armorie for warlike prouision: the Treasurie of the ornaments and Jewels of the crowne, and generall conseruer of the most Recordes of the kings Courts of iustice at Westminster (Stow, 1908, Vol 1, p 59).\nThe impression we get from Stow\u2019s account \u2013 written when the White Tower, the largest and most ancient building in the Tower complex was about five hundred years old \u2013 is of a highly significant, multifunctional urban site, deeply embedded within collective local and national memory and historical cultures.\nWithin its walls the early modern Tower of London encompassed, among other institutions, the Mint (where money was made, and precious metals tested and refined), the Ordnance Office (responsible for procurement and storage of munitions and provision of buildings required by the armed forces), and the Royal Menagerie (a space for housing and viewing \u2018wild Savage Creatures\u2019) (Parnell, 1993, p 54; Strype, 1720, I.xx.118). These varied Tower institutions employed hundreds of skilled practitioners and technicians, who undertook practices of testing, measurement, and material observation and production which we might categorise as productive \u2018scientific\u2019 activities. Many of these Tower employees lived as well as worked on site, blurring boundaries between domestic, institutional and operational spaces. Moreover, the Tower acted as a kind of magnet for expertise, drawing in skilled practitioners \u2013 relating to the testing of metals, the manufacturing of coins and weapons, the welfare and reproduction of animals \u2013 from across London, Britain, and Europe more broadly. The Tower was also a tourist destination for affluent and well-connected foreign travellers and dignitaries. By the late sixteenth century, prosperous visitors paid Tower warders for tours, and there were customary routes through the expansive institutional complex, which typically took in the Royal Mint, Armouries, Jewel House, and the exotic animals in the Menagerie. More humble local visitors from the surrounding city came to observe the lions at close quarters, perhaps from as early as the thirteenth century (Deiter, 2008, pp 48, 53\u221254, 34). After the Restoration, recreational visits to the Tower greatly increased, with fee-paying visitors taking in the Menagerie, Armouries and the dazzling crown jewels (Hahn, 2003, p 122). Within this busy and crowded site from the thirteenth century was the Royal Mint, the primary institution in England for the production of silver and gold coin. Its officials and moneyers \u2018were incorporated as \u201cone body perpetual\u201d with the right to use their own common seal, to hold land, and to sue in any court\u2019 (Challis, 1992, p 184). The Mint has typically been framed in terms of its institutional politics, flows of bullion, and specific levels of coin production, but it was also a significant urban space of technical knowledge and industrious labour and, at certain moments, experimental practice. It was a royal institution within which labourers, artisans, technical experts, institutional officials and gentlemen interacted. These varied social orders had a shared interest in metallurgy, and the production and testing of coin more specifically. Here we consider the Mint as a space of skilled knowledge exchange.The built environment of the Mint consisted of a series of structures which gradually spread, by the end of the fifteenth century, to fill the narrow space between the inner and outer walls of the Tower. The most significant Mint buildings were situated along Mint Street, which ran from Byward Tower to Legge\u2019s Mount. In addition to workshops were stores, stables, coach houses, domestic residences, and even gardens (Challis, 1978, pp 1\u22123; Craig, 1946, p 1). It is very likely that the varied workshop processes at the Mint, for example those of assaying, melting and weighing, were undertaken in different \u2018houses\u2019 (or certainly, at least, separate chambers). The pronounced separation of the different workshop practices of coin production and testing was no doubt partly a practical measure, but the spatial organisation of the Royal Mint perhaps also held a deeper symbolic significance. As with Italian Mint architecture, \u2018the presence of distinct spaces within the Mint for different types of activity reassured coin users that the materiality of coins had not been compromised, and thus inculcated confidence in the monetary system\u2019 (Jacobi, 2019, p 74).Those employed at the Tower Mint engaged in a range of different activities and were expert in a variety of technical knowledges. Workers included weighers (who calculated the weight of metals brought into the Mint), melters (who liquefied the bullion), refiners, engravers, assayers and moneyers (\u2018who are, some to sheer the Money, some to forge it; some to beat it broad, some to round it, and some to stamp or coin it\u2019) (Strype, 1720, I.xviii.96). Frustratingly, there are very few archival traces for the moneyers of the Tower, who fashioned the blanks and struck the coins. It is likely that they formed a craft fellowship or guild from around the mid-fifteenth century, providing training for apprentices and mutual support (Freeman, 2000; Challis, 1975). Moneyers\u2019 Hall was situated within the Tower site for their collective socialising and administration (visible in Figure 4 below) (Challis, 1992, p 363). Pointedly, in the archival records of the Mint, seventeenth-century workers in coin specifically referred to their labour as \u2018industry\u2019 or \u2018industrious\u2019.[1] By this they were emphasising the ingenious and skilful elements of their practice.[2]At the Assay House, probably located at the north-west corner of the Tower, were men responsible for testing the precious metal content of ores, bullion, coinage, and plate; assayers were a highly significant group of skilled artisans at the Tower site. Assay by fire involved an experiential understanding of many workshop variables, including furnace temperatures, and the malleability of metals. All metals brought into the Mint were assayed before being melted down for coin production, and after minting, batches of coins were assayed to ensure they were of the correct weight and fineness. At the annual Trial of the Pyx the integrity of the institution and the expertise of the master assayer were put to the test (Kilburn-Toppin, 2019, pp 5, 15, 20). This highly ceremonial testing process at the court of Star Chamber at Westminster involved the assay of a sample of coins produced at the Mint by a jury of experienced goldsmiths, to ensure the coinage met the standards set by the Crown.[3] Engaged in the separation and transformation of matter, assayers and the affairs of their workshops were a curiosity for those interested in the secrets of nature, material trials, or experiments. The Assay House at the Royal Mint was a specific site of curiosity. Merchant and economic writer Gerard Malynes reported in 1622 that \u2018coming to the Assay-house [within the Tower liberties], there we found diuers gentlemen desirous to see the manner of making of Assayes of Gold and Siluer\u2019 (Malynes, 1622, Vol 1, p 284).\nThe Royal Mint was a productive and experimental urban space that had a complicated relationship with secrecy. The drive for secrecy operated at a number of institutional, social, political and cultural levels. The operations of the Mint were meant to be secret, a form of \u2018intentionally concealed\u2019 technical knowledge, understood and observed by only a select group of royal officials and employees (Long, 2001, p 7). This was an era in which \u2018coinage was regarded as a crucial state secret, and the ability to handle and keep secrets was therefore indispensable\u2019 (J\u00fctte, 2015, p 104). This secret approach was closely linked to fears of counterfeit currency. Further, the arts of metalworkers were craft mysteries, which were not to be observed or repeated by the uninitiated. This was part of a broader late-medieval and early modern urban culture of \u2018proprietary attitudes towards craft knowledge\u2019 (Long, 2001, p 1). And yet, we find that the everyday reality could be quite different. The site had seemingly porous boundaries; movement through the Mint was hard to control, and those with the right social connections might gain legitimate access to view operational practices and personnel. A handful of its workers also authored seemingly revelatory \u2018books of secrets\u2019.Sensitivities on the part of English royal and institutional elites concerning the discussion of bullion, coin, and procedures for their regulation were especially heightened at certain moments, for example, following the mid sixteenth-century monetary debasements or when new production techniques were introduced, as in the 1660s recoinage. This led to spaces associated with coinage and the machinery they contained becoming increasingly regulated. When the Parisian engineer Pierre Blondeau was employed at the Mint for the purpose of mechanising the coinage of the newly crowned Charles II he was sworn only \u2018to discover his Secrets in rounding the pieces before they are sized, and in making the edges of the moneys with letters and grayvings\u2019 to officers of the Mint and \u2018unto his Majesty if he shall please to do him the Honour of being a witness unto his Art and Inventions\u2019.[4] Blondeau had previously visited the Interregnum Mint from 1649 with an \u2018innovative device\u2019 of \u2018an edge-marking process\u2019 for newly minted coins, but he was not formally employed by the Commonwealth (Challis, 1992, pp 329\u221230). Blondeau had his own ideas about the imperative of secrecy, closely linked to the desire to protect his invention of an edge-marking process. He expressed these preferences for concealed technology in print in the early 1650s in a series of bitter exchanges with the corporation of moneyers at the Mint. The French engineer wrote of how \u2018the Invention needs not be made publick; But if it be the pleasure of the State, the Engines wherewith the brims are marked, may be kept secret among few men, who shall be sworn to keep it, and not to reveal it to anie\u2019. Blondeau stressed that since his arrival in England two years previously (September 1649), \u2018the Officers and Workmen of the Mint have made their utmost endeavours to finde out my Invention, which they could not attain unto, although the Master of the Mint hath had in his hands 10 my Patterns above nine moneths together\u2019. Besides, he claimed the moneyers at the Mint had entreated the royal committee \u2018that I should bee commanded to make a new tryal here, hoping they should be able to discover my secret [\u2026] but they could not\u2019. Indeed, when it came to a competitive trial between Pierre Blondeau and David Ramage (on behalf of the moneyers), the former produced a much higher quantity and quality of coin, though \u2018while the Commonwealth lasted, he remained without formal employment at the Mint\u2019 (Challis, 1992, p 330). The institutional ideal of secrecy surrounding the production of coinage and testing of metals was reflected and reinforced through security measures at the Tower site. A porter was employed at the Mint, specifically to regulate the movement of people and goods in and out of the office of receipt, the chamber to which customers (typically merchants and goldsmiths) brought their bullion (Challis, 1992, pp 268, 286). The degree to which this official was also required to regulate the movement and potential indiscretions of institutional employees is reflected in a statement by the officers of the Mint in December 1664:\nthat in Order to the preserving of the Reputation of his Majestys said Mint and the better securing the money and bullion of Gold and Silver from time to time delivered into his Majesty\u2019s Office of Receipt in the Mint, there ever was, and still is a Porter appointed to take accompt of all persons repairing thither and (with the Assistance of some of the Monyers) to search dayly in his lodge (in times of coyning) workmen at their going out and all suspicious persons as also to stop all such moneyers or workmen as should depart to leave their work before the hours appointed or allowed them.[5]\nHowever, effectively managing the movement of people and objects through the Tower complex proved to be an immense challenge in the early modern period, in large measure because of the multifunctionality of the site, and the social diversity of its working population. Correspondingly, particular groups and institutional workers were keen to assert their free movement through the building complex and associated privileged statuses. And thus, in December 1664, officers of the Mint were eager to remind royal governors that they had always:\nhad a particular and distinct Jurisdiction and Authority within themselves independent of the Constable or Lieutenant of the Tower and of the Master and Officers of the Ordnance with free Ingress, Egress, and Regress at all times for themselves and Servants [\u2026] without any disturbance, letting or gainsaying.[6]\nMoreover, despite the existence of the porter at the Mint, the illicit movement of people and material things (specifically tools) was clearly taking place; the regularity with which prohibitions of movement were repeated in the Mint records is itself highly suggestive of the continuation of forbidden practices. We see this concern of illicit traffic manifest with particular intensity during the 1660s, coinciding with the mechanisation of the new coinage. The central anxiety on the part of Mint officials was evidently counterfeiting. In January 1661/62 in relation to the \u2018fabrick of money by way of press or screw [the mechanisation of the coinage] and the preventing of Abuses therein\u2019 it was decreed \u2018that no Graver or Gravers whatsoever shall henceforth grave or work any original master puncheons, matrices, stamps and dyes, or any irons for coyning either by way of the press or hammer in any place but in his majestys mint in the Tower of London\u2019. More explicitly, it was stressed that \u2018for the better preventing the Counterfeiting of the new current moneys of this Kingdom\u2019, moneyers were not permitted to \u2018keep or use any of the Presses, Cutters, or any other Tools or Engines employed in the new way of Coyning or in the making of the moneys with cutters or grayvings about the edges\u2019. If \u2018such presses, rowlers and other tools and engines\u2019 were found outside the site of the Mint, they were to be seized, secured and destroyed by its officers.[7] Regular inventories were also made of coining workshops, in an attempt to keep track of their material contents. Aside from the distinct possibility of tools being smuggled out of the Mint workshops, there was also the issue of managing the broader population of the Mint site. We noted earlier how the Mint had spread by this date to encompass the entire outer horseshoe complex between the walls of the Tower. In the early 1660s the officers of the Mint gave \u2018a particular accompt of all persons who have Intruded and now Inhabit within the Mint or precincts thereof and have no relation thereunto\u2019.[8] These were clearly individuals and families that had no particular employment at the Mint. Several years later, in 1664, there were further complaints of \u2018many incroachments made upon the Jurisdictions and Libertys of his Majesty\u2019s said mint\u2019, which were said to diminish the reputation of the institution and to act as a \u2018great danger and prejudice of his Majesty\u2019s Officers and moneyers there by the keeping of common drinking houses and building of workhouses, sheds, and forges for wheelrights, carpenters and smiths etc.\u2019.[9] There was evidently a double concern at play here. First, the unease that these spaces, their activities and persons were largely unregulated; second, that these structures were taking up space which was now urgently needed for Mint activities and personnel to accommodate new coining equipment. It was ordered by the royal council that \u2018all persons using or inhabiting any lodgings or houses situate or being between the two Mint Gates of the Mint\u2019 should \u2018remove themselves and their families\u2019.[10] This was said to be \u2018for the better security of our said Mint, and for the accommodating of such other officers and workemen as hereafter shalbe employed in the making of Tooles and Engine, and in Coyning our Moneys by the Mill and Presse\u2019.[11]\nThe distinct concern that the Mint site was overcrowded and thus unregulated and insecure continued into the next decade. In 1679 Sir Henry Slingsby, Master of the Mint warned of the:\ndangers and hazards which may happen by reason of the great concourse of people [\u2026] inhabiting within the said Mint (though not belonging to it) especially to the smith of the Ordnance who making all sorts of Iron work there do dayly cause the crowding up of ye Mint w[i]th land and sea carriages, and the drawing number of carpenters, painters, and other workmen thither.[12]\nHere we see how the multifunctionality of the Tower site impacted upon the industrious and tightly regulated activities of the Mint. As a result of Slingsby\u2019s complaint the royal council \u2018viewed the several parts of the mint\u2019, \u2018examined the Rights and Boundarys therof\u2019, and found that the smith employed by the Ordnance Office was indeed \u2018dwelling and working in ye mint and making and fitting double headed shott, and all sorts of Iron work for that service\u2019. This industry had resulted in:\na great and dayly concourse of people thither the crowding it up with land and sea carriages and the drawing a great number of Carpenters, Wheelrights, Painters and other workmen to your Majesty\u2019s mint which is thereby rendered as publick as the common streets and lyable to many dangers losses and Inconveniencys.[13]\nThe allegedly \u2018public\u2019 nature of the Mint site in the 1670s was in clear contrast to the institutional ideal of a closely managed, concealed space. There was additionally a social dynamic at work which complicated the principle of secrecy associated with the Royal Mint, and this relates to curious visitors. The activities of refining and testing metals, and the newly mechanised coining process were of considerable interest to those we might broadly define as gentlemen natural philosophers. There is evidence to suggest that men with the right social and institutional connections might gain access to Mint workshops associated with monetary production and metallurgical testing. On Tuesday 19 May 1663, Samuel Pepys (soon to become a fellow and, later, president of the Royal Society), thoroughly enjoyed a social and investigative visit to the Tower Mint, together with a naval associate. A personal friend of Sir Henry Slingsby, Pepys recorded in his diary how he was:\nshown the method of making this new money, from the beginning to the end, which is so pretty that I did take a note of every part of it and set them down by themselves for my remembrance hereafter. [\u2026] and after dinner went to the Assay Office and there saw the manner of assaying of gold and silver, and how silver melted down with gold do part, just being put into aqua-fortis, the silver turning into water, and the gold lying whole in the very form it was put in, mixed of gold and silver, which is a miracle\u2026 (Pepys, 2013, 1663/05/19).\nTellingly, Pepys described the process as both an \u2018experiment\u2019 and a \u2018mystery\u2019. The Tower Mint was a significant space for material production, transformation and investigation in the early modern metropolis. Understanding its complex knowledge culture requires paying close attention to the physical built environment, and the movement of people and things (including tools and coins) through the space. The socially complex, physically expansive and multifunctional nature of the Tower site impacted upon its institutional culture of secrecy. Built environment and knowledge culture were here mutually constitutive."},

The instrument trade was a craft industry right up to 1800. There were a small number of large workshops towards the end of the period under review, but most instruments were produced by craftsmen and their families, often assisted by a few apprentices and paid employees. The family usually lived on the premises, which made it easier for the women to become involved. Women played an active role in the making and retailing of instruments and therefore contributed to the supply of devices and apparatus from London to individuals and organisations within the city and beyond. Those women who were most visible in the instrument trades were widows who carried on their late husband\u2019s business. This is well known to historians and was not unique to the instrument trade. It was a common practice in other crafts and Fullwood and Allnutt (2019) have begun to fully explore this in the clock and watchmaking trade, revealing hitherto unfamiliar names of active female clockmakers and watchmakers in the period. Yet the extent of their involvement in the day-to-day running of the business, both before and after their husband\u2019s death in the period 1650\u20131800 specifically has not been fully explored before. This apparent gap in the historical record is probably the result of a lack of supporting evidence. In fact, as this paper will show, records such as newspaper advertisements, financial records and entries in trade directories show that widows often continued to use their husband\u2019s name on instruments produced in the workshop. While the widows may be invisible in the material record, the dates of the associated archival material and of their husband\u2019s death reveals their presence and thus contribution.Fara (2005, p 48) claims that the role of women in the family business was not merely participatory, but powerful in that they were involved in all aspects of the business, both learning how to make instruments and supervising financial transactions. Their involvement was not casual; many lived and breathed the craft. Some girls were taken on as apprentices or were trained by their fathers. As young adults, they often married the owners of other shops and then took them over when their husband died, indicating their key contribution to craft networks.Clifton (1995) has so far traced the names of 58 women who worked in London during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries as sellers or makers of scientific instruments in the broadest sense, ranging from mathematical instrument makers to lens grinders and scale and weight makers. In that which follows, we consider the examples of female instrument makers, who were based in London, each of whom is significant in her own way as a representative of the contribution made by women as craftspeople within a male-dominated trade. Following on from these individuals, we consider the existence of women as component-makers to the trade, who were an important link in the supply chain, many of whom are nameless or referred to in single entries in guild records.\nWe begin our exploration of women as instrument makers with Mary Edwards. Mary was married to the spectacle maker, Richard Edwards. She took on his apprentice, John Yarwell, when Richard died in late 1667 or early 1668. Yarwell would become one of the leading optical instrument makers in London in the late-seventeenth century. In April 1668, Mary applied to the Worshipful Company of Spectaclemakers, the guild governing the optical-instrument making trade in the City, to take an additional apprentice, but this was refused as John still had 21 months of his apprenticeship to serve, having been indentured in December 1662. Mary continued to pay quarterly fees to the Company during 1668 but then turned John over to Nicholas Shield to complete his training. Though not formally admitted to the Company, widows like Mary acted as Freeman in practice and were accepted as such by members, paying Company fees and taking on apprentices.[4] As with most of the women discussed in this paper, little else is known about Mary, but her example sheds light on the relationship of women with the guilds in the seventeenth century. They were tolerated and accepted by the guilds, who recognised that the trade needed them, even if they were not fully inaugurated.\nJane Hayes was married to Walter Hayes, a mathematical instrument maker whose workshop was located at the sign of the cross daggers in Moorfields. Walter was a member of two London guilds, the Worshipful Company of Grocers and the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers. He died in late 1687 or early 1688, leaving the bulk of his estate to Jane, who continued the family business as Mary Edwards had done some twenty years earlier. Jane, like Mary Edwards, seems to have taken on her late husband\u2019s apprentices. While there is no formal record of this in either the Grocers\u2019 or Clockmakers\u2019 records, the dates for Edmund Culpeper\u2019s training seem to fit this suggestion. Edmund, who would become one of London\u2019s leading mathematical and optical instrument makers, began his seven-year apprenticeship with Walter in 1684. This would take his completion date to around 1691, indicating that following Walter\u2019s death he completed his training under Jane\u2019s management from at least 1688 to 1691. Unlike the Spectaclemakers whom Mary served, it would appear that the Grocers\u2019 Company did not object to a woman formally training an apprentice.Nearly a decade after Walter\u2019s death, Jane is known to have supplied mathematical instruments to Christ\u2019s Hospital Mathematical School in 1696 and 1697, but presumably passed the day-to-day running of the shop in Moorfields shortly after this to Edmund, who was recorded as trading at that address by 1700. However, it is noteworthy that Jane seems to have retained ownership of the business making mathematical instruments, for when she died in 1710 she left a detailed will in which her address was still given as Moorfields and she bequeathed to: \u2018Mr Edmond Culpeper my late servant all my Shop Goods and Tools and Loadstone belonging to the Trade of a Mathematical Instrument Maker and also all my Mathematical Books and the Copy of Gunters Quadrant Book.\u2019[5]Jane\u2019s example shows a slightly different relationship between a seventeenth-century woman and the City guilds, indicative of how the latter managed their trade slightly differently. It also shows us a little about the experience of women within the craft, whom they supplied and how they chose to manage or divide the business.\nMary Senex was married to the highly-successful globe maker, John Senex, and took over his business when he died in 1740. Unlike the majority of widows in a similar position who sold their businesses after a year or so, Mary, similarly to Jane Hayes over 40 years earlier, ran hers for 15 years (Clifton, 1995, p 248). Like Jane, Mary also supplied instruments, but in her case globes, to Christ\u2019s Hospital Mathematical School. This was clearly an important client and one that several widows were keen to maintain. What makes Mary stand out from the other widows considered here was her talent for marketing and protecting her concerns. Mary advertised her instruments in catalogues such as that seen in Figure 4. While it is very likely that she helped to make many globes that bear John\u2019s signature, a pair have been positively identified that were made after John\u2019s death and must have been made by Mary or at the very least under her direction (see Figure 5). As mentioned above, it was common for widowed makers to continue to use their husband\u2019s signature on the instruments they sold \u2013 acting as a form of continuity and consequently a source of trustworthiness for customers, many of whom would probably have doubted its quality had they known a woman made it. Besides routinely advertising through trade cards and catalogues[6], Mary actively promoted the globes and other goods she sold. In 1749 she became concerned about competition from imported globes and wrote to the Royal Society pointing out that her late husband\u2019s globes, which she sold, were more accurate than their foreign competitors. Her letter was published in the Society\u2019s Philosophical Transactions.[7]Mary eventually sold the copper plates for making all of the globes (except the three-inch variety) to the natural philosophy lecturer James Ferguson in 1755, and they were later sold to fellow lecturer and instrument-maker Benjamin Martin in 1757 (Dekker, p 332). This is indicative of how valuable the plates were, not only financially, but in terms of the knowledge they contained and the extent to which this could be transformed into a successful commercial product. It is no wonder that Mary continued the family business for as long as she did. She provides us with a powerful example of a female instrument maker who not only continued the family business, but who brought her own personality to its operation \u2013 fighting for it in many corners.Ann and Hannah Adams, the wives of the hugely successful George Adams the Elder and George the Younger, provide us with a significant example of not only widows who continued the business of their husbands, but also a representation of women who had to possess good business nous \u2013 not unlike Mary Senex \u2013 who had the capability to act quickly when their husbands died and who were compelled to consider the wider family network when they made decisions. These were not wives who were out of touch with the business and the market, but highly engaged members of a family concern who knew how to respond to different challenges.Ann was the second wife of George Adams the Elder and the mother of George the Younger. While no evidence exists of her having made instruments while her husband was alive, it is very likely that she did. This seems plausible given that, as Millburn (1976, p 161) informs us, only days after her husband\u2019s funeral in October 1772 and when her son, George the Younger, had only very recently completed his apprenticeship, she placed this advertisement in at least three London newspapers (the Daily Advertiser, the Gazetteer and the New Daily Advertiser):\nANN and GEORGE ADAMS, Mathematical Instruments Makers to his Majesty, &amp;c., at Tycho Brahe\u2019s Head, No.60, in Fleet Street, beg leave to acquaint the Nobility, Gentry, Merchants, and others, that they continue to carry on the business of the late Mr Adams, in the Mathematical, Philosophical, and Optical branches, as in his lifetime, and humbly solicit the continuance of their former favours. Those gentlemen and ladies who honour us with their custom, may depend on their orders being executed with the utmost fidelity, accuracy, and dispatch. Of whom may be had all sorts of instruments in the various sciences of the Mathematics, Philosophy, Astronomy, Geography, Geometry, Drawing, Surveying, Navigation, &amp;c. each of the most perfect construction, and at the most reasonable rates.[8]\nNot only was Ann quick to strategically place her advertisement, which was intended to act as both a sign of trustworthiness and a call for further orders, but she also ensured that the practical work was carried out. Millburn (1976, p 161) informs us that ledgers indicate that the business continued to supply instruments to Christ\u2019s Hospital Mathematical School in this period, similarly to Jane Hayes and Mary Senex several decades earlier. It is likely that Ann did undertake some of the practical work. One microscope that was recently sold at auction[9] bears the signature \u2018A &amp; G Adams\u2019, which may be the only surviving example from this period in the history of the business and the only one to bear Ann\u2019s signature. Ann also tried to secure the continuation of the Ordnance Office contract, but was not successful. Before George\u2019s will was proved, rival instrument maker Jeremiah Sisson had petitioned for the appointment to be passed to him and was awarded it. This demonstrates how competitive the market was and how widows needed an aptitude for business to be able to keep afloat. The Adams family managed to re-attain the contract by the late 1770s due to Jeremiah\u2019s bankruptcy in 1775.\nIn 1774, George Adams the Younger married Hannah and the era of the Adams\u2019 mother-and-son partnership presumably came to an end. However, Ann\u2019s influence did not entirely end there. She ensured that her youngest son, Dudley, had an income. The details of the elder George\u2019s will meant that his holdings were legally Ann\u2019s to do with as she pleased. Of course, anything that was the younger George\u2019s was his, but Ann made the deliberate decision to safeguard Dudley\u2019s interests by giving him his father\u2019s globe making equipment so that he could set up on his own at Charing Cross after the completion of his apprenticeship to his brother.Hannah was as shrewd as Ann and when her own husband George the Younger died in 1795, she acted as quickly as her mother-in-law had done some 23 years earlier. Within a fortnight she had been appointed mathematical instrument maker to the King, continuing her late husband\u2019s endorsement. Similarly to Ann, it is likely that she helped to physically make instruments. Millburn (1976, p 265) informs us that a barometer has survived which bears her signature, although its present location is unknown. The example of Hannah Adams is a noteworthy one. Apart from being a widow who continued the family business, as many other women did in this period, her experience is different simply because of the surviving family members \u2014 her mother-in-law Ann and her brother-in-law Dudley. George the Younger\u2019s will left the business on Fleet Street, his stocks, copyright of his books and shares in various properties to Hannah. This might seem simple enough, but uncertainty remained concerning those elements that were not strictly speaking the legal property of the younger George. This was because everything that had been George the Elder\u2019s on his death was still under Ann\u2019s management and her interests surely lay with Dudley, whom she may have hoped would marry and continue the family line, rather than with the childless Hannah. It is unknown whether Hannah clashed with Ann, but she certainly did with Dudley. Following the younger George\u2019s death, they both wrote to the Office of Ordnance asking to take over George\u2019s appointment as instrument supplier. Dudley was granted the contract, but lost it in 1806. Despite this setback, Hannah continued to supply Christ\u2019s Hospital Mathematical School, which Dudley did not challenge her for. Perhaps to raise some funds, she decided to sell the library at Fleet Street in 1796, which contained approximately 2,000 volumes. Dudley later remarked that he had felt vexed by this. While he did not act to halt the sale, his comments indicate that he was not on the best of terms with his sister-in-law. The relationships between individuals within an instrument-making family were clearly as significant for the supply chain as those between makers within the wider network.\nSarah Ramsden, the only one of the seven women considered in this section whose maiden name is known, grew up in an instrument-making household of high repute. Her father was John Dollond, celebrated as the inventor of the achromatic lens. At the age of 23 Sarah married Jesse Ramsden, who was a neighbour of the Dollonds and dined with them in the early days of his career. Far from unusual, it was noted above that many daughters of instrument makers went on to marry other instrument makers and this was often a strategic move to expand immediate networks. During her marriage to Jesse, we know that she helped with the physical aspects of the craft (McConnell, 2007, p 23). Referring to Jesse\u2019s first dividing engine, which was sent to France in 1775, a Jean Hyacinthe de Magellan commented in a letter to a Mr Mallet that even Jesse\u2019s wife operated it: \u2018...cette machine dans laquelle travaillaient les \u00e9l\u00e8ves et meme quelque fois la femme de Ramsden.\u2019 (\u2018This machine on which students worked and sometimes even Ramsden\u2019s wife.\u2019)[10] In the context of this period, the reference was used to demonstrate how easy the machine was to operate rather than as praise to Sarah, given that the reference to her followed that to his apprentices. While the dividing engine may indeed have been easy to operate, given her background, it is more than likely that Sarah was involved in many more aspects of the craft than was recorded or has survived.We get a glimpse of this from what we know of her life once she separated from Jesse. This unusual situation for its time provides us with a valuable insight into the part played by women in the rise of the instrument-making trade and is slightly different from the other examples discussed here of widows who continued the family business after their husbands died. The reason behind the separation is unknown, but may have had something to do with the falling out between her father, John, and Jesse over the achromatic lens patent. Whatever the cause, we know that Sarah was living separately from Jesse, and crucially with their son John, certainly by 1786, but probably by 1784. In the years that followed, Sarah acted as a retailer, or middleman, between Giuseppe Poli and Matthew Boulton \u2013 corresponding with the latter in order to supply a steam engine to the former (McConnell, 2007, p 251). We know that Sarah acted as broker for Giuseppe for other supplies \u2013 he wrote to Joseph Banks on 2 March 1784 asking Joseph to pass a medal to Mrs Ramsden who would make the payment for him. Aside from her own work, we know that she also assisted her brothers with their optical work in this period \u2013 both their practical work and their accounts. The example of Sarah gives us an indication of the role played by female members of the family business in its running even when the men were still alive. Returning to help her brothers after the collapse of her marriage gives us an unusual insight into the probable role played by unmarried sisters and daughters within other workshops.The contribution of some women is only visible in short references within the archives of the City Livery Companies. One of the purposes of trade guilds was to regulate the standard of goods produced and maintain the reputation of their craft. In order to do so, senior figures carried out searches in the City of London and seized faulty goods, not just from guild members but also from others making or selling items which came under a particular guild\u2019s supervision. They also sought to ensure that all apprentices had been properly bound through the guild. Some of the records of these searches reveal women\u2019s involvement in making scientific instruments, or indeed their components, such as lenses. The Spectaclemakers\u2019 Company records include a detailed account of a search made on 16 September 1670. It reported that in Bishopsgate they searched the premises of Mrs Jenkinson, where they found nothing worthy of comment, but at \u2018Widdow Cosby, Spectaclemaker one bad paire rased\u2019. A little earlier, in 1668, John Cosby was bound apprentice to Alice Cosby, \u2018widdow and his Mother a Spectaclemaker\u2019, so clearly she ran the business for a while and may have been minding it until her son was old enough to take over. At another search, in 1691, at Ralph Harbottle\u2019s house in Deane Street, the Company\u2019s representatives \u2018found John Harbottle his Son at Worke grinding Glasses for Spectacles alsoe a Woman grinding at another Toole...\u2019.[11]Some spectacle-lens grinders also produced lenses for telescopes and microscopes. Occasionally, women were apprenticed to instrument makers. For instance, in 1737 Susannah Passavant became the apprentice of George Willdey, optical instrument maker, and was later made a Freeman of the Spectaclemakers\u2019 Company. She eventually had her own \u2018Toy Shop\u2019, which in the eighteenth century usually sold pocket telescopes (polemoscopes) for use at the theatre, as well as other small decorative items, as indicated by a trade card in the Heal Collection at the British Museum. She continued to pay the customary quarterly fees to the Spectaclemakers\u2019 Company until 1761.[12]The Clockmakers\u2019 Company claimed authority over mathematical instrument makers, who made all kinds of measuring instruments, including rules and sundials. They too conducted searches to check that their regulations were followed and that the quality of the instruments was satisfactory. During a search on 21 February 1671/2, they seized from Mr Charles Danley, a seller of canes in Fleet Street, \u2018two sundialls for posts, affirmed by him made or sold to him by Widow Cator\u2019.[13]While references to the female component makers may appear small and insignificant, they represent a larger issue. Firstly, that these workers were not considered important enough to record unless they represented a problem to the trade. Secondly, while effectively nameless, their contribution to the trade was huge. Large numbers of instruments would not have been produced so quickly \u2013 which enabled the London trade to become one of global significance \u2013 without their work, which means their contribution was fundamental.In this section we have seen that female craftspeople made a very real contribution to the growth of the instrument-making trade in London in the period. The trade may have been dominated by men, but its functioning, success and survival were very much the results of a collaborative effort despite the fact that most women were unacknowledged formally, which was due to the perceived role of women in society and business more generally. We have shown that where widows continued their husband\u2019s business, it was not a simple matter of continuing to open the doors every day and keeping a record of orders; it took a lot of hard work and strategic thinking to maintain a successful business in this very competitive market. By considering the six individuals above, it has become clear that there were several core business activities that they carried out (the same as their late husbands would have done and male counterparts in the wider network did). They maintained existing contracts, which Jane Hayes, Mary Senex and Hannah Adams did with Christ\u2019s Hospital Mathematical School. It was beneficial to keep training existing apprentices and to take on new ones, as we saw Mary Edwards try to do with John Yarwell and Jane Hayes with her late husband\u2019s apprentices. Securing new customers and contracts was essential. Each of the women considered here provide a good example of maintaining existing contracts. Sarah Ramsden provides a particularly insightful example of women securing new work in her role as a supply agent working between Giuseppe Poli on the one hand and Matthew Boulton and Joseph Banks on the other. Advertising was another essential aspect of their work. We saw how Mary Senex made effective use of trade cards and both Ann and Hannah Adams used newspaper advertisements to their advantage. Operating in a city where businesses went bankrupt or were outperformed by others required our individuals, both men and women alike, to protect their concerns. We saw strong examples of this with Mary Senex who wrote to the Royal Society about her concerns and Ann and Hannah Adams who each acted quickly and strategically after their husband\u2019s death. A significant ingredient that made all of the above easier was the ability to network both within the trade and outside. Mary Edwards provides a good example of a widow who made use of her guild network \u2013 acting as a Freeman in practice even though she was not admitted. Mary Senex and Sarah Ramsden made use of their contacts at the Royal Society. And the component makers made use of the networks to supply to as many workshops as possible, which in turn enabled the existence and growth of the overall network."},

The act of learning about history and a renewed interest in the English national past was an integral part of this culture, and the narratives espoused in history exhibitions, shows and lectures (on a variety of pasts from Celtic to Tudor or medieval to Stuart) were anchored in discussions about character and patriotism. On the one hand, historians such as David Hume and Henry Hallam offered their scholarly visions of the past, while on the other hand, more commercial exhibits played with these histories as \u2018respectable\u2019 entertainment, at once complementing and challenging more traditional versions. History exhibitions were a central part of the larger market for edification and entertainment, and London had a wealth of potential sites where exhibitors competed to capture the public\u2019s attention from the Strand and Leicester Square to Oxford and Regent Streets (Altick, 1978; Roberts 2017). A city of London\u2019s size proved an ideal site for technological experimentation and exhibition innovation. One such exhibit was Robert Ker Porter\u2019s Agincourt panorama first displayed to the public in 1805 at the Lyceum on the Strand (Curry, 2015, pp 171\u20132).[2] Visitors were invited to stand on a platform and look out at a large-scale image of the medieval battle where Henry V and his army defeated the French. Its presence speaks to a larger revival of interest in medieval battles and heroes underpinned by Anglo-French tensions, yet it used technology, in this case, light and large-scale imagery to make viewers feel as if they were immersed in the battle.\nThe Panstereomachia chimed with these new types of historical experiences.[3] In 1826, Mr Bullock opened his exhibit at 209 Regent Street \u2013 a famous venue for larger scale model works and pictures with a known upper and middle-class clientele. For the price of a shilling, visitors could view a model on a platform, approximately \u201830 foot by 16 or 18\u2019, of the fourteenth-century battle of Poitiers, when the English chivalric hero Edward the Black Prince fought and won a key battle, capturing King John II of France in the first part of the Hundred Years\u2019 War.[4] A key selling point of the exhibition was its mysterious name, which alluded to a new type of experience. Indeed, the name itself was invented by the proprietor and speaks to the ways in which early nineteenth-century exhibitors used \u2018pseudo-scientific\u2019 and \u2018learned\u2019 names to attract customers. The name was translated into Greek in the exhibition guide (Glasse, 1830, pp 155\u20136), [5] although The Times poked fun at it, calling it a picto-mechanical representation and boasting that, like Mr Bullock, it too could also coin a name (1826a; Altick, 1978, p 215).\nThe exhibition reveals the increasing commercialisation of the past and a burgeoning collecting culture. The material used to create the 1,500 \u2018plastic-marble figures\u2019 \u2013 including the Black Prince and King John of France \u2013 was a mystery to viewers, and the model has since been lost. However, it is likely that the use of the term \u2018plastic marble\u2019 (implying a new material) to describe the figures was part of the selling tactic. Colburn\u2019s Magazine was keen to remind visitors that the figures were similar to those sold in the curiosity shops (1827). These exhibitions were commercial enterprises where visitors could buy a special guide available for an additional shilling. Bullock advertised the fact that the models were for sale both individually and in groups for viewers to take home and display.[6]\nThe Panstereomachia offers insight into changing attitudes towards the medieval past. In the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars, exhibitors capitalised on a burgeoning interest in the Middle Ages and promoted the Black Prince\u2019s earlier victories against the French as a source of national pride and celebration. Bullock\u2019s exhibition tapped into an antiquarian interest in medieval arms and armour, a popular enthusiasm for chivalry and romance spurred on by the novels of Walter Scott, and a renewed fascination with \u2018authentic\u2019 medieval \u2018authorities\u2019 such as Jean Froissart (whose Chronicles brought to life the sights and sounds of the fourteenth century, particularly its battles and the exploits of knights). Bullock was keen to promote his figures as both accurate and edifying to attract crowds interested in improvement and novelty. To craft the costumes, weapons and heraldic insignia, he used Samuel Meyrick\u2019s authoritative Critical Inquiry into Antient Armour as well as information from those whose \u2018ancestors had fought in the battle\u2019 (Bullock, 1826, p 5; Meyrick, 1824; Froissart, this edition, 1803\u20131805). Historian Billie Melman showcases a hallmark of these nineteenth century popular exhibitions was their claim to verisimilitude: \u2018to be veritable, history had to be seen as \u201clifelike\u201d, authentic, and first-hand\u2019 (Melman, 2012, p 80). The Panstereomachia, with its use of historical documents and first-hand accounts, exemplifies this premise.\nTo capture the romance and excitement of the day, the exhibitor relied heavily on Froissart\u2019s depiction of events. His model portrayed a key moment near the end of the battle when \u2018friends and foes were\u2026intermixed\u2019 and the French were in retreat towards the city of Poitiers, represented by a painted background (Bullock, 1826, p 44). The exhibition room itself was designed to evoke the age of Edward III; the entrance bore the banners of the English heroes James Audley and John Chandos, and the interior room was painted in a gothic-style architecture with the \u2018armorial bearings of the noblemen and gentlemen who distinguished themselves in the battle\u2019 (Bullock, 1826, p 44). Advertisements and the guide highlighted the Poitiers Panstereomachia as a brilliant \u2018display of British military achievements\u2019.[7] Visitors were encouraged to compare the heroic medieval battle with the \u2018victories\u2026in succeeding ages\u2019 \u2013 recalling their ancestors\u2019 feats during the Napoleonic Wars (Bullock, 1826, p 4).\nNewspapers highlighted the broad appeal of the exhibition from antiquaries to the general public, including the array of \u2018holiday-searchers after strange sights\u2019 (1827). They focused on the model\u2019s effectiveness as an object of edification and entertainment, noting its blend of \u2018\u201ctrue history\u201d and romance\u2019 (1827). [8] In particular, newspapers emphasised how the detailed costumes, the arms and armour of the knights, the models of the soldiers, the weapons that peppered the field, and the topography made the model a useful pedagogical tool (1827).\u00a0 According to the Literary Gazette, Bullock\u2019s arrangement of the figures fostered the feeling of being in the midst of a \u2018mortal combat\u2019 between the French and English,[9] although the critic in The Times found it difficult to imagine why the heroic Black Prince was placed under a tree and not in the centre of the fight (1826a). The Black Prince\u2019s placement illustrates how these popular exhibitions could circumvent expectations. Assessing the value of the model, Colburn\u2019s Magazine suggested that the exhibition would not provide any new details to those knowledgeable of the events, but \u2018to all others (and Mr. Bullock will probably consider these \u201cothers\u201d a most satisfying majority, if he can but secure their visits) it will probably convey a better notion of the event in question than they ever had before; and one that will stay by them longer\u2019 (1827). The exhibition illustrates how Bullock capitalised on the popular taste for medieval victories and novelty to attract visitors to the Panstereomachia, establishing his place in the competitive market of London shows. The Panstereomachia blended technology and history as technology was an integral part in creating the historical experience \u2013 present in its advertising through its invented name, in its mysterious \u2018plastic-marble\u2019 material, and in its final creation of the birds-eye model of the battle."},

It is said by her (sole) biographer, Evelyn Sharp, that Sarah (as she was then known) inherited her mechanical ability from her watchmaker father (Sharp, 1926, 1-2). Ayrton\u2019s father died in 1861 when she was seven years old leaving his family penniless. Her mother returned to her work as a seamstress and taught her family self-sufficiency and generosity, two values Ayrton continued to live by throughout her life.Two years later when Ayrton was nine, she was invited by her maternal aunt Marion Hartog, who ran a school in north-west London with her husband Alphonse Hartog, to live with her cousins and to be educated with them. Despite the personal hardship, Ayrton\u2019s mother Alice recognised her daughter\u2019s immense intellectual abilities and talents and supported the move to London as it provided increased access to education and further opportunities. It was through her cousins that Ayrton was introduced to science and mathematics and by the time she was sixteen, she was living independently and working as a governess.It was around this time that Ayrton became friends with the family of Karl Blind, Jewish-German \u00e9migr\u00e9s, and it was their daughter Ottilie Blind who nicknamed Ayrton \u2018Hertha\u2019 after Algernon Swinburne\u2019s poem of the same name (Mason, 2004). Ottilie Blind and Ayrton became lifelong friends and together they attended suffrage meetings and coached each other for the Cambridge University entrance examination for women in 1874, in part due to the paucity of evening lectures or classes open to women at this time (Sharp, 1926, 26-29). In 1873, Ottilie Blind introduced Ayrton to the woman who would be perhaps Ayrton\u2019s most significant mentor, the outspoken feminist, Barbara Bodichon.Bodichon\u2019s friendship with Ayrton marked a new epoch in Ayrton\u2019s life, providing access to university education and all the related opportunities this entailed. In 1869 and four years prior to meeting Ayrton, Bodichon has been one of the main founders of Girton College, Cambridge. Girton was England's first residential college for women and Cambridge\u2019s sole all-female college. Bodichon encouraged Ayrton to apply to Girton College and also introduced her to the novelist George Eliot (Mary Anne Evans), another feminist and supporter of education for women who personally supported Ayrton\u2019s application to Girton College. Eliot and Ayrton became friends and it is said that the character Mirah in Eliot\u2019s final full novel Daniel Deronda published in 1876 bears a strong resemblance to Ayrton.Ayrton was determined to study at Cambridge University, despite the fact that the university did not award degrees to women. In 1874, Ayrton passed the Cambridge University Examination for women with honours in English and Mathematics, having prepared for the entrance examinations alongside her lifelong friend Ottilie Blind. In 1876, Ayrton sat the Girton scholarship examinations but did not receive either of the two scholarships on offer (Ogilvie, 1990, p 33). Lacking in personal and family wealth, Ayrton would have been unable to afford the \u00a392 a year required to study at Girton without working. Instead she was supported by a loan from fellow suffragette Helen Taylor of \u00a325 per year with Bodichon, George Eliot and Lady Sophia Goldsmid, amongst others, contributing the remaining sum (Crawford, 2000, p 22). In October 1876, Ayrton entered Girton to study mathematics (James, 2010, p 106).[3]\nWhile at Girton, Ayrton was coached (albeit inconsistently) in person and by letter for the Mathematics Tripos by Richard T Glazebrook, one of the most prominent English physicists of his age and an FRS, who she described as \u2018a jewel of a lecturer\u2019 (Sharp, 1926, p 75). In 1880, Glazebrook was appointed a demonstrator at the Cavendish Laboratory when Lord Rayleigh became Cavendish Professor in the same year, switching his attention from mathematics to electrical demonstrations, and he began to tutor Ayrton by letter from then onwards.[4] Around this time, Ayrton also began her earliest work on scientific and medical instruments, designing and constructing a sphygmomanometer, an instrument for recording the pulse in arteries. Ayrton was also an active member of the Girton College community: she was leader of the College Choral Society and founded the college fire brigade (Mason, 1991, p 202; Mason, 2004). Ayrton also formed a mathematics club with fellow mathematician Charlotte Scott, who received special permission in 1880 to become Girton\u2019s first wrangler (a Cambridge undergraduate in mathematics who obtains first-class honours in their third-year exams) but she was left out of the formal Tripos (undergraduate examination) results because of her gender (Jones, 2009, pp 8\u201339).In 1880, Ayrton passed the Mathematical Tripos with only a third-class performance, in part the result of regular bouts of illness. The Mathematical Tripos was the elite degree for English gentlemen for much of the nineteenth century and was considered rigorous and physically demanding. The Mathematical Tripos varied over the nineteenth century but generally consisted of hundreds of testing questions taken in back-to-back examinations. It lasted around a week and such was the rigour that a few students in the nineteenth century died shortly after completing the examinations (Forfar, 1996). As such, it was of special significance for female students and was targeted by campaigners in order to demonstrate women\u2019s intellectual equality with men (Jones, 2009, pp 147\u2013165).However, Ayrton was not granted a certificate or degree. At this time, Cambridge did not give degrees to women and would only award certificates to women in 1881, the year after Ayrton finished at Cambridge (Mason, 1991, p 217). Ayrton successfully completed an external examination and in 1881 she returned to London and received an external BSc degree from the University of London, one of the few British universities who granted degrees to women during this period and which provided a well-worn path for those who graduated from non-degree-awarding institutions at this time. It was upon her return to London that Ayrton began to consider further developing and patenting her first invention, a line-divider, which she began working on while a student at Girton. This would be the beginning of a prolific patenting and inventing career. Over her lifetime, Ayrton was granted twenty-six patents: five on mathematical dividers, thirteen on arc lamps and electrodes, and eight relating to the propulsion of air."},

With an unrivalled collection of historical and cultural material, it is considered to be the most significant group of museums of science and innovation worldwide (Science Museum, 2015). The Group consists of: the Science Museum (London), the Museum of Science and Industry (Manchester), the National Railway Museum (York), the National Media Museum (Bradford) and the National Railway Museum (Shildon). Its collection includes fine art, archival, photographic and library materials as well as thousands of objects both large and small, ranging for example from airframes and locomotives to surgical scalpels and needles. As in many sizable museums, more than ninety per cent of the group\u2019s collection is in storage rather than on display, despite having five public locations and a dynamic loans programme. Not all objects were collected to be displayed but were acquired for reference and research. Some objects remain in storage as they may be too large, too fragile or too hazardous to go on public display but are retained because of their cultural, historic or technical value.\nPreviously, each museum in the group had its own storage facilities both at the museum site and in external warehouses. But to reduce costs to the estate, by 2015 all northern external stores were closed and collections transported to the storage site at Wroughton, Wiltshire. Storage for the Science Museum Library &amp; Archives had already been moved to Wroughton in 2007.\nThe Wroughton store is near Swindon on a former RAF airfield. The 545-acre site, purchased from the Ministry of Defence in 1979 for use as a large objects store, has ten Second World War hangars (with eight being used for collections storage) and one custom-built store (store A1, opened in November 1994). Former maintenance buildings have been converted for use by the Library &amp; Archives, Conservation and Estates operations. At almost 200 metres above sea level the site is exposed to winds from all directions and is susceptible to frequent weather changes. Horizontal rain is a particular feature, resulting in moisture penetration of ageing building fabric.\u00a0The hangars, built in the late 1930s to three different designs all approximately 38,000 cubic metres in capacity, are not heated. All are uninsulated concrete and steel structures.\nThe hangers are in varying degrees of disrepair, some with very limited maintenance over the past 36 years, which has resulted in cracking concrete and rusting steel elements. Three have been renovated, one more fully than the others. However, with the site often being wet and windy, the environment in all the hangars is cold and damp, with temperatures rarely climbing above 13oC, and RH levels between 65\u2013100 per cent, with internal fluctuations mirroring external conditions. Large industrial, agricultural and transport objects are stored either on the floor or on pallets in the hangars. Long-span pallet racking holds smaller or disassembled objects from the engineering technologies, medical, computing, media and science collections; these can be crated, covered with Tyvek or polythene, treated with surface coatings or unprotected, depending on object type and condition.\nStore A1 is an insulated steel framework structure with concrete foundation and felt roof. It was built in 1992\u201393 in response to a strategic review of the Science Museum storage requirements. Designed with environmental controls provided by a building management system, with original specifications for temperature at 14\u00b12oC and relative humidity of 55\u00b15 per cent, the building failed to deliver the tight environmental parameters due mainly to the failure of the dehumidification system. Continuous low level heating by oil-fuelled boilers currently maintains the RH between an acceptable 45\u201365 per cent in the storerooms, but the boilers are ageing and require almost daily maintenance. Storage is on mobile and static racking, leaving no floor space for over-size objects, and there is almost no capacity left for additional objects in the racking. Clearly a new, economically and environmentally sustainable storage solution needed to be found."},

Often, these can be somewhat unwieldy. As Kate Oakley and Sara Selwood note in their recent report on \u2018Leadership of Collaborative Projects between Higher Education and the Arts and Cultural Sector\u2019 for the Leadership Foundation for Higher Education, collaborations between heritage institutions and universities \u2018do not necessarily emerge in a natural, organic way in market economies\u2019. Public funding, they argue, has often had to take a very direct role in creating these working relationships (Oakley and Selwood, 2010). Recent research by Jane Dawson and Abigail Gilmore on North West England has demonstrated the nuances of minor variations within Higher Education and Heritage partnerships. They have contrasted, for example, the organic collaboration that has emerged between the University of Salford and the Salford Museum and Art Gallery (located at the heart of the university campus) \u2018where it would appear to be second nature that they make approaches to each other about joint working on a regular basis\u2019 with the more individual-led approach that led to a funding bid shared by the Bolton Museum and Mark Grimshaw from the University of Bolton, emphasising the importance of \u2018thinking and planning\u2019 that should pre-figure a new venture (Dawson and Gilmore, 2009). Yet in each case the focus has been on the large-scale, often funded partnership which requires significant planning and thinking across institutional hierarchies to realise.\nAnother prime example of this have been the successful and long-running Collaborative Doctoral Partnerships. Funded through the Arts and Humanities Research Council, CDP student awards only emerge after long-term planning and application writing between university academics and curators and other staff at museum and archive consortia. This has produced numerous exciting collaborative projects, fully immersed in the collections and environments of host museums, yet they also represent major investments of time and organisation. Each one can involve up to a year of preparation before the studentship is even taken up, as the funding criteria are highly specific and competition for places intense. A good example of the benefits, but also an exploration of the time pressures and long-term engagement of such collaborative studentships can be found in James Fenner\u2019s account of his research at the Science Museum (Fenner, 2013). With a focus on long-term collaboration and funding bids, it can be very difficult for museums and universities to operate more spontaneously around shared research interests. Yet as Nuala Morse notes in the same edited collection, the work museums undertake with communities already embodies the \u2018improvisation-friendly, participation-centred\u2019 methodologies research collaboration requires (Morse, 2013). The groundwork for more spontaneous partnerships already exists \u2013 it just needs to be capitalised upon.\nIt was the opportunity for a small amount of seed funding that stimulated both authors to initiate this project. Speight, Boddington and Boys have argued that the focus on responding to major funding calls has typically \u2018reinforced rather than challenged\u2019 those partnerships in which shared strategic visions remain limited. The small-scale nature of this project, however, meant that in this instance the authors had an opportunity to work from a very broad foundation of shared research and educational interests, professional convictions and vision for the future of heritage and public history (Morse, 2013). An initial grant of \u00a3500 from the Yorkshire Country House Partnership, generously matched by the University of Sheffield, acted as the stimulus.\nAround \u00a31,000 and ten days, then, to explore something of the relationship between the railways (the NRM interest) and country houses (the YCHP interest).\nIt was the combination of a large, open-ended potential with these limited parameters, as oxymoronic as that may seem, which helped set the actual collaboration (rather than just its preparation) in motion: the forced focus on achieving a number of goals within a short timespan gave the partnership a head-start. Critics may argue, with some justification, that collaborations are at their most fruitful when least constrained. Keri Facer and Kate Pahl have recently staked a claim to the best collaborations as \u2018messy, contingent on practice, uncertain\u2026and lacking distinct anchorage\u2019 (Facer and Pahl, 2017). Yet the freedom to pick and choose an approach within a ring-fence of time and resources to us felt like an asset, at the beginning of a partnership. Although not without its challenges, as will be discussed below, it enabled partners to explore the potential of working together whilst also producing tangible outputs. We always considered this project to be a first step, not a fully-fledged partnership in its own right. For these reasons, we would recommend it as a useful model for fostering partnerships, particularly for precarious and early-career researchers trying to find their feet in both museums and universities.\u00a0"},

Recklinghausen is the northernmost city in the Ruhr area of Germany and the capital of the Recklinghausen district. The southern part of the town was deeply linked to the mining industry, and the substation, on the outskirts of the town, supplied the coal mines and the adjacent residential area with electricity. Today, the substation is a unique combination of a listed heritage site, a technical monument and a working electrical substation, equipped with two modern gas-insulated switchgears.Since December 2000 the site has also been home to the Museum of Electricity and Life[1], an exhibition with about 3,000 square metres of floor space. The Museum takes its visitors on a journey through time, exploring the cultural, social and technical history of electrification. As a source of energy for light, heat and power, electricity found its way into private households in the early twentieth century, although a lot of devices derive from developments in the late nineteenth century. The implementation of more and more devices during the course of the following decades caused fundamental changes in all spheres of life.\nIn order to display these transitions comprehensively, to communicate the past and support understanding, the exhibition concept for the most part avoids presenting widely used everyday objects in showcases without functional context. Instead, the objects are embedded in a designed room with some carefully chosen set dressing to trigger memories and emotions. The four parts of the exhibition portraying domestic life between 1910 and 1980, for example, have painted floors, carpets and tiles typical for the respective period: a precious Persian rug in a living room stands for the wealth of a household of the 1910s; colourful linoleum in a kitchen indicates the new modernity of the late 1950s; and a flokati rug evokes an impression of the 1970s.\nWhere possible original furniture is used to help present the exhibits. Kitchen cabinets coated with pastel resopal \u2013 typical for the late 1950s \u2013 hold all kinds of kitchen appliances. A shelf rack made of dark wood serves as a presentation area for all the electric devices people used to purchase for entertainment or decorating their living rooms in the 1970s. In addition, several original chairs invite visitors to relax, listen to historical radio recordings or watch old TV programmes. The staging \u2013 even where it is lightly indicated \u2013 aims to deliver a historical narrative, providing both interpretation and communication, and hopefully making exhibits meaningful to visitors.\nA special feature of the Museum is that visitors are allowed to touch the exhibits, which enables audiences to engage directly with the objects, reducing reservations about coming into contact with exhibitions in general, and making it easier for them to understand the phenomenon of electricity specifically. Some exhibits will cause surprise, other will invite visitors to stay longer and give an exhibit or an activity a try. Trying something out will always have a more memorable impact than any theoretical attempt at a description of an object.This ability to interact makes the Museum suitable for a wide range of audiences. The visitor profile of the Museum is very diverse: the spectrum extends from the very young to the very old, from the technology-focused to the non-tech-savvy, and from individual visitors to pupils in educational or other groups. But, like every other museum, our objective is to increase the number of visitors, including trying to access new target groups[2] while reaching non-visitors as well. For the Museum of Electricity and Life, non-visitors include low-income families living in our urban district. The Museum is located in a socially deprived area with a high proportion of children living in socially and financially disadvantaged households, for example in single-parent families, larger families, families with unemployed adults and/or families with a migration background. It is well-researched that disadvantaged families participate less in cultural activities. In recent years, numerous studies have addressed the correlation between level of education and cultural participation and provided evidence of the close connection between social background and cultural inclusion.[3]On the one hand these families cannot afford to spend money on entrance fees to theatres, exhibitions and museums, on the other hand they tend to see these activities as uninteresting (Birgit, 2017), and sometimes even as useless and irrelevant because learning or educational offers for children beyond school lessons are not high priorities for these social groups.[4]The Museum\u2019s executives, however, believe that they have not only an educational responsibility, but a social responsibility too. Providing educationally-disadvantaged young people with opportunities to participate in cultural life will help them to develop new competences and enthusiasms that can form a basis for further learning. Within our financial limits and staff capacities we had made many efforts in the past, but had not been able to reach this group. We needed funding to develop a strategic plan and to implement a new approach for a project."},

Engineering also has a women problem (Peters, 2018). Sadly, biases in the real world combine with biases in the online world, and the result is that women engineers are nowhere near as visible online as they should be. This article focuses on the way that women are poorly served, though there are other forms of systemic bias in Wikipedia too that mean that other groups of people are also under-represented.[1]This visibility is a real problem. A 2010 report conducted for the UK Research Councils found that \u2018the internet is central\u2019 to the provision of information about science, engineering and technology (Mendick and Moreau, 2010). Wikipedia ranks as the fifth most viewed website in the world (Gray, 2017), therefore it is central to the provision of information. Because of its widespread use, the way that the history of women in engineering is represented on Wikipedia is relevant to how the field is understood by large numbers of people. This has relevance to the field itself, as well as its perception by a lay public. Choices concerning STEM careers are likely to be influenced by what people see online. A 2018 report by the Women\u2019s Engineering Society details how almost half of young women do not even consider careers in STEM sectors, in part because they believe that STEM careers are \u2018better suited to the opposite sex\u2019 (Peters, 2018). This report links such (mis-)perceptions acquired at an early age with a lack of enthusiasm for pursuing STEM careers. Though students and teachers are aware of potential credibility issues with Wikipedia, evidence indicates that both groups still use it to find information and that teachers even use Wikipedia more often than the average adult user of the internet.[2] Young people and their teachers seeking information on engineering online are likely to have the view that engineering is not a field for women confirmed by what they find on Wikipedia.Research has established that, despite possessing the goal to represent \u2018the sum of all human knowledge\u2019,[3] Wikipedia actually under-represents women.[4] Women are under-represented both in terms of the number of editors actively contributing to Wikipedia, and the number of articles about them (Hill and Shaw, 2013; Khanna, 2012). These two different forms of under-representation have been linked, and some researchers suggest that the emotional labour required of the smaller group of women editors of Wikipedia deters them from editing on topics that they perceive will receive pushback from the majority of (male) editors. Furthermore, in the articles about women that do exist, research indicates that Wikipedia editors are more likely to mention marital status in their metadata, less likely to include language relating to cognition compared with sex and are less central in link networks.[5] Pages about women differ from those about men in terms of quantity and quality.\nThe danger of under-representation of women engineers on Wikipedia is that we often assume that everything to be known is there \u2013 and that if something is not there, this is because the topic, person or place is not important (Paling, 2015; Kennedy, 2017). Omissions of information about the work of women, or women themselves, suggest that women have not contributed. This article analyses some of the pages in Wikipedia to establish how the \u2018gender gap\u2019 affects biographical pages about women engineers on a quantitative level and the \u2018History of women in engineering\u2019 at a qualitative level."},

At this point in time, \u2018electronic music\u2019 was an esoteric affair, which involved recording source material on magnetic tape (real-world sounds in the case of musique concr\u00e8te, electronically-generated signals in the case of elektronische Musik[5]), transforming the sounds through various tape manipulation techniques, and assembling the final composition by cutting and splicing the tape together.[6] Davies\u2019s first practical experience of electronic music came through Daphne Oram (1925\u20132003), composer and former studio manager of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. In 1962, he and a friend produced their first piece of electronic music, Essay for Magnetic Tape, at Oram\u2019s Tower Folly studio. By this time, Davies was a student of Music at Oxford University, where he independently produced several further pieces of electronic music on magnetic tape, as well as setting up a makeshift studio there \u2013 tape-based, of course (Palermo, 2015).Davies was also a keen researcher, documenter and writer, and by the age of twenty had produced a detailed discography for the British Institute of Recorded Sound, a 25,000-word thesis charting developments in electronic music in twenty different countries, and an article in which he evaluated the potential of electronic music as one of a number of emergent techniques and trends in avant-garde music (Mooney, 2015). In 1963, he began a new writing project: a short book about the music of the avant-garde composer Karlheinz Stockhausen (1928\u20132007). Although ultimately never published, it was through researching this book that Davies came to be invited to work as Stockhausen\u2019s personal assistant. He moved to Cologne in 1964 and remained there for the next two years (Mooney, 2016d, p 102)."},

In the interview, you start by saying that the films from the Museum\u2019s collection aren\u2019t themselves modern, but they deal with modern themes. I\u2019m interested in films as objects, their content as objects, and what their content can tell us about attitudes at the time and how we might hold different attitudes now. When you were looking through the films, were you viewing them purely as a visual source, or did you also consider what they meant? What meanings did they reveal to you?\n Bill (BM): Well, to begin with, the educational films we sourced at MSI for this project are still valuable teaching tools. A person with a lay understanding of electricity, such as myself, can still learn things from them that the original makers of the film intended viewers to learn. When I first viewed the films, I was drawn to the use of abstract animation to illustrate how electricity was conveyed. Many of the films depicted electrical current as a stream of charged particles, as represented by white dots on a black background. By using just these animated sequences, the films found a common language when edited together. And the charged particles, representing a subatomic world, seem to represent other currencies in different scales. Suddenly there was a macro aspect to this micro world, where inter-personal, social, and planetary exchanges were operating under the same laws.\n JH: You also say that we\u2019re beholden to electricity and that our relationship with it is one of making it work for us. This is a key strand of the story we will be telling when the exhibition comes to Manchester in October 2018. I wondered what you picked up from the films that led you to think about the human relationship with electricity.\n BM: The films are concerned with demystifying electricity, and showing how it fits in to our households as an essentially nurturing part of our daily life. Electricity lights our homes, and gives us hot water and food. But it also shows how a charge can command the movement, and how a current is formed between oppositely charged poles. The existence of a current, regardless of which direction it is actually running, is more important than any intrinsic value any one of those particles may have. It is its capacity to be moved, and moved in conjunction with other particles, that is its value to the system as a whole.\n JH:\u00a0That\u2019s really interesting. You\u2019re talking about particles existing as a community, the way humans exist as communities. We\u2019re all valuable as individuals, but it\u2019s in the way we combine and separate that we influence the wider world. Would you agree, and do you think, being intrinsically electrical creatures, humans have a different relationship to electricity than they do with other forms of power? Perhaps, as John Gerrard\u2019s piece for the exhibition, X. laevis, explores, the electrical impulses along our nervous system control us and we are therefore more inclined to be controlled by electricity at home, at work and at leisure? I\u2019m thinking about the way there are very few aspects of my life that don\u2019t revolve around electricity, and when the power fails I\u2019m often momentarily nonplussed.\n BM:\u00a0Yes, I agree. In 2012 \u2018Superstorm\u2019 Sandy pushed 4m of seawater into my New York City basement, shorting the entire infrastructure of my building as well as that of the surrounding neighbourhood. I suddenly realised that one of my responsibilities every day had always been to keep my computer and phone charged \u2013 and that I was now suddenly failing at that. Instantly we needed to adapt to our new reality without electricity. A generator was passed around to neighbours to pump our basements out. I carried gasoline in a milk jug on my bicycle to power that generator. We cooked over wood. This went on for six days before power was restored and a huge audible \u2018whoop\u2019 could be heard when the street lights went back on. There was this sense that we had become individual particles again for a moment, unmoored. And now we were once again part of a current, and oblivious to our role in it.\n JH:\u00a0 I really like that image. I hope that it\u2019s something we can get across in the exhibition. The idea that humans are all individual particles forming a current that gets things done and keeps things moving. Thinking about the way the abstract animations in the original films became a sort of language for you in creating\u00a0Electricity, and how they spoke to you about forming communities, not just about visualising electricity, were there other unexpected ways in which the films spoke to you?\n BM:\u00a0Because of the reductive nature of the animations and what they seek to depict, it becomes something of a Creation story, with the particles first descending upon the planet, and then the electricity that forms us eventually enabling us to discover and harness nuclear energy. I found the imagery oddly spiritual in nature.\n JH: And that chimes with the way electricity was originally viewed by people, doesn\u2019t it? Thunderbolts being thrown around by Jupiter in Roman mythology, and the Renaissance fascination with lightning flashes as evidence of divine displeasure. There is something about lightning storms that connects with the essence of our being, that reminds us of how primitive a force electricity is and how primitive we are as creatures, despite our veneer of enlightenment. The films are mostly from the second half of the twentieth century, when science truly began to replace the divine in explaining the world and its workings. Do you think they invite us to position ourselves as the new gods as far as electricity is concerned? Is that another hidden language?\n BM: Yes, that is a subtext in keeping with the optimism of twentieth-century modernism, particularly post Second World War \u2013 that we in fact are the gods. But with that comes an enormous amount of responsibility, so I don\u2019t personally subscribe to that viewpoint. But I do think it is natural that we should power, transport, and communicate electronically. I find the digital revolution to be a wholly organic one, and that this is our language.\n JH: In your film, there are clips that illustrate how electricity is generated at an atomic level, with free electrons passing from atom to atom, creating a flow of electric charge. Thinking about how we\u2019ve worked together on this project, I see you as a free electron and the Museum collection as the conductive material. Having you as the charge has sparked a creative flow through our collection, culminating in your film. I\u2019d like to know how working with the Museum of Science and Industry\u2019s film collection has differed from your usual practice? And how has that affected the final artwork? Did the knowledge that this film would be a focal point of an exhibition about electricity limit your creativity in any way?\n BM: I was lucky that there was a very qualified archivist already installed at MSI, who could direct me to the collection in question. Knowing ahead of time that the exhibit was about electricity certainly did not limit my creativity. I felt like my job was to show how we are intrinsically electrical beings, and therefore everything we do or make is electric, and that electricity is simply the schema of that current.\n JH: When I saw you at the Wellcome Collection preview of the exhibition, with my colleague Alice Cliff who has been working with me on the development of the exhibition content for Manchester, you were delighted that we were each wearing an outfit that incorporated dots. As we\u2019ve already touched on, a lot of the animations that you take from the original films use dots as their visual language. What was their particular appeal to you? Did they come to have a different meaning to their original intent? Were they part of the new language you used in your film?\n BM:\u00a0Well it is always gratifying when your colleagues\u2019 sartorial choices complement the work. I think that was a first for me! But seriously, as I have mentioned, I saw these white dots that appeared in so many of the films in the collection, across several decades, as a type of filmic language, that could be cut together to form a new film. I came to see them not just as an abstraction of subatomic particles, but as individuals, households, populations, currencies, transportation systems and planets. They all represented a charge, their predisposition toward being attracted or repelled by a pole.\n JH:\u00a0There are hundreds of films in the Electricity Council archive at the Museum. We have had 130 of them digitised, and you had access to all the digital copies. You narrowed these down to 25, which made it into your final piece. What was your process for identifying the films that had the most potential for you to work with?\n BM:\u00a0Again, it was the ones that had these animated sequences. I thought they had the most potential of transcending the time and context for which the films were first created and would lend themselves to a more universal, and contemporary, language.\n JH:\u00a0You have made in the region of thirty films so far in your career, many of them collaborations with composers. How do you decide what to make? What inspires you? Who or what are your influences?\n BM:\u00a0The subject of a film can come from any variety of sources. There are film ideas that I have carried around with me for decades, just waiting for the right circumstances to make the film. Sometimes it will be something I read about that I think would make a good film, usually because the content of the film, its meaning, could also be found reflected in its form, that which made the film viewable. I think this is what mostly inspires me \u2013 seeing a film where the form and content merge, and what the film is about is immediately recognisable in the frame. I peruse archives, looking for compelling shots or sequences of this nature. I am not looking for a needle in a haystack as much as I am looking for a needle upon which I can later pile a haystack. I am inspired by the work of my collaborators, but usually not for the idea of what the piece is about as much as how it moves or behaves. I love cutting to music, but usually that music reflects an idea that came from the film.\n JH: Two of your feature length films, Decasia (2002)[2] and Dawson City: Frozen Time (2016)[3], use nitrate film that has deteriorated. What does this deterioration say to you, and what are you trying to communicate to the viewer through its inclusion?\n BM: Decasia and Dawson City: Frozen Time are two very different films, and they actually show two different types of decay. In Decasia, I mostly selected singular scenes showing acute nitrate decomposition to form the basis of the film, and its narrative. With nitrate decay, the image bends and buckles as the nitrate base slowly transforms over time beneath the emulsion. The decay seems to haunt the image like a ghost \u2013 almost like a new character in the film. For me, it is a physical manifestation of the time that has elapsed since the film was first shot. It seems to highlight the physical characteristics of the celluloid itself, and therefore is open to comparisons with the human body, and how it ages, and how that affects the images we carry with us.\nThe Dawson City collection, on the other hand, was fairly well-preserved in its frozen tomb, and ironically does not show that much nitrate decay to the base. What you do see with the Dawson collection is considerable water damage, which it largely suffered once it was exhumed from its burial place. This is seen as the white streaks on the margin of the frame, the distinctive \u2018Dawson Flutter\u2019, as it is known in archival circles, which seems to sit on top of the image like a flickering patina, but does not appear to alter the shape and form of the image as with the nitrate decay. In Dawson City\u2026, I collected my favourite scenes where the characters in a scene seem to be reacting to this water damage, and I edited them together to form the conclusion of the film \u2013 a kind of ode to Decasia. But I did not otherwise fetishize this type of decay elsewhere in the film as I did throughout Decasia, as it appears pretty consistently throughout the collection, and is not really a source of wonder for me in the same way that the nitrate decay is. The historical narrative, and vast trove of footage supporting it, is the true source of wonder for me in Dawson City: Frozen Time. In both cases the physical imperfections are what makes the film contemporary for me. It took them this long to look this way.\n\u00a0 JH: This use of film in its present state interests me as an archivist. So often when displaying archive material, there is an expectation that it will be in pristine condition, or made to become pristine again. For an archivist, this is denying an aspect of the item\u2019s reality and falsifying the evidence that is embodied in its physical being. Is this the same for you as a film maker? Would you say that you are a film maker/archivist?\n BM: Yes, as I said, the physical imperfections are what makes old film contemporary for me. I consider myself more of a film maker than an archivist. If I am an archivist, I am a pretty opportunistic one. Most of what I save is for the express purpose of one day re-purposing it in a film of my own, whether it makes it there or not. Whereas I feel the work of a true archivist is somewhat more altruistic, and scientific in its methodologies.\n JH: As we\u2019ve touched on in relation to Electricity, humanity and community seem to be themes that run through your films. One of my favourites is The Miners Hymns (2011), which combines professional film footage of miners at work with amateur films of miners at play to document the decline of an industry and its community.[4]\u00a0What is it about community that captures your attention as an artist?\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 BM: Well, somewhat ironically I suppose, I work largely alone, except for with a few archivists, musicians and post-production houses. But I see archival film as the greatest physical manifestation of memory, of lives lived. So I feel privileged to be able to address specific eras or events through the films that were shot then and there, and that that specificity of time and place reveals something about the human condition taken as a whole.\n JH: As the archivist who looks after the Museum\u2019s electricity film collection, I gained a different perspective on the films through your interpretation of them. I tend to think of them as functional and educational, whereas you have brought out their hidden beauty. Having seen others of your films, I was surprised by the films you chose to use in Electricity. Was it a conscious decision to steer away from the films in the collection that feature human interaction in domestic settings and focus instead on the technical films?\n BM: Yes, in this case I didn\u2019t want it to be about a household in the 1930s or 40s or 50s, and their unfamiliarity with the devices we now take for granted. I thought I would run the risk of appearing to condescend to an earlier society\u2019s novel experience by doing that. Instead I wanted to find what connected all of us, not just people who lived earlier in the twentieth century, but all humans from the beginning of time, and all animate beings made of star dust.\n JH: What a lovely image to end on. I\u2019d say you\u2019ve done just that, Bill, and it has been an absolute pleasure to work with you on this project.\nThe full list of films used by Bill Morrison in Electricity:\nAlternating Current and Power Factor (1952)British Electrical Development Association presents a Merton Park Production, Frank A Hoare, producer, John Durst, directorAlternating Current and Direct Current (1952)British Electrical Development Association presents a Merton Park Production, Frank A Hoare, producer, John Durst, director\nCapacitors (1952)British Electrical Development Association presents a Merton Park Production, Frank A Hoare, producer, John Durst, directorChemistry for the Nuclear Age (1962)UK Atomic Energy Authority present a Greenpark Production, G Buckland Smith, producer, Frederick Gamage, directorDomestic Hot Water (1951)British Electrical Development Association presents a Merton Park Production, Frank A Hoare, producer, Langston Gould-Marks, directorThe Dounreay Fast Reactor (1960)UK Atomic Energy Authority present an Ace Film Production, Frank Green, producerElectric Water Heating (1957)British Electrical Development Association presents a Merton Park Production, Frank A Hoare, producer, Seafield Head, directorElectricity Distribution (1951)British Electrical Development Association presents a Merton Park Production, Frank A Hoare, producer, John Durst, director\nElectricity &amp; Heat\u00a0(1951)British Electrical Development Association presents a Merton Park Production, Frank A Hoare, producer, John Durst, director\u00a0\nElectricity &amp; Light (1951)British Electrical Development Association presents a Merton Park Production, Frank A Hoare, producer, John Durst, directorElectricity &amp; Movement (1945)British Electrical Development Association presents a Merton Park Production, Frank A Hoare, producer, John Durst, directorGreat Day (1957)UK Atomic Energy Authority present an Ace Film Production, Frank Green, producerMagnetism (1951)British Electrical Development Association presents a Merton Park Production, Frank A Hoare, producer, John Durst, directorMaking Electricity: Sources and Applications of Power (1958)British Electrical Development Association presents a Merton Park Production, Frank A Hoare, producer, David Cons, directorMetals for the Nuclear Age (1958)UK Atomic Energy Authority, Frederick Gamage, directorMirror in the Sky (1956)Mullard Ltd and EFVA present a Realist Film Unit Ltd Production,\u00a0Basil Wright, producer\nPower from the Atom (1982)\u00a0UK Atomic Energy Authority present a United Motion Pictures Production, Alan Ross, director\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nPutting Air to Work (1965)British Electrical Development Association presents a Technical &amp; Scientific Films Ltd production,\u00a0Terrick Fitzhugh, producer, George Sewell, directorPutting the Atom to Work (1966)UK Atomic Energy Authority present a Technical &amp; Scientific Films Ltd productionRadiation\u2026 Naturally (1981)\u00a0Atomic Industrial Forum presents\u00a0The Film Group Inc production\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Simple Electrical Repairs at Home (1947)British Electrical Development Association presents a Merton Park Production, Frank A Hoare, producer, Graham Murray, directorThe Electric Cleaner (1950)British Electrical Development Association presents a Merton Park Production, Frank A Hoare, producer, Langston Gould-Marks, directorTransmission of Electricity (1947)British Electrical Development Association presents a Merton Park Production, Frank A Hoare, producer, Neil Brown, directorWhat Is Electricity?

Lambeth\u2019.Henry Calvert\u2019s 1971 catalogue Scientific Trade Cards in the Science Museum Collection integrates collections largely assembled between the two world wars, by two separate collectors of scientific instruments and related material, Thomas H Court and George H Gabb. Despite the title, Calvert did not produce a comprehensive catalogue of trade cards within the Science Museum collections of early instruments. It does not, for example, record the many that have survived pasted into the fitted boxes in which the instruments were sold. It also includes pieces that are only marginally related to scientific instrument making, and some items that are not trade cards at all.[1] This article has two separate purposes. Firstly it aims to unpack the evidence from a single trade card listed in Calvert\u2019s catalogue. Secondly, in doing so it aims to demonstrate the potential value of careful study of this and similar ephemeral evidence. To locate, digitise, fully catalogue and put online the Science Museum\u2019s rich collection of trade cards would permit intellectual access to a valuable and sometimes unique source for studies of trade and commerce. Interest in and awareness of the ephemeral literature of commerce has long moved on from antiquarian accumulation, as exemplified by Calvert\u2019s basic listing of the Science Museum collection, through analysis of the graphic design by historians of art, to evidence requiring evaluation by historians of material culture.[2] Michael Crawforth demonstrated the usefulness and the pitfalls of using trade cards as evidence in tracing the history of the British scientific instrument trade (Crawforth, 1985). The accepted terminology is, as Maurice Rickards explicitly points out, \u2018ambiguous\u2019. The term embraces a single, usually small sheet of paper sometimes printed in letter press, and supplemented with a woodblock illustration \u2013 or more often the whole printed from an engraved copper plate, which offered greater opportunity for decoration and eye-catching imagery. The trade card recorded a business name, address and products. They were used from the late seventeenth century to serve as a memorandum sheet for a client, or as an invoice, a receipt or a quotation. Only later were they printed on card, and given to potential clients as an aide memoire. Like their paper forebears they could be pasted into boxes to record the seller, if not the actual maker of the associated item. They were also a form of advertising (Rickards, 2000). The Gottlieb piece in the Science Museum collection is certainly advertising. It is also in effect an illustrated catalogue of almost the whole range of products that he designed and could make, or have made, for prospective clients. It is an example of the grey literature which in recent decades has been recognised as a significant resource by archivists and librarians. This paper does not merely use it as an illustration, but uses it, in conjunction with sparse evidence, including newspaper advertising and encyclopedia entries to record the life and times of a hitherto largely unrecognised immigrant who established himself in London, c. 1775, becoming an engineer, designer and assembler of machinery."},

There were objects with surviving information. Just under ten per cent of the collection had a name associated with either its manufacture, sale or use. The names that were inscribed into the spectacle and/or eyeglass frames and cases were one of the first things I recorded as I familiarised myself with the collections. The named groups of people within the collection can be divided into three primary groups: manufacturers\u2019 initials on the silver frames; the name of the suppliers either on the arm of the frame or the front of the case; and a small proportion of users. Information on the frames, including manufacturers initials and supplier information, offered numerous ways for exploring the sites and processes of spectacle manufacture and production. The named information allowed me to explore business records of, for example, Curry and Paxton in London and G.W. Proctor in Sheffield. The materiality of the frame, coupled with textual sources that had been gleaned from named information, allowed questions of skill, division of labour, and historical variation in these areas to be explored. In the study of Curry and Paxton, for example, it became evident that spectacles were produced by piece work and that production continued by hand \u2013 and was highly specialised \u2013 alongside the expansion of factory production. Despite this, case-studying retail is more fruitful in this current study for outlining how material evidence can be used in novel ways because it necessitated drawing upon both the material evidence and a much greater variety of additional sources to obtain any clear trends or findings of significance. In addition, as part of this research, I focused on the names of the suppliers as opposed to the manufacturers\u2019 initials in the first half of the century because of the availability of sources \u2013 the users, for example, had no other traceable information \u2013 and because of the lack of historical work on how and where vision aids were sold between 1800 and 1850.\nExploring the named information on an object is not a novel approach for using objects in history. However, as part of my thesis, I wanted to explore whether I could apply the methods used to study the 88 named objects to the remaining 1000+ objects. Moreover, I chose to research why a large proportion of spectacles and eyeglasses left no written record and what this could say about the nature of vision aid retail. Additionally, my approach was novel for the history of vision testing and vision aids because a broad study of lesser known or unknown individuals had not been previously undertaken. The findings from the material evidence, both named and unnamed, were crucial in revealing the nature and distribution of spectacle and eyeglass retail. By tracing the names of the individuals in a broad range of sources, including trade directories, trade cards and newspaper or periodical advertisements \u2013 and using these sources to explore the retail of vision aids more widely \u2013 I was able to find out two important bits of information: the trade of the seller, and the location where they were sold. Yet the absence of information on the objects also raised a number of questions about the anonymity of vision aid retail, which was confirmed through the study of textual sources. Uncovering the retail information of named and unnamed objects in the collection revealed that spectacles and eyeglasses existed in a number of different locations alongside a number of different objects. Analysing these locations highlighted how using the makers and suppliers \u2013 including those that were anonymous and lesser known \u2013 in a collection can be fruitful for exploring the meaning as well as the retail of an object.\nEighty-eight suppliers were recorded following a search of trade directory records for names that were associated with a spectacle frame or spectacle case within the Science Museum\u2019s two collections. Of these, standalone opticians were the largest number. Figure 1 shows that 33 individuals were described as opticians in their trade directory entries.[10]\nHowever, Figure 1 also shows that there was a significant number of other traders associated with spectacles or spectacle cases and, collectively, these traders outnumbered the standalone opticians in the collection. While there were a few individuals that specialised as \u2018spectacle makers\u2019, the additional trades were predominantly associated with scientific instruments and include philosophical and mathematical instrument making. Additionally, there was also the \u2018optician and goldsmith\u2019 and an even greater proportion of frames and cases that were unmarked and left no trace of where they were sold. The information, or lack of information, on the objects in the Science Museum\u2019s collections proposed that there were three primary locations for the sale of spectacles and eyeglasses: the broader scientific instrument trade, the jewellery trade, and the miscellaneous sundry or street trade that has often been referred to in previous histories.[11] Importantly, vision aids could be stocked alongside a range of other items. Eight suppliers in the Science Museum\u2019s collections, for example, had a number of other instruments associated with their names and this range included: microscopes, hygrometers, kaleidoscopes, telescopes and saccharometers.[12]\nThe trade directory findings also document the location of sale and, specifically, that the spectacle and eyeglass trade existed in both London and the provinces. The location of the instrument trade outside of London has received focused study and a more significant body of instrument makers in the provinces has now been recognised (Morrison-Low, 2007, p 133; Clifton, 1995, pp xii\u2013xiv).\u00a0 However, it has also been noted that objects often create misleading assumptions because a disproportionate number have survived with a London signature (Morrison-Low, 2007, p 285).\u00a0 Similarly, for spectacles and eyeglasses, while provincial examples existed in the collections, the trade directory findings suggest that the overwhelming majority of retailers were situated in London. Indeed, while the objects themselves are a rich source for instrument makers and suppliers, the material evidence suggests that the trade was predominantly London-based. Consequently, objects do allow you to conclude that suppliers existed in both London and the provinces, but reliance on these sources alone is not sufficient. By supporting the objects with a variety of documentary evidence, I was able to develop the suppliers\u2019 names in the trade directory findings further and uncover methods of sale that were not documented in the named supplier information. Combining the study of trade cards, newspapers and periodicals allowed me to explore how retailers marketed spectacles and eyeglasses, what items they were sold alongside, and where they were sold.[13]\nFigure 2[14], for example, illustrates how traders, such as J. Abraham, adopted royal crests, imagery and elaborate backgrounds as tools to bolster their reputation and help position themselves in the wider context of polite commerce (Berry, 2002; Stobart, 2008, p 314).\u00a0 Additionally, the advertisements that mentioned spectacles and eyeglasses between 1800 and 1900 in Gale Cengage\u2019s 19th Century British Library Newspapers and ProQuest\u2019s British Periodicals reveal the benefits and limitations of relying on objects with named information. At first glance, the newspaper advertisement findings reflected the findings from the material evidence: spectacles and eyeglasses were sold in the provinces and in London, as well as among a diverse range of traders. However, the object evidence was not able to fully reveal the diversity of vision aid sale. Spectacles and eyeglasses existed prominently in provincial city and rural locations. Additionally, studying the advertisements of opticians highlighted that opticians with a fixed address travelled outside of their localities to extend the sale of vision aids further. Typically, they arrived in a certain area for a fixed number of days and published in the local newspaper to bring public attention to their presence. Advertisements from Messrs Davis and Sons, based in St James Street in London and 3 Mulberry Street in Liverpool, illustrate the extent to which opticians could travel in this manner. Davis and Sons frequently advertised in a range of locations beyond their shop premises between 1837 and 1840, which included North Wales, the Midlands and the North of England.[15] Advertisements substantiate, and also greatly develop, the conclusions drawn from the objects that retail was both London and provincial.\nStudying additional sources also helps in understanding and explaining the existence of a large number of surviving, utilitarian, spectacles. Trade cards and newspaper or periodical advertisements reveal that there was a great level of diversity of goods for both the standalone \u2018optician\u2019, the \u2018optician and scientific instrument maker\u2019, and the \u2018optician and jeweller\u2019. Within each advertisement, the position of spectacles and eyeglasses could vary from being a small, almost insignificant item, to the primary selling point. Indeed, in the absence of any significant business records, sources such as trade cards, catalogues and advertisements become invaluable for determining the position of an item in the wider trade of a scientific instrument maker (Whipple, 1951; Nall and Taub, 2016, pp 21\u20132).\u00a0 As shown in Figure 2, for example, spectacles were not the visual focus of the advertisement and appear the same size, or do not appear at all, amongst other scientific instruments. However, equally striking was the advertisement of spectacles and eyeglasses amongst sundry good trades for as little as a penny. Besides advertisements, the sale of cheap spectacles appears in fragmentary accounts of street sale in letters of correspondence, reforming publications such as Henry Mayhew\u2019s London Labour and the London Poor, and warnings against spectacle hawkers by \u2018reputable\u2019 retailers.[16] The marginal position of spectacles and eyeglasses amongst certain retailers' stock, and their existence at an extremely low cost, raised a number of questions about how spectacles and eyeglasses were perceived. Indeed, studying the advertisements of spectacles and eyeglasses reveal that vision aids had a threefold function and position: a scientific item that could be sold alongside other instruments, a decorative fancy good that was equivalent to an item of jewellery, and a utilitarian, ubiquitous sundry. While it would be presumptuous to assume that all of the anonymised steel spectacles in the collections were sold as part of the sundry goods trades, the absence of any information surrounding an object is just as telling or interesting as the frames that contained a detailed level of information.\nStudying the names associated with frames or cases in the collections has both its challenges and limitations. Remarkably, the 88 suppliers provide a fairly representative picture of vision aid retail that emerged from a broad comprehensive study of trade cards and advertisements. Collectively, the named suppliers revealed more than the location of sale, they highlighted the different places and contexts that vision aids fitted into in the first half of the nineteenth century. However, the anonymous items in the collection were equally important in this process; they promoted questioning about the place of vision aids amongst a retailer\u2019s stock and the extent to which vision aids were utilitarian items in this period. Additional sources were required in order to answer these questions, but the objects nevertheless were a crucial starting point and are a piece of material evidence that is able to document the fragmentary textual accounts of street and sundry goods sales. There are also limitations when focusing solely on the named suppliers in the collection. One of the problems was the predominance of named information on spectacle cases. The lack of documentation surrounding these objects meant that it was not possible to trace or state with any certainty that it was the original case in which the vision aids were purchased. Consequently, it is only possible to state that the retailer sold vision aids, and it limits the ability of material evidence to be used as a source for exploring the relationship between a particular type of frame and the location of sale. Moreover, relying on the named information alone would have led to fragmentary conclusions about the location of the broader vision aid trade. The named and lack of named information informed and shaped my argument and promoted questioning about the sale and meaning of these objects. While the named information is useful, it does not necessarily bring out the full potential, or strength, of objects and collections as a historical source."},

Interventions in \u201cUnloved\u201d Museum Collections\u2019 conference held in 2015 at the Dana Research Centre, Science Museum (London). The conference marked the culmination of a UK Arts and Humanities Research Council funded project of the same name. Like the project and conference, this new book shines a light on \u2018unloved\u2019 museum collections. A term, the editors explain, which refers to stored collections, and more broadly objects with limited public appeal and for which \u2018significance may be harder to recognize\u2019 (p 1). Yet to speak of \u2018unloved\u2019 collections is not to suggest that they are disregarded. On the contrary, this book takes the reader beyond public displays into the hidden space of museum storerooms to look at who cares for such collections, and in doing so reveals a range of individuals, groups and institutions who care intensely. Driven by the applied aim of considering what happens \u2018when people who care about stored collections are brought into the research, engagement, and curatorial process\u2019 (p 7), the book addresses a broader challenge for the museum sector: how to find new ways to understand, interpret and use \u2018unloved\u2019 collections in ways that will enable the public \u2018to value them as much as, if not more than, objects which are \u201ceasy to love\u201d\u2019 (p 201).\u00a0This book is a welcome addition to material culture and museum/heritage studies. Beyond a few notable exceptions (Brusius and Singh, 2017; Macdonald, Morgan, Fredheim, 2020), these fields have largely overlooked stored collections, despite the fact that these form the vast bulk of museum holdings. Additionally, the kinds of \u2018uncharismatic\u2019 (p 2) objects featured across the book\u2019s three sections and eight chapters have also been ignored within critical scholarship. In their introduction, the editors do a fine job of outlining the book\u2019s structure and intended contribution to wider debate. A tightly articulated set of guiding questions (around care, emotion and collections) tie the various threads together. By focusing on the emotional response and caring practices of museum professionals and external stakeholders working with stored collections (and especially with objects considered by others to be \u2018dull\u2019 or \u2018uninteresting\u2019), a range of sub-themes are addressed including curatorial practice, expertise, knowledge, ownership and value.\nSection One draws on the work of the original \u2018Who Cares?\u2019 project to provide a fascinating look into how \u2018unloved\u2019 collections are understood, accessed and interpreted by enthusiasts, or non-professional experts. We meet the Lock Collectors Association encountering the lock and fastening collection at the Science Museum, London (Chapter One, Hess); past donors, collectors and users of the Museum of English Rural Life\u2019s historic hand tools collection (Chapter Two, Smith); and the Historical Metallurgy Society who co-manage the national slag collection owned by the Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust (Chapter Three, Woodham and Kelleher). Collectively, these chapters explore the \u2018emotional, biographical, and professional ties that connect people to \u201cunloved\u201d objects\u2019 (p 14). By considering how and why enthusiasts care for collections, the role of lived experience of objects, skills-based understanding, and physical engagement with material and sensory qualities of objects in generating emotional response, personal meaning and collections knowledge is highlighted. Overall, this section raises the question \u2013 as Woodham and Kelleher (Chapter Three) explicitly consider \u2013 if such enthusiasms \u2018can be transferred or shared between those who \u201ccare\u201d and those who seemingly do not\u2019 (p 14).Section Two further responds to this question. It invites museum professionals to reflect on their work with \u2018unloved\u2019 collections and strategies for giving stored objects a new lease of life. Artistic \u2018rummaging\u2019 through museum storage to generate imaginative response (Chapter Four, Woodall); social media campaigns using humour and emotional connection for public engagement with natural history specimens and models (Chapter Five, Carnall); and \u2018expert volunteer\u2019 interpretation of \u2018mundane and impersonal\u2019 medical instrument handling collections (Chapter Six, MacLeod) provide examples of initiatives that have revived the image, status and use of stored collections. These chapters direct our attention to the power of collaborative and creative practice, and the possibilities of using more informal modes of engagement (e.g. play, humour, imagination, experimentation, personal response, intergenerational conversation, sensory hands-on encounter), for collections (re)interpretation and access.Section Three continues this self-reflexive approach; here through chapters written by academics reflecting on the role of emotion and care in their own research with museum collections. By examining personal response to \u2018lost objects\u2019, or those items for which little historic contextual information is known (Chapter Seven, Watson), or emotional reaction to archival materials encountered through collections research (Chapter Eight, Church), this short section opens a much bigger discussion. It prompts us to consider how museum professionals working with \u2018unloved\u2019 collections might similarly recognise \u2013 and productively harness (e.g. for collections research and access) \u2013 their own emotional responses to such objects (p 15).Overall, the book encourages reflection on how different forms of expertise might be better acknowledged and integrated into mainstream curatorial practice and public engagement to address the challenge of reviving the interpretive, research and/or display potential of stored collections. However, chapters also demonstrate complexities of reconciling knowledge practices that, while holding powerful potential to reconnect collections with their \u2018social and emotional lives, biographies and agency\u2019 (p 103), may significantly differ. Hess\u2019 account (Chapter One) of lock collectors, for whom accessing the meaning of objects \u2018is often about touch and taking things apart\u2019 (p 28), vividly illustrates the differences between enthusiasts and professional conservation and collections management understandings of care. Moreover, while the book offers commentary on successful examples of institutions caring for \u2018unloved\u2019 collections \u2018in a shared and distributed way\u2019 (p 76) (see, especially, Woodham and Kelleher\u2019s discussion of a co-managed collection), critical questions regarding non-professional agency in collections care are also raised. This is a topical theme in museum/heritage studies where scholars have queried how (and if?) efforts to increase public participation in heritage can \u2018avoid exploiting volunteers or devaluing professionals\u2019, and what needs to occur to avoid \u2018changeless change\u2019, or the reinforcement rather than renegotiation of existing power structures (Fredheim, 2018). This book connects, implicitly, with these kinds of broader debates by arguing that caring for collections is as much about caring for people and relationships as it is objects.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Another theme underpinning the book is value. To describe a collection as \u2018loved\u2019 or \u2018unloved\u2019 is to evaluate its perceived wider relevance, interest and significance. Yet by delving into the \u2018cultural ecologies\u2019 (p 198) of collections care, the book reveals how there is nothing inherently \u2018unlovable\u2019 about collections of slag, locks and fastenings, microscope slide specimens, agricultural tools or medical instruments. Whether these items are loved is neither given, nor intrinsic to the qualities of objects (e.g. subject matter, visual appearance), but emerges from \u2018shifts in taste and fashion, changing research cultures, changing notions of aesthetics, or certain politics which might marginalize specific objects and spaces\u2019 (p 197). Moreover, as the book\u2019s chapters vividly illustrate, the different degrees of visibility accorded to a collection (i.e. if things are put on display, or into storage on- or off-site), and specific practices of care (including research, access and preservation activities) also attribute value. As the editors summarise, \u2018if collections are placed in storerooms which cannot be readily accessed or viewed, then we are never giving those who don\u2019t care an opportunity to love these objects\u2019 (p 198). While claims about the emergent nature of value are well-established within the wider scholarly field (Jones, 2017), a nuanced insight offered by this book is the observation that collections do not easily fit into straightforward binaries of being \u2018loved\u2019 or \u2018unloved\u2019. These are tantalising prompts, yet remain somewhat implicit with scope for further conceptual work to engage more directly with value debates, as the editors acknowledge (p 197). Certainly, while there is real \u2018hands-on\u2019 insight in this book for museum professionals wanting to \u2018put a little love\u2019 in their stored collections (p 197), one of its main contributions is in establishing a research agenda. In the final pages, the editors note several areas ripe for further exploration, including further work on how to conduct emotional (collections) research (p 202). By arguing for material culture and museum/heritage studies to pay much greater theoretical and empirical attention to stored collections (in ways that go beyond understanding these simply through the lens of collections management issues), the book ultimately demonstrates how \u2018unloved\u2019 collections provide a rich nexus for wider debate on themes such as expertise and public agency, the politics of participatory heritage, concepts of care and affective, emotional modes of heritage engagement. In sum, this is a nicely written and illustrated book which offers a stimulating and original take on museum collections. One can imagine a wider readership to include museum/heritage studies scholars interested in collections, professional stewards who are trying to enhance (or simply identify!) the societal relevance of stored museum collections, and a general readership tantalised by the behind-the-scenes glimpse into museum storerooms."},

It is useful in this context for the ways in which it helps explain the construction of what has been termed a \u2018physical storyline\u2019 (Pitches, 2011, p 141) depicting, in this case, how nineteenth-century lecture demonstration practices have been transmitted through the twentieth and on to the twenty-first centuries. In Performer Training: Developments Across Cultures Ian Watson elaborates on his adoption of the term \u2018vertical transmission\u2019 (Watson, 2001, p 3), describing the practice of performance skill and embodied knowledge being handed down from one generation to the next as being part of a broader tradition that he classifies as \u2018direct training\u2019 (Watson, 2001, p 2).[2] Watson\u2019s examples include traditional East Asian forms such as Japanese Noh theatre, the Indian dance-drama Kathakali, and Balinese dance, where the focus is on specific skills being taught by masters to apprentices, the aim being to transmit a precise codified language relating to an established repertoire, with little deviation from the master\u2019s performance. He offers perhaps the most fundamental example of vertical transmission in Japanese Kabuki theatre, where on retirement a great actor passes on to one specially chosen pupil not only his skills and embodied knowledge, but also his actual name (Watson, 2001, p 3). Richard Schechner (1985) also turns to early East Asian forms in his discussion of the embodied ways in which performance traditions are first embedded and then passed on in different cultures. He goes significantly further in historical terms to suggest that such practices are likely to have been established in \u2018what might have been the world\u2019s earliest theater, the events occurring within the paleolithic caves of southwest Europe\u2019 (Schechner, 1985, p 22) some twenty-five thousand years ago. Schechner notes a similar pattern in theatre training: \u2018Theater people know about training; it is expected that teachers of theater be able also to practice it\u2019 (Schechner, 1985, p 25). In these models the passing on of skills is deliberately structured around the notion of \u2018imitation\u2019, critical to theories of vertical transmission, and there is usually an explicit sense of a \u2018master-disciple\u2019 relationship (Schechner, 1985, p 23). In the \u2018V\u2019 section of A Lexicon of Training Terms, Brayshaw et al also define the term:\nVerticality is the embodied transmission of training knowledge and skill from one generation to the next, usually in a specific training context which allows for a deep and long-lived relationship between the trainer and trainee. Because of its association with generational transmission, verticality is often referred to as occurring within a training \u2018family\u2019 \u2013 from surrogate father to son but much less often from surrogate mother to daughter.\n(Brayshaw et al, 2012, p 397)\nAs with Watson\u2019s and Schechner\u2019s interpretations verticality in this definition is primarily concerned with the notion of repetition and replication, rather than a practice that reinterprets and rediscovers. But noteworthy, here, is the suggestion that the vertical relationship privileges the passing on of embodied skills from \u2018surrogate father to son\u2019. This is in contrast to the etymological root of vertical transmission from medical science, which denotes a mother-child descent:\nVertical transmission: Passage of a disease-causing agent (pathogen) from mother to baby during the period immediately before and after birth.\n(WebMD, 2015)\nThe western adoption and re-positioning of the term in a performer-training context to describe a male-oriented hierarchical relationship reveals much about the patriarchal domination of the field and it is only in the latter part of the twentieth century that women have been seen to play a credible role in western performer training practices.[3] In the parallel domain of the RI, practitioners during the nineteenth century were exclusively male. Indeed, with only a minority of exceptions, this prevalence has persisted, and similarly, it was not until the 1990s that women began to be regular practitioners of lecture-demonstration practices.[4]"},

Today women play a more active role in the running of the railway but for many the railway in the past was filled with men, and it was perceived at the time as an environment where women did not belong. In many ways this misconception is understandable, and surviving photographs reinforce the idea.\nHowever, these images only tell one side of the story. Many people are unaware that women worked on the railways as early as 1850. In the 1851 census, for example, there are fifty railwaywomen cited, and by 1901 this had grown to 1,633 railwaywomen (Wojtczak, 2005:5). About a third of these women would have worked in the hotel industry as cooks, chambermaids, kitchen assistants, cleaners, laundresses and waitresses, with the highest grades in this area being housekeeper and tea room manageress. It seems surprising nowadays that a woman could be described as a \u2018railwaywoman\u2019 while working in the hotel industry, but it is important to note that at this time the railway owned a great deal of infrastructure and real-estate including hotels and taverns that people frequented on their journeys. Many railways also owned docks (for example, London and South Western Railway owned Southampton Docks), and even steam ships: the steam ships travelling to Jersey and Guernsey from Southampton Docks were owned by London and South Western Railway. The hotel industry was not the only work available to women on the railway in 1901 but it is certainly true that other roles available were very limited. The highest rank a woman could achieve on the railways themselves was that of an Inspectress. This job consisted of checking that ladies\u2019 accommodation was up to standard and involved managing female staff (women never managed men on the railway). Women could also be crossing keepers. This job was usually offered to a disabled railwayman, since it was light work that could easily be performed by a person with limited mobility and strength and it could be offered to a woman on a man\u2019s refusal or absence. This job was sought after as it came with a house, and in many cases it ended up being passed between female family members. These crossings were small with little traffic and so were deemed easy enough for women to manage. Those women who took up the position were paid a lower rate of pay compared to male crossing keepers and were expected to work the same hours; however, many women enjoyed the job as it allowed them the flexibility to raise a family while working. Another job available to women was carriage cleaning. Again, this was offered with some restrictions, with women only allowed to clean carriages in the station as the yard was considered the domain of men.\nWomen were employed as early as 1840 in the railway workshops such as Nine Elms in London, but there were still restrictions for women. In the railway workshops women were employed in what might be considered typically female roles: upholstering, painting, cleaning and catering, to name a few (see Figure 4). London and South Western Railway employed women actively and had a policy of hiring women who were widowed by accidents on the railway. They were always in female roles but the work did enable them to support themselves and their dependents. This is a very different view of the railway from the male-centred and harsh world that has been portrayed in books such as Bonavia\u2019s The History of the Southern Railway (1987)."},

The gallery, designed by Zaha Hadid Architects, will cover a period of four hundred years, drawing on the Science Museum\u2019s historic collection. Following the principle that mathematical practice has underpinned and been driven by some of our most fundamental human concerns, the gallery aims to inspire and broaden the understanding of what mathematics can be, introducing the people, past and present, who have worked in or with the subject (Rooney et al, 2012). In March 2015 the Science Museum acquired a machine for modelling storm surges into its Oceanography collection (see Figure 2). This new acquisition is a key object for the new mathematics gallery as it encompasses multiple stories that demonstrate the far-reaching impact and relevance of mathematical work.\nThe storm surge machine sits within the Maps &amp; Models section of the new gallery. This section presents examples of the use of mathematics to understand and control the environment, with stories that cover the survey of the land and mapping of the stars. Following this theme, the new acquisition is concerned with modelling the oceans and was developed to combat the threat of storm surges. Storm surges are oceanographic events created by strong winds pushing water against a coastline in excess of normal levels (Parker, 2010, p 69). On the evening of the 31 January 1953 a storm surge developed in the North Sea. A period of low atmospheric pressure, with gusts of wind of up to 203 km/h (126 mph), combined with a high spring tide causing the sea level to raise five metres above its usual height (Met Office, 2013). As the storm progressed, the sea level and swell was pushed southwards towards the east coast of England and the Northern European mainland with vast waves hitting East Anglia, the Netherlands, and Belgium.\nThe impact was devastating. The large-scale flooding killed over two thousand people, including 326 in the UK (Met Office, 2013). Ice-cold seawater destroyed thousands of homes, farmland and livestock (see Figures 3 &amp; 4). Over thirty-two thousand people were evacuated from their homes and over fifty million pounds was incurred in reparations (Met Office, 2013).[1] The main problem identified was the lack of warning given to the areas affected. At the time of the flood the study of storm surges was underdeveloped, with oceanographic research focusing on tidal prediction. There was limited data on mean sea level in the North Sea basin due to the lack of a coordinated approach to storm surge prediction which often made warning triggers unreliable (Boon, 2004, p 147). In addition, there had been no effective system to signal impending impact along the coast of the UK and the message was slow to travel across the British Isles, exacerbated by the fact that the storm hit at night on the weekend (Baxter, 2015, p 1295). Furthermore, there were inadequate preventive barriers in place along vulnerable areas of the British coastline, in many cases as a consequence of wartime breaches (Baxter, 2015, p 1307). The 1953 North Sea flood is considered to be the worst natural disaster in British history (Parker, 2010, p 82\u201383). The damage prompted a governmental review into flood risk, establishing the Department Committee on Coastal Flooding (known as the Waverley Committee) in order to develop a research plan to prevent future disasters (Parker, 2010, p 82\u201383). In 1954 the Storm Tide Warning System and Tidal Gauge Network were established, a first step toward creating a warning system to track changes in mean sea level across the British coastline (Smith and Ward, 1998, p 285). This network also provided a way to collect regular, uniform data from which long-term predictions could be developed.\nThe National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) in Wormley, now the National Oceanography Centre (NOC)[2], had been created in 1949 to bring together mathematicians, oceanographers, physicists and engineers for a wide range of oceanographic work (see Figure 5) (Laughton, 2010, p 78). The organisation grew out of Second World War research, where careful calculation of tidal movements was vital for naval operations. George Deacon, the first Director of the NIO, and his team contributed to the success of the D-Day landings and developed systems that aided deep ocean navigation (Laughton, 2010). After the 1953 floods the government promptly increased support for storm surge research at the NIO, backing a shift away from tide prediction and toward forecasting oceanographic events, with an emphasis on an integrated approach, incorporating physical modelling and mathematical computation (Carlsson-Hyslop, 2010, p 277).[3]Following the new government directive, the NIO began to look overseas for new insights in storm surge modelling. In 1956 Deacon travelled to Japan to attend a conference on tsunami modelling, where he encountered Shizuo Ishiguro presenting a paper on his electronic analogue system for measuring the coastal impact of surges (see Figure 6) (Cartwright, 2011).\nIshiguro was a trained electrical engineer and meteorologist and had begun developing a system for storm surge prediction during his time working at the Marine Observatory in Nagasaki. There he was tasked with the development of a system that could aid the fishing industry through the prediction of ocean events (Erosion Board Office, 1953). In 1957, following their initial introduction, Ishiguro took up a UNESCO fellowship to work with Deacon at the NIO in order to develop his work further (Cartwright, 2011).[4] In 1959, after working in the UK for two years, Ishiguro joined the NIO on a permanent basis as an oceanography engineer (Cartwright, 1999, p 183).[5] In this role he was able to develop his machine for modelling storm surges with application to the North Sea basin. Ishiguro\u2019s machine converted hydrographic and meteorological data into electronic quantities, such as voltage and current, in order to model storm surges and other long-wave phenomena.\nUsing knowledge of the area under investigation, the machine simulated how a surge might behave and consequently its effects on a coastline and surrounding area. It produced output data as real-time electronic quantities through an oscilloscope or as photographic records of wave responses. Ishiguro built the machine in order to work out when surges will occur, where they will make coastal impact, how high the surges will be at different locations, and why they occur from an \u2018academic point of view\u2019 (Ishiguro, 1968). Although developed in response to a specific natural disaster in British history, Ishiguro\u2019s machine is part of continuing mathematical and engineering attempts to provide accurate surge and tidal prediction. Mathematics has been used to understand the oceans since antiquity but it was in the eighteenth century that hydrodynamics \u2013 the study of the movement of fluids \u2013 was formally developed with the application of calculus (Darrigol, 2005, pp 3\u20135). In the nineteenth century further progress was made with harmonic analysis, Lord Kelvin\u2019s (William Thomson) mathematical technique to measure waves and currents (Parker, 2010, p 34\u201339). Kelvin realised that tides could be broken down into waves of distinct oscillation, extracted from observations as tidal constituents (Boon, 2004, p 46). Harmonic analysis enabled estimates to be made regarding amplitude and phase for a set of tidal constituents at specific locations of coastline, forming a prediction of the tidal movements (Boon, 2004, p 93). The Science Museum collection holds Lord Kelvin\u2019s tide-predicting machine from 1876 (see Figure 8), which was able to calculate a year\u2019s worth of tidal movements using the harmonic method of analysis, as well as Kelvin\u2019s harmonic analyser for tidal computations from 1878 (INV. 1896-60) which solved partial differential equations to inform hydrodynamic research. Alongside their calculation ability, these machines relied on the collection of accurate data through tidal staffs and weather gauges (Parker, 2010, p 35).\nIshiguro\u2019s machine continues this tradition of mechanical analysis of the oceans but with specific application to storm surges, a more complex oceanographic event due to its incorporation of meteorological elements as well as hydrographic variables. The strength of a surge impact is influenced by many elements including the shape of a sea basin, wind strength, the coastal topography and the bathymetry (sea floor topography and depth) of the affected area (Smith and Ward, 1998, p 152). As such storm surge models need to allow for altering water depths and changing boundary conditions in order to meaningfully recreate the movement of a storm through an area of water. As a result of this need to incorporate flexibility and movement within a set period of observation, storm surge modelling lends itself more readily to physical modelling (Smith and Ward, 1998, p 284). At the time of the machine\u2019s inception, in the 1950s, electronic computing became a popular tool for this type of modelling due to the ability to calculate complex differential equations at high speed, whilst also incorporating changing parameters and presenting results in real-time (Bissell and Dillon, 2012, p 108). To perform a simulation using the machine, parameters are set that conform to the body of water and conditions under investigation \u2013 in this case the North Sea. The shape of the North Sea basin makes it particularly vulnerable to storm surges due to the funnel-like movement of water toward the Northern European coast, making the accurate inclusion of its physical conditions important for effective modelling of events. Throughout the machine\u2019s life-span, Ishiguro\u2019s research benefitted from increased accuracy of this data via technological improvements in data collection, with ship borne wave recorders put into action from 1974 onwards and precision depth recorders and sonar technologies gathering more accurate bathymetry measurements in the second half of the twentieth century (Walker, 2012, p 324). The machine can incorporate conditions for water depth, wind level, Coriolis effect (force relating to the Earth\u2019s rotation), and atmospheric pressure over a specific period of time through voltage generators (Ishiguro, 1968). Furthermore, inertia and bottom friction can be represented by inductors and resistors (Ishiguro, 1968).\nThe main mesh framework is a large grid of wires that represent finite-difference models. Grids like Ishiguro\u2019s are used as the basis of most modern computer-based storm surge modelling, allowing oceanographers to control calculations in distinct sections of a body of water, with the grid-like structure helping formalise the otherwise amorphous variables under examination (see Figures 9 &amp; 10). In Ishiguro\u2019s machine hydrodynamic equations are applied to each mesh, which are then solved simultaneously within a specified time framework in order to create differential equations within appropriate conditions (Ishiguro, 1968). Once the parameters have been set, electrical waves are run through the mesh of wiring that can be altered to represent different strengths of surge and different wave formations (see Figure 11). The results can be recorded by oscilloscope or photographic imprint along with the difference number from the mesh to provide wave responses of the modelled event.\nThis method allowed Ishiguro to track the hydrographic movement, as electronic quantities, across small sections of water in order to build a simulated model of a surge in its entirety. As a consequence, he was able to make predictions about which areas of coastline along the North Sea basin would incur a violent impact in the event of a storm surge, or whether the surge would avoid the coastline altogether. Subsequently areas could be highlighted as particularly vulnerable in order to recommend increased flood barriers or locations recommended for the installation of tidal gauges for improved sea level measurement. Ishiguro\u2019s research also had implications on construction in the North Sea. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s much of the NIO\u2019s work was directly funded by the oil company Exxon (Woodworth, 2012). Drilling for oil and gas began in 1964 and, alongside the Meteorological Office, the National Institute\u2019s work was employed in order to provide accurate forecast conditions for the installation and maintenance of rigs in the North Sea (Walker, 2012, p 371).\u00a0\nIshiguro proposed that his electronic machine had advantages over contemporary digital machines as it offered continuous variation of current in contrast to the finite increments of digital machines of the period (Ishiguro, 1968) (see Figure 12). Its use of electronics offered an approach to the physical modelling of water that answered problems not met by digital equivalents of the time and allowed for more flexibility when simulating due to its ability to be tweaked by the researchers in real time. However, while considered to have been an innovative development in oceanographic instrumentation and analysis, the machine\u2019s construction came at a time when computer models were fast developing and during its development it was eclipsed by digital flexibility beyond the capacity of Ishiguro\u2019s machine (Laughton, 2010, p 176). However, it remains a key example of electronics and analogue modelling techniques in this field, representing both a specific period of oceanographic research (1950s and 1960s) and an alternative method to the digital models in their infancy. Following the technological changes across the NIO, Ishiguro\u2019s machine was thought to have been destroyed, with no trace remaining bar a film in the NOC archive (Woodworth, 2015).[6] In fact, the machine was still intact in the Ishiguro family home, in the small shed where Shizuo had continued to work on it. The machine was developed continuously over a period of around fifty years, at the NIO between 1960 and 1983, and later outside of the organisation through Ishiguro\u2019s continued work on the machine at home up until his death in 2007.[7] The Science Museum has acquired the machine in its final formation, comprised of two main units; one holds the input and output devices (wave-form generator, Commodore CBM 8032 Computer and Commodore 2031 5\u00bc\" floppy disk drive, OS-240 oscilloscope) and the other comprised of the mesh grid through which the electricity ran, and the photographic recording components of the device are housed.[8]Alongside Ishiguro\u2019s machine, Mathematics: The Winton Gallery will present modern forms of oceanographic modelling and data collection techniques used at the NOC and other oceanographic industries today. Institutions like H R Wallingford, Europe\u2019s largest independent research consultancy, continue the tradition of physical modelling in combination with computer systems and theoretical mathematics in their large-scale models of coastal structures. The NOC now relies heavily on mathematical software, using programmes like Python or CS3x to model sea level and surges, whilst continuing to rely on the measurements from tidal gauges but with the application of technologies like radar to collect more precise data (see Figures 10 &amp; 13).\nThe NOC is currently owned by the National Environment Research Council with much of its funding coming from the Environment Agency, representing a shift in recent years to concerns about global warming and climate change. Alongside preventive forecasting, their work now informs the installation of wind farms. Mathematically their models and simulations are ever more complex as a result of the deeper understanding of weather systems and larger collection of data. Newer mathematical techniques are now used, such as ensemble forecasting which builds on multiple simulations of an ocean event in order to develop a probability for a forecast\u2019s reliability rather than to define a singular model from which to forecast the outcome of a surge. Future storm surge models will continue to develop finer meshes of computation and better bathymetric modelling, along with the ability to input real-time data from sophisticated gauge technology (Smith and Ward, p 286). Ishiguro\u2019s machine and these current oceanographic models are mathematical attempts to understand and control natural phenomena. The storm surge modelling machine, while the work of an oceanographer and engineer, relies on mathematics at its heart. It is mathematics in relation to fundamental human concerns, developed in response to real world problems that affect cultures across the globe. The devastating floods of 1953 were a historically significant event in British history, as was the development of the North Sea oil industry. From a technical standpoint, this machine represents a unique example of electronic analogue computation for hydrography and storm surge analysis, before the development of complex computer modelling took hold in oceanographic research (Cartwright, 2011). Through the application to physical elements the machine offers an intriguing and visually stimulating way to introduce complex mathematics. By attaching the subject to objects, people, technology and events, as we have in the case of the storm surge modelling machine, we hope that Mathematics: The Winton Gallery will show mathematics to be both inspiring and relevant.\n\u00a0\nAcknowledgments\nWith thanks to the Ishiguro family for their generosity in donating the machine to the Science Museum, and in particular to Fumiko for answering my requests for information about her father\u2019s work.

Since a museum\u2019s practice is usually defined by the institution\u2019s mission statement \u2013 which in turn typically defines the institution\u2019s subject matter by highlighting audience needs (Gurian, 2005, p 54) \u2013 it is my belief that, by exhibiting sounds that museums themselves have collected, museums might be able to both engage audiences on another sensory level (thereby experimenting with the latest trends in museological theory) and better fulfil their missions of educating the public, by exposing them to the increasingly scrutinised culture of sound. This belief, while becoming increasingly popular among museum practitioners, is simultaneously a radical break from tradition and a return to the discipline\u2019s very roots.The concept of the museum \u2013 institutions dedicated to collecting, preserving, and displaying the objects of culture \u2013 can be dated back to the ancient world, when large-scale research institutions such as the museum within the Library of Alexandria functioned as integral parts of dedicated learning complexes. However, museums of this time tended to focus their research activities on literature more than objects, as one noted satirist of the time, Timon of Philus, once declared, \u2018In populous Egypt many cloistered bookworms are fed, arguing endlessly in the chicken coop of the Muses\u2019 (Barnes, 2004, p 62). The contemporary notion of what we now refer to as museums dates back to at least Quiccheberg\u2019s sixteenth-century treatise on Wunderkammers and Kunstkammers, the first published attempt at defining a methodology by which museums should be organised, which acted primarily as a guide for organising the collections of elite noblemen (Quiccheberg, 2013, p 3). These privately owned collections eventually evolved into significantly larger public institutions dedicated to enriching the knowledge of (supposedly) people of all classes, commencing with the seventeenth-century opening of the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford (Abt, 2006, p 115). The opening of the British Museum and the Louvre in the eighteenth century ushered in the age of the so-called \u2018universal museums\u2019 \u2013 institutions that aspire to make a \u2018universal\u2019 survey of culture (Duncan and Wallach, 2012, p 50; Sloan and Burnett, 2004), attempting the impossible mission of following Quiccheberg\u2019s treatise by assembling massive collections that are intended to categorise and display all of human knowledge (Curtis, 2012, p 74). It is significant to note that the Wunderkammers and cabinets of curiosities of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries incorporated a multisensorial approach to the interpretation of the objects in the collections (Edwards et al, 2006, p 18). These early museums aligned themselves with contemporary thinkers such as the seventeenth century scientist Robert Hooke, who suggested that proper investigation of an object included determining its:\nSonorousness or Dulness. Smell or Taste\u2026Gravity, or Levity. Coarseness, or Fineness. Fastness, or Looseness. Stiffness, or Pliableness. Roughness, or Brittleness. Calmness, or Slipperiness. (Howes and Classen, 2013, p 18)\nEarly museumgoers \u2013 chiefly made up of princes and other nobles \u2013 were subsequently allowed by Wunderkammer curators to engage with displayed objects in multisensory ways, actively partaking in not only the sights of the objects, but their smells, touch, and sounds as well (Howes and Classen, 2013, p 18).Museum attitudes towards the multisensory began to change as they opened for public access in the nineteenth century. A gradual shift occurred within museum practice towards a particularly western, colonial, and ultimately modern visual approach to the transmission of knowledge (Edwards et al, 2006, p 18), depriving the public of the Wunderkammers\u2019 multisensorial approach to learning. The newly public museums of the nineteenth century stopped being perceived as merely research facilities and instead became shrines to knowledge, requiring \u2018quiet and passive spectators to complete [their] purpose\u2019 (Bennett, 2013, p 16). This encouragement of silent contemplation was no doubt partially a result of public museum owners \u2013 in most cases, local governments \u2013 viewing these institutions as providers of educational and behavioural training to the lower classes who, through their exposure to museums, would become well-versed in the knowledge of the world\u2019s culture while reinforcing their identity as submissive, self-managed loyal subjects (Bennett, 1995, p 23). Public museums also became silent during an era when the elite within the UK began to view silence as necessary to facilitate creative, technical thought and the acquisition of knowledge. Several prominent authors of the time, including Charles Dickens, penned missives about their disdain for the noises of modernity \u2013 particularly the sounds generated by immigrants who worked as organ grinders and other types of street musicians in Victorian London (Picker, 2003, pp 60\u201361). Recent trends within twenty-first-century museum practice, such as the \u2018participatory museum\u2019/ \u2018Museum 2.0\u2019 movement championed by American museum professional Nina Simon, have sought to encourage visitor participation within the museum experience, allowing visitors to have an active voice within curatorial choices (Simon, 2010, p 33) and calling for museums to listen to their visitors \u2013 an overturning of this tradition of silent audiences. Museum 2.0\u2019s innovative strategy has worked to varying degrees, with some museums opening up their curatorial choices to public vote (Gamerman, 2014), or even redesigning their entire permanent collection displays in an attempt to be more visitor-friendly (Penney, 2009, p 35). With museums willing to go to such dramatic lengths as a complete redesign in order to simply be perceived as \u2018listening to audiences\u2019, it becomes easier to understand why writers such as Brian O\u2019Doherty have been declaring that museums are in a state of crisis since at least the advent of Modernism (O\u2019Doherty, 1972).As museums in the twenty-first century have begun grappling with new methods by which to engage with their audiences, philosophers and theorists have also begun grappling with new notions of something central to museums: objects. The emergence of object-oriented ontology within contemporary philosophy has radically redefined the relationship between objects and humans, in the process expanding the definition of objects to include colossal things like entire galaxies, or ephemeral things like ideas. As my work involves redefining sound as an object, it would appear that doing so within object-oriented ontology\u2019s broader scope might be a temptation; however, to do so would imply an agreement with OOO\u2019s \u2018refus[al] to treat objects as constructions of humans\u2019 (Bryant, 2011, p 18). It is my belief that this democratisation of objects and humans, while philosophically compelling, is fundamentally incompatible with the essence of museum practice as it exists today, a discipline based entirely upon humanity\u2019s desire to collect, categorise and display objects for the education and entertainment of humanity. Perhaps object-oriented ontology may become the basis for a future museum practice, but for now even radically progressive attempts to move museum practice beyond the traditional power structures between museums, objects and visitors such as the afore-mentioned Museum 2.0 movement still rely upon the belief that objects exist at the behest of humanity. Subsequently, I feel compelled to acknowledge the existence of object-oriented ontology while simultaneously asserting that, for the time being at least, I find it most useful outside the realm of museum practice for the time being.In recent years, museums have found themselves increasingly under the scrutiny of sound artists, especially field recordists. My own artistic research into the sonic experience of museums generates detailed sound maps of museum spaces. I visit each mapped museum as any other visitor would, conducting my work unannounced during regular public hours, on view but essentially in secret, recording the sounds that \u2018naturally\u2019 occur within museum spaces. These recordings unravel the stereotypical notion of a \u2018silent\u2019 museum (Kannenberg, 2016). Other museum-based recording projects, such as sound artist residencies like Aleks Kolkowski\u2019s work at the Science Museum in London (personal communication, 11 December 2014) and Matt Parker\u2019s \u2018Imitation Archive\u2019 at Bletchley Park (Parker, 2016) have involved large-scale recording sessions of the sounds generated by objects that are held within a museum\u2019s physical object collections \u2013 projects that have accomplished important work in generating sonic material for future display opportunities. To further explore the act of listening to sounds within a museum context, I have developed an experimental curatorial practice, establishing an institution \u2013 The Museum of Portable Sound \u2013 whose \u2018galleries\u2019 display digital audio files of my own field recordings of museums (as well as a broad range of other examples of sonic culture) on a single mobile phone (see Figure 2); the museum, although digital in nature, is not distributed online, but rather presented on an individual basis to visitors who make an appointment to listen to the museum along with me (Gray, 2017). The wide-reaching results of this curatorial experiment, to be published in the future, are at this point beyond the scope of the present article. However, my own thinking towards the project\u2019s central conceit \u2013 that sounds can be collected and exhibited as objects of culture \u2013 has led to this article\u2019s proposal for a new definition of the term \u2018sound object\u2019."},

These sources supplemented or replaced existing ones, constantly changing which resources we relied on most. Today, many countries are engaging for the first time in discussions about a deliberate and fundamental transformation of their energy supply. During the COP21 in Paris, 195 countries agreed to limit global warming by increasing the share of renewable energy and raising the overall energy efficiency or even by reducing fossil fuel subsidies (REN21, 2016, p 17). The two main goals are to reduce CO2\u00a0emissions and to achieve a fairer distribution of global emissions and resources. This politically guided transformation of the worldwide energy system is historically unprecedented. Whereas past energy transitions were generally based on exploiting new resources with a high energy density, the current transition is motivated by a broad political consensus. It is not meant to result in an increased energy demand but rather in a reduction of energy use (Kupper, 2016, p 15). While energy transition in general seems to be a unifying worldwide political goal, the paths to a sustainable energy system can be very different. The most notable difference between countries may be the role of nuclear energy. While Germany decided on a phase-out of nuclear energy, some countries judge nuclear energy to be an essential contributor to a sustainable energy supply system.\nThe exhibition energie.wenden reveals and disputes these different paths and invites visitors to actively take part in the political process of shaping energy transitions. This is reflected in content and design as well as in the exhibition title. Being a play on words energie.wenden can be interpreted in different ways: on the one hand it can be read as the plural of the German term Energiewende[1], indicating past and recent energy transitions. On the other hand, it is a direct invite to visitors to turn the existing energy supply system upside down. Hence the literal and more demanding translation of the exhibition title turn.energy.around. This call to action does not only relate to the German Energiewende but rather to the global challenge of energy transition. It rests on general facts and processes applicable to various areas worldwide and takes on an international perspective. The exhibition opened on 14 February 2017 at the Deutsches Museum. After being on display until 19 August 2018 the exhibition will travel to other museum destinations worldwide."},

As far as I am concerned I find my telephone almost useless, as I occupy more time in communicating through it than I should do if I went to the offices or places of business of nine out of ten of the persons with whom I wish to communicate. I have consequently given notice of my intention to discontinue the use of it when the term for which my subscription is paid ceases.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Clifford Dunn, Leeds telephone exchange subscriber, December 1881[1]\nThe simplicity of the instruments and systems of late-nineteenth century British exchange telephony, and the ease with which anyone could use them, was emphasised in most early telephone marketing (Baldwin, 1925; Feuerstein, 1990) and has been a feature, often tacitly assumed, of subsequent histories ever since.[2]\u00a0 Indeed, when the administrative historian Charles R Perry, writing in 1977 (Perry, 1977), asserted that the growth of British exchange telephony had been delayed in this period, he reached this conclusion largely because he assumed that the telephones of the time were unproblematic instruments, the benefits of which should have been immediately obvious to all.[3]\u00a0 However, users of late nineteenth-century telephone systems, such as Clifford Dunn, a Leeds solicitor quoted above from his 1888 letter to the Yorkshire Post, often found they were not as intuitive or as useful as expected.\nPerry's work, and his assertion of delay, has come to constitute the received view of British telephone history; many scholars have uncritically used Perry's narrative slant to sum up early British telephony as underdeveloped.[4]\u00a0 Perry's approach has therefore depressed interest in this rich but under-researched field. In an attempt to shed new light on discussions of early British telephony, this article examines problems which people in Britain encountered when they first interacted with exchange telephony from 1879, when the first exchanges were established, until the early 1890s, when the main intercity telephone wires, called trunk lines, were nationalised. Considering these problems, and their solutions, allows for a better understanding of the development of exchange systems in Britain in this period. Such problems also reveal why people might have chosen not to use exchange telephony, or been unable to use it. As the Science Museum marks the opening of the new Information Age gallery, at a time when telecommunication technologies in general, and social media in particular, are playing more and more central roles in our everyday lives, it is interesting to reflect on the ways in which people in the late nineteenth century responded to the possibilities opened up by what was arguably the first network-based telecommunications technology.[5]\u00a0 (Kingsbury, 1915)\nWhile other historical treatments of telephony have focused on areas such as business and institutional history and patents (Feuerstein, 1990), this paper considers usage as another factor in the development and proliferation of telephony. In exploring the social history of technology, this article has been influenced by Graeme Gooday's work on electricity with regard to Thomas Hughes; in his authoritative book on the spread and development of electric power, Hughes analysed this technology as a system which relied on a network of many different components, all of which had to be working in order for the whole to function efficiently (Hughes, 1983). However, Hughes failed to include the human users as equally important components of the system. As Gooday has pointed out, it is not correct simply to assume that home-owners wanted electricity, as many did not, and thus a tension needed to be resolved whereby either the technology or the attitude of the public needed to be altered in order for electric power to spread (Gooday, 2008).\nLike electric power, exchange telephony was a system, a network technology. However, the role of human users as components in telephone exchange networks was even more important in comparison to electric power, as the utility of the network to the individual was directly determined by the other people using it (Milne, 2007).[6]\u00a0 This meant that the attitudes of users comprised a key aspect for the providers of the technology to consider when they were seeking to optimise the functioning of the system. Likewise, problems affecting one person affected many, and problems that caused people not to use the technology were problems for the system as a whole. An analysis of these problems, and their solutions, will demonstrate the ways in which British exchange telephony developed in response to the requirements of the social components of the system.\nThe focus on the ability of non-users of technology to shape technological development is influenced by Sally Wyatt. She has argued that non-users of technologies, those who, willingly or not, either stop using a certain technology or never use it in the first place, are important to consider when looking at the development of that technology (Wyatt, 2003). These non-users of technologies can exert just as much influence over the development of the technologies in question as the users. Because the producers and suppliers of technologies want at least some of the non-users to become users, they are willing to alter technologies according to the opinions and attitudes of this potential market. As an examination of the problems with telephony will show, those who did not use telephone exchange systems played a larger role in their development than non-users of other technologies did in the development of those technologies. This was partly for the reasons Wyatt described, and partly for other reasons unique to telephony.\nThus, the problems examined here will be used to do three things: firstly, to counter Perry\u2019s narrative of delay by demonstrating that exchange telephony was not in this period an obviously useful technology which everyone, by default, would have wanted to use.\nSecondly, building on Hughes and Gooday, this article will determine the extent to which exchange telephony developed in response to these problems, and, finally, it will consider the impact that non-users had in shaping early telephone exchange development, thus supporting Wyatt's thesis."},

From 1647 to 1664 he worked as one of the surgeons at St Bartholomew\u2019s Hospital, and the casebook includes over 600 of these patients (Beier, 1988, pp 51\u201352). Lucinda McCray Beier (1988 and 1992) has offered the most extensive examination of this source, reading Binns\u2019 casebook for evidence of day-to-day practice and as a comparison to the published work of surgeons such as Charles II\u2019s sergeant surgeon, Richard Wiseman, for evidence of distinctions between theory and practice. Her final assessment is that Binns was \u2018cautious and very conventional\u2019 in his practice (1992, p 96). Lauren Kassell points to Binns\u2019 manuscripts as an exception to the prevalence of casebooks from surgeons who \u2018fashioned themselves as physicians\u2019, finding him instead to demonstrate \u2018little evident scholarly imperative\u2019 in his notes (2014, p 617). This pragmatic and decidedly surgical focus makes Binns a useful testing point for everyday surgical approaches to facial wounds in London during this time.The research presented here focuses on Binns\u2019 approach to facial wounds in dialogue with published tracts. It supports Beier\u2019s general assessment of Binns\u2019 conservatism by demonstrating, for example, that Binns resisted intervention in aesthetic cases that did not also involve pain or risk of further complications. This contrasts with evidence from more ambitious figures like London surgeon and physician Daniel Turner (1667\u20131741) who were willing to remove non-painful marks and growths (Cock, 2017). Officially, external treatment was the purview of the surgeon, while only physicians could administer internal medications, but in practice these lines were often blurred, and Binns frequently prescribed laxatives and emetics (Beier, 1992, p 81). He also records consultation or engagement with a number of surgeons and physicians, including John Woodall (1570\u20131643), who had also worked at St Bartholomew\u2019s. Woodall had extensive experience in army medicine before he was appointed the first surgeon-general of the East India Company in 1613 and he became well known for naval surgery after the publication of his guide to the field, The Surgions Mate (1617 and expanded in two subsequent editions) (Crawford, 1914, pp 19\u201320). Binns\u2019 casebook offers an additional resource to the medical history of the British Civil Wars by demonstrating forms of medical care available in the affiliated hospitals. There is increasingly exciting scholarship about the medical provisions available in this conflict, including specific attention to facial wounds in this and previous eras in which the face was the most exposed part of the soldier\u2019s body (Appleby and Hopper, 2018; Gruber von Arni, 2001; Tracy and DeVries, 2015). For example, in 2016 the new National Civil War Centre in Newark (Nottinghamshire) hosted an exhibition devoted to medical provisions available during the conflict, and prominently featured an imagined portrait of Parliamentarian Colonel William Forbes, who lost an eye and a significant amount of facial skin and muscle from the wind of a cannonball at the siege of Pontefract in January 1645, after which he was known as \u2018Blowface\u2019.[4] Scholarship on facial surgery in and following the First World War, including its broader cultural and psychosocial implications, is perhaps leading this field at present, having formed a significant thread of academic and public scholarship around the recent centenary.[5] While early modern discourses foregrounded the honour that could accompany the \u2018Hacks and Scars, those rugged Beauty Spots of War, which [men] wore as true marks of their undaunted Bravery\u2019 this potential was never uncontested, and cases like Forbes\u2019 highlight the capacity for public insults, disabling discomfort and rejection that could accompany more substantial changes to the face (Ward, 1700, sig. ix.O3v).[6]People with significant facial differences were regularly encountered in early modern Britain, and their appearance was commented upon. Samuel Pepys (1633\u20131703), who suffered his own eye troubles, records numerous men with one eye: ship\u2019s mate, Richard Cooper, for example, who teaches him mathematics; parliamentarian soldier John Hewson (d. 1662); a \u2018Frenchman with one eye\u2019 with whom he hails a coach (31/12/60); and the calligrapher Richard Hoare. Further mentions of people with visible eye issues include \u2018the faire Mrs. Margaret Wight\u2019 for whom \u2018the cast of her eye, got only by an ill habit, do [sic] her much wrong\u2019 (1/06/66); James, Duke of York, who wore patches after being struck in the face by a branch while hunting; the sailor John Daniel whose eye is temporarily \u2018stopped with okum\u2019 to cover a battle injury (4/06/66); and even the black eye Pepys himself inflicted on his wife, Elizabeth, on 19 December 1664 (Pepys, 1970\u20131983). There is also ample evidence in contemporary accounts of surgeons\u2019 and physicians\u2019 attempts to minimise such facial differences: Daniel Turner records the case of a boy who pierces his eye while sewing a football. When the boy\u2019s eye could not be saved he was fitted with a glass one by a Mr Boyce that was such a close match to his natural eye that neighbours \u2018could not distinguish the one from the other\u2019 (Turner, 1722, Vol 1, sig. Bb2). Prevalent diseases like smallpox and the pox (syphilis) caused characteristic disfigurements (which Binns treats with some frequency), while astringent medicaments used to treat these and other disorders could themselves cause further damage to the skin. Serious burns to the face appear frequently in surgical texts, and accidents, fights and deliberate attacks were further sources of facial injuries and scars. Wendy D Churchill\u2019s survey of many of these cases suggests that men were more subject to serious injuries and violence that might take them to the surgeon, while women might treat minor scalds and other injuries at home (2016, pp 50\u201354).\nEarly modern medical manuals for home and trade were full to bursting with ointments, washes and other concoctions to clear the skin, teeth and hair, and combat minor ailments that would have included aesthetic components, while the market was full of powders, patches, plumpers and pastes that could cover blemishes or fill in pockmarks or scars (Leong, 2008; Stobart, 2016; Jenner and Wallis, 2007).\nVolumes like Hannah Woolley\u2019s The Accomplish\u2019d Lady\u2019s Delight in Preserving, Physick, Beautifying, and Cookery (London: B Harris, 1675) contained numerous recipes for the face and body alongside domestic food preparation, for example. There was therefore no shortage of work for practitioners who could offer special skills in treating facial wounds and conditions.\n\u00a0\n%MCEPASTEBIN%"},

Watt (1736\u20131819) is best known for his work improving the steam engine, taking Newcomen\u2019s inefficient atmospheric engine and transforming it into the precision-built machine which became emblematic of Britain\u2019s Industrial Revolution. However, as Miller describes, he was a man of many parts, and his career encompassed fields as diverse as pottery, instrument-making, sculpture, chemistry and natural philosophy. Miller has now expanded upon his wide-ranging previous studies around Watt into the most readable, authoritative and up to date work on this enigmatic figure. The book balances historical narrative with thematic analysis, mastery of scientific and biographical details, and synthesis of recent historiography. \u00a0The book is an attempt to get behind the classic definition of Watt as a \u2018genius\u2019, to explore his character, and reveal the \u2018springs of his achievement\u2019 \u2013 his motivations, as broadly defined (Miller, 2019, p xiii). This approach reveals what we may term the major creative tension in Watt\u2019s working life and interests: empiricism and craft, versus natural philosophy. Investigating their interplay in Watt\u2019s projects reveals a \u2018consistent set of philosophical (notably chemical) interpretations lying behind his inventive activity\u2019 (Miller, 2019, p xii). Miller also goes to considerable lengths to downplay the traditional view of Watt as a solitary character, arguing that his work was the product of \u2018collective enterprise\u2019, drawing upon close and able support by numerous business associates, friends, family members and artisans.The first three chapters outline Watt\u2019s early life in Greenock, London and Glasgow, as apprentice, shopkeeper, instrument-maker and surveyor. Here Miller portrays Watt as an \u2018improver\u2019 in the best Scottish traditions of that word, before introducing Watt\u2019s business partnership with Matthew Boulton.Thereafter Miller takes a thematic approach outlining what he sees as major aspects of Watt\u2019s life which have generally been understated. Chapter 4 explores Watt\u2019s \u2018regular, episodic, and enduring\u2019 natural philosophical work from the 1780s (Miller, 2019, p 153). This work encompassed a range of projects, the outputs of which extended beyond what was required to complete the immediate task in hand, to construct a coherent \u2018chemistry of heat\u2019. Doing so required engagement with natural philosophical forums, and this in turn helped promote the engine-building business to customers as based on philosophical as much as pragmatic ends. Chapter 5 focuses on the social framework which supported Watt in his labours. As Miller puts it, everyone involved had their individual roles to play, but common to all was the laborious need \u2018to cope with, and work around, the anxieties and vexations that plagued the principal lead in Team Watt\u2019 (Miller, 2019, p 202\u2013203). Again, Miller emphasises how presenting Watt as the lone genius developing the company\u2019s products was canny marketing which paid commercial dividends.Chapter 6 covers a neglected facet of Watt\u2019s career, namely how much money he actually made from his endeavours, and what he did with it. He invested in significant estates and cultivated a reputation as an \u2018avuncular sage\u2019 which ensured that he had social support later in life when deaths of family members and friends left him alone (Miller, 2019, p xvi). The traditional division of labour between Watt and Boulton has the latter driven by what he termed elsewhere \u2018love of a money-getting ingenious project\u2019, and Watt motivated by somewhat more philosophical concerns \u2013 but Watt delighted in the fruits of his labours too. Miller estimates that he had made about \u00a3150,000 from his business interests by 1800 (with the purchasing power of around \u00a36.5m today), yet his estate was valued at probate at \u00a360,000. Evidently Watt spent a lot on much else during his retirement years, in effect becoming a landed gentleman with a continued philosophical bent. The final two chapters consider Watt as a legendary figure during his own lifetime and then in posterity. Watt spent considerable time with his son James Jnr carefully crafting his self-image, helped by painters and sculptors including Thomas Lawrence, William Beechey and Francis Chantrey. Also prominent here is consideration that, for all their philosophical underpinnings, Boulton and Watt dealt ruthlessly with competitors if circumstances made it necessary. Posthumously, James Jnr continued with the \u2018filial project\u2019 of burnishing his father\u2019s reputation. This led to the creation of an image of Watt, defined by Miller as \u2018a man for all causes\u2019. This view of Watt, however, suffered setbacks in the twentieth century as he fell from prominence despite the preservation of an enormous physical record in both objects and archives, at Birmingham, South Kensington and elsewhere. There is much to like about this book. I particularly enjoyed the material on Watt\u2019s supporting cast, including the robust, large-than-life engineers Isaac Perrins, James Lawson, Joseph Harrison and Richard Cartwright, who in Miller\u2019s words \u2018took on much of the detailed work in the engine and other businesses and also sometimes, in experimental enquiry\u2019 (Miller, 2019, p 167). The vicissitudes undergone by many of Watt\u2019s physical memorials, from the epic-scale statue by Chantrey which ruptured the floor of Westminster Abbey when it was first placed there, to his complete workshop preserved since 1924 in the Science Museum, also make fascinating reading. They remind us that the survival of any physical artefact is as much guided by luck as by providence. Also valuable in a subject as legend-ridden as Watt are pithy appraisals of sources (Miller, 2019, p 115).When I began reading this book my main concern was that here again was an enormous piece of \u2018Wattolatry\u2019, the word coined by John Griffiths for \u2018the worship of Watt\u2019 (Torrens, 2000). Miller speaks of path dependency at one point, the term used by economists to explain the continuance down a set technological path of subsequent technologies, and the term is particularly apposite for Watt, given the relative abundance of related material to study compared to so many of his contemporaries. However, the book successfully lifts Watt from beneath what Miller describes as \u2018the weight of legend formation and myth-making\u2019 (Miller, 2019, p xviii) that he has been subject to, looking over his shoulder to a rich and intriguing cast of supporting actors, and raising new questions about this most interesting of historical periods."},

Building the base structureThe first step in our reconstruction project was building the ear phonautograph\u2019s main structure. To ensure a high degree of historical accuracy throughout this and the rest of the fabrication phase, we relied predominantly on primary research documents for clues pertaining to the instrument\u2019s possible size, shape, material construction and functional characteristics. The most important primary source texts available to us were two research reports written by Blake pertaining to the fabrication and operation of the ear phonautograph (Blake, 1875; Blake, 1876), and one report written by Bell articulating the significance of the instrument in relation to his work on the telephone (Bell, 1877). These documents included descriptions of various components of the instrument \u2013 from the design of mechanisms controlling the movement of the smoked glass plate, to the preparation of the sensitive middle ear components and stylus, to the mechanical operation of the final instrument. They also included two images \u2013 one photograph published by Blake (1876) and a line drawing published by Bell (1877) \u2013 that provided us with a close visual approximation of what our reconstruction should look like once it was completed (see Figures 1 and 2).[17]For all the detail present in these reports, one of the first surprises we encountered in attempting to fabricate the ear phonautograph\u2019s main structure was how little information was provided on its material construction. Even in Blake\u2019s reports \u2013 which devoted many pages to describing minute details, such as how the ear specimen should be excised and prepared to achieve the best possible phonautographic outcome \u2013 no information was provided as to how to actually replicate the main structure upon which this and the other components were affixed. This meant that educated guesswork was necessary to determine exactly what materials to use in our structure, how each element should be fabricated and assembled, and how each component should then be arranged in order to recreate the instrument\u2019s original functionality.To fill in the gaps left by these primary source texts, we decided to pay a visit to the Canada Science and Technology Museum\u2019s permanent artefact reserves to see if other scientific instruments, manufactured during the same historical period (c. 1870s), might offer clues as to the possible materials and design principles Bell and Blake may have applied in building their instrument. Of those we consulted, a collection of microscopes immediately stood out as having a close resemblance to the ear phonautograph\u2019s main structure. Some common elements included a three-pronged base, two-part cylindrical stem, rectangular staging assembly, and machined brass finish. The resemblance was so uncanny, in fact, that we began to wonder if the ear phonautograph\u2019s base structure might actually be a microscope that was modified by Bell and Blake to achieve a different functionality. Upon closer inspection, we found compelling evidence to support this idea. Located on the lower stem of each of the microscopes was a small circular mirror that would have been used to reflect light upwards through the bottom of the glass stage for the illumination of microscope slides. An identical mirror is clearly visible in Bell\u2019s line drawing of the ear phonautograph, as is an empty semi-circular bracket in Blake\u2019s photograph that would have at one time been used to house such a mirror. This strongly suggested that Bell and Blake had not had their instrument custom-machined, but had instead simply borrowed a common microscope and adapted it to suit their purposes: namely, by removing the upper ocular components, and introducing new elements that would permit the structure to function suitably as a phonautographic apparatus. Incidentally, we were surprised to learn \u2013 upon doing keyword searches shortly after making this discovery \u2013 that we were not the first to notice this similarity. An article published by Charles Snyder in 1974 on Bell and Blake\u2019s research collaborations includes an off-hand remark that \u2018[t]he whole affair [the ear phonautograph] was mounted on a microscope stand\u2019 (pp 12\u201313). Whether Snyder arrived at this conclusion independently, through a close examination of surviving images of the ear phonautograph, or by some other means is impossible to say, for he offers no evidence or additional commentary to support this claim. Regardless, our preliminary material investigation suggested that he was most likely correct in making this assumption.Rather than fabricate a new microscope stand ourselves, we decided to acquire a period (c. 1870s) microscope to serve as the main structure of our reconstruction. This, we reasoned, would have the dual benefit of increasing the historical accuracy of our build while also ensuring that we wouldn\u2019t inadvertently overlook any of the functionalities contained within the original microscope that might bear some hidden significance to the ear phonautograph\u2019s operation. We estimated the size of the microscope based on approximate measurements of a human middle ear \u2013 our only reliable dimensional reference point \u2013 and proceeded to visit antique dealers and monitor local classified ads to source an instrument suitable for our build. We eventually located and purchased an ideally-sized microscope on eBay, which our designer then prepared for use in the reconstruction by dismantling the upper ocular portion of the instrument and removing all extraneous components that didn\u2019t appear to match up with the images provided in Bell and Blake\u2019s reports. We then set to work determining which additional components would need to be added to the base structure in order to complete its conversion into a functional phonautographic instrument. Of these, we decided to proceed first with the mouthpiece and moving glass assembly.\n\u00a0\nII. Constructing the mouthpieceFrom Blake\u2019s descriptions, it seemed clear that the purpose of the \u2018bell-shaped mouth-piece\u2019 (Blake, 1876, p 112) was relatively straightforward: to collect sound waves produced by a human speaker, and then funnel these sounds into a tube leading directly into the auditory canal of the excised middle ear. Disappointingly, as with the main structure, neither Bell nor Blake\u2019s reports offered any concrete information about what the mouthpiece was made of, nor any clues as to where or how it may have been acquired. Based on our previous microscope discovery, we hypothesised that the mouthpiece too had likely not been custom-made, but had instead been borrowed from another pre-existing instrument. To determine exactly which instrument it may have come from, we returned to the Canada Science and Technology Museum\u2019s artefact reserves to examine a selection of late nineteenth century wax cylinder phonograph and dictation machines that appeared to employ similar bell-shaped mouthpieces. Unfortunately, this investigation proved inconclusive. We were unable to locate any mouthpieces with a similar shape and finish to the one depicted in Bell and Blake\u2019s images, and were left with no alternative but to guess what the mouthpiece was made of and set about fabricating it ourselves.Our designer proposed fashioning the mouthpiece out of thin brass strips, which he felt would best approximate the look and finish of the mouthpiece as depicted in our reference images. This material would also provide maximum flexibility in terms of how it could be cut and coloured, and had the additional benefit of not adding too much additional weight to the overall structure. Once this was agreed upon, he set about preparing ten brass strips which were then hammered into shape and soldered together to form the requisite bell shape of the mouthpiece (see Figure 4). To the narrow base of the mouthpiece, he then affixed a short cylindrical steel rod that would serve to funnel sounds directly from the mouthpiece into the ear canal of the middle ear specimen once it was completed (see Figure 5).\nIII: Constructing the moving glass assemblyThe construction of the moving glass assembly was in some ways less complicated than the structure and mouthpiece, as Blake offered considerably more information on its fabrication and function. Its purpose was to translate physical vibrations from the stylus into a continuous visible etching on a moving plate of smoked glass. The assembly consisted of four main components: a smoked glass plate (to record the etching), a carriage (to carry the glass plate), a flat rectangular stage (to provide a surface for the carriage to glide across), and a pulley system (to ensure the glass plate maintained an even pace as it passed beneath the stylus). Despite the high level of detail present in Blake\u2019s descriptions of the moving glass assembly, we quickly discovered inconsistencies in his descriptions that needed to be resolved before the build could comfortably proceed. For example, in his earlier (1875, p 122) description of these components, he describes \u2018a metallic stage six inches in length, upon which slides a metal carriage carrying a glass plate\u2019 (my emphasis). In his later (1876, p 112) description, he instead describes \u2018a metallic stage having a glass bed six inches in length, upon which slides a glass carriage carrying a glass plate\u2019 (my emphasis). Without knowing which report represented the most accurate description of the instrument, we opted to follow Blake\u2019s latter instructions and build a brass stage with a glass bed, which we felt would provide a smooth and abrasion-free surface for the smoked glass plate to glide across. With respect to the carriage and plate components, we were perplexed as to why the smoked glass plate would require a carriage at all \u2013 be it metal or glass \u2013 as a glass plate alone could easily achieve both functions. Perhaps the goal of the carriage was to make the glass plates easier to prepare and change out, as only the carriage would require holes to be bored into its surface to permit the plate to be pulled across the stage (see next paragraph). Since Blake offered no additional information to clarify the design or purpose of this element, and since it was unclear in the surviving images of the ear phonautograph where the carriage ended and the plate began, we opted to forgo the construction of a separate glass carriage and instead use a single piece of glass that would act as both carriage and plate. This would simplify the build for testing purposes while also reducing the complexity of the instrument\u2019s operation since only one component would need to be in motion at once. Once the glass plate was cut and ready for installation, our designer proceeded to bore two holes through the top of each side and insert two metallic nubs that could be used to pull it horizontally across the stage. This pulling action could be achieved by hand, or alternatively \u2013 as Blake (1876, p 112) suggested \u2013 by tying a cord with a weight attached to one of the nubs, and then threading the cord through a pulley installed at the edge of the stage. When the weight was dropped, the pulley would ensure the moving glass plate would maintain an even and uniform pace for the duration of its glide across the stage.[18] To preserve this function, our designer fabricated a similar pulley system \u2013 clearly visible in both surviving images of the instrument \u2013 and sourced an appropriate cord made of linen thread that could be used for further experimentation. He then proceeded to smoke the top of the glass plate with soot from a candle\u2019s flame and place the plate on top of the glass-bedded stage, where it would be poised to receive etchings once the tympanic apparatus was completed (see Figures 6 and 7).\nIV. Fabricating the tympanic apparatusOnce the mouthpiece and moving glass tray assembly were completed and affixed to the main structure, the final step was figuring out what to do about the most iconic piece of the puzzle: the human middle ear. Although we were committed to producing the instrument with as much faithfulness to the original as possible, we had serious concerns about obtaining a real human specimen for use in our reconstruction. For one, the ear was \u2013 and remains \u2013 one of the most controversial aspects of the original instrument. To date, nobody has been able to say for certain who was \u2018the true hero \u2013 a specimen of a human ear \u2013 donor unknown\u2019 (Snyder, 1974, p 3), though the ear(s) were likely acquired without prior consent and by potentially dubious means (see Sterne, 2001; Ma, forthcoming 2020).[19] Blake himself was opaque on the issue, stating only that the \u2018membranes employed in [our] experiments have been preferably those of the human subject, as being most readily obtainable under favourable conditions\u2019 (Blake, 1876, p 110). Interpreted historically, this statement becomes both problematic and unsettling. As Ming-Yuen S Ma writes:\nI can find no information on the race of the body that provided the ears for the ear phonautograph, but given the historical conditions, their provenance is likely from an executed criminal, or a poor person whose body was unclaimed. Perhaps they were from a black man or woman whose grave was robbed? Or perhaps all of the above? (Ma, forthcoming 2020)\nJonathan Sterne remarks that Blake\u2019s \u2018casual attitude toward the ears in the phonautograph likely came from his professional milieu\u2019 (Sterne, 2001, p 271), in which the acquisition of bodies for experimentation and research purposes was considered the norm. By contrast, anecdotal evidence suggests that Bell may have been more self-conscious \u2013 if strategically so \u2013 about how the public might respond to the uncomfortable realities surrounding their instrument:\n...the strangeness of carrying around a machine consisting in part of a human ear was not lost on its inventors. As was Bell\u2019s practice, he spent the summer of 1874 with his parents in Brantford [Canada]. Bell brought his machine with him, and word quickly got around the town that he had a machine with a dog\u2019s ear or a pig\u2019s ear affixed to it. One biographer [Snyder, 1974, p 13] speculates that Bell himself propagated these rumours in order to prevent gossip about a human ear (Sterne, 2001, p 271).\nBeyond historical concerns, there were also questions about whether we could ethically justify acquiring a real human ear for our own experimental purposes. Or indeed, whether absolute verisimilitude to the original ear phonautograph was even necessary to obtain sufficient knowledge about its design and functionality. As an alternative, we briefly considered the possibility of substituting the human ear for the ear of a deceased animal, sourced from a local slaughterhouse. But even here, ethical and practical questions remained. In particular, we were concerned about our ability to procure and adequately prepare an appropriate specimen, to ethically justify and interpret this modification to the original ear phonautograph\u2019s design for museum visitors, and to ensure the long-term exhibition and preservation of a specimen composed entirely of sensitive biological tissue. So rather than employ a biological ear in our reconstruction \u2013 human or animal \u2013 we decided to instead experiment with modern materials to best approximate its desired appearance and functionality. We reasoned that much had changed in the development of synthetic materials over the last hundred and fifty years, and so by taking advantage of these materials we might fabricate an artificial ear that could approximate both the visual appearance and mechanical operation of a real human ear, while also making it easier to display and preserve.To achieve this compromise, we reached out to the University of Ottawa Health Sciences Library for help. We hoped that their experienced technical staff might assist us with producing a biologically accurate facsimile of a human middle ear that would be suitable for our reconstruction. After several consultations, they suggested the best approach would be to digitally \u2018excise\u2019 the portion of the ear we required from a 3D scan of a real human skull, which could then be printed using a 3D printer. We felt this approach was ideal, and so library technician Isabelle Castonguay set to work producing a plastic 3D print from a 3D scan found in the US National Institute of Health\u2019s open-source 3D Print Exchange (see Figures 8 and 9).[20]\nOnce the print was completed, our designer then customised the ear by trimming and sanding down the edges to achieve a closer visual approximation to the ear pictured in our reference images, and then painting it to resemble real human bone tissue (he used a beef soup bone to approximate the appropriate colour and shading). The final artificial ear specimen is pictured in Figure 10.\nThe only parts of the ear that could not be 3D-printed were the sensitive middle ear components: namely, the tympanic membrane and ossicle bones. To create these, our designer consulted a variety of anatomical drawings and scientific descriptions to better understand the shape, construction and operation of the human hearing apparatus. He then painstakingly sculpted the ossicle bones out of boxwood \u2013 selected for its stability and ease of modification \u2013 and attached them to a thin silicon membrane to replicate the shape and flexibility of a biological tympanic membrane (see Figures 11 and 12).[21] According to him, this was far and away the most difficult aspect of the project. Not only were the components exceedingly small, but affixing them in such a way as to maintain a free but structured movement between the ossicle bones and tympanic membrane \u2013 while also ensuring a certain tension in the membrane, conducive to the transmission of vibrations to the stylus \u2013 proved exceptionally difficult. This effort was necessary, however, because unless these components were assembled with a high level of anatomical accuracy, we had little hope that the instrument would function like the original once it was completed.\nTo create the sound-etching stylus \u2013 the physical constitution of which Blake (1875, p 123) described as \u2018a matter of considerable importance\u2019 \u2013 our designer endeavoured to follow Blake\u2019s instructions to the letter. In the second of Blake\u2019s two reports on the ear phonautograph (1876, p 112), he describes in detail the significance of attaining a stylus that was \u2018very light and firm, and sufficiently elastic to bend easily when its point is pressed upon the glass plate, and should be so stiff as to have but little vibration of its own\u2019. He also describes in detail some of the different materials he experimented with for this piece of the instrument \u2013 including \u2018styles of horse-hair, bristles, cane fibres, split bamboo and the like\u2019 \u2013 before determining that \u2018the best style for the purpose was obtained by splitting long wheat straw, scraping the inner cortical substance away, and separating single fibres\u2019 (ibid).[22] To best approximate this stylus, our designer successfully obtained several samples of split wheat straw from a farm in western Canada which he deemed to be reasonably close to Blake\u2019s ideal. He then proceeded to attach the finished stylus to the ossicle bones inside the middle ear with a drop of hot wax (see Figures 13\u201315).[23]\nThe final step in the initial fabrication phase was preparing the ear specimen for installation onto the main structure. Our designer achieved this in the same manner described by Blake in his 1876 report (pp 111\u20132): \u2018by means of thumb-screws passing through holes bored in the squamous portion of the [skull] bone.\u2019 Once the installation was finished, our initial ear phonautograph prototype was complete (see Figure 16).\nV. Revising the initial prototypeUpon completing the prototype, several issues became apparent that we had not anticipated at the outset of the build. The first problem was the overall instability of the finished structure. More specifically, the three-pronged base of the microscope appeared too small to support the weight of the moving glass assembly and the instrument became tippy and unsafe to operate. After reviewing the instrument against our reference images, it became clear that the original base was indeed larger than ours. More than this, a closer examination seemed to indicate that the base was positioned differently than most period microscopes we had reviewed in the Museum\u2019s collection.[24] This suggested that the base of the original instrument might have also been adapted by Blake as he encountered similar difficulties. Rather than search for a larger base, we instead endeavoured to machine one that better matched the shape and size as depicted in Bell and Blake\u2019s reports. We enlisted a member of our production staff, Paulus Heebink, who set to work developing a base pattern that could then be cast in brass by a local machinist. Once the new base was produced, he then affixed it to the structure and inserted an additional stem extension in order to increase the overall height and stability of the instrument. While it\u2019s impossible to say to what extent Blake would have altered the microscope structure to end up with his final version, we can say with some certainty \u2013 upon comparing our reproduction against the original images \u2013 that he either started with a larger microscope or made similar adjustments as we had.[25] Once we were done, the new prototype looked a lot closer to the original and functioned in a much more stable and usable way (see Figure 17).\nThe second element that appeared problematic upon our review of the finished prototype was, surprisingly, our custom-built mouthpiece. While we were initially confident that the mouthpiece would have been made of metal, upon second glance our mouthpiece did not quite match the look of the original. Indeed, in comparing the two side-by-side, it appeared the original was much more likely made of leather or some other pliable material. This material might have been chosen in order to prevent excessive resonance from building up and passing from the mouthpiece to the ear (thereby impacting the clarity of the final etching); or it may have been selected to better mimic the fleshy constitution of a biological outer ear. Sadly, neither Bell nor Blake offer any commentary that might illuminate the rationale behind this decision. Nevertheless, we have since decided to fabricate a new mouthpiece that might bring it closer to the original so as to support further and potentially more accurate experimentation. We\u2019re hoping to have this new and improved mouthpiece constructed and affixed to the prototype by end of next year (2020).Finally, while the most exciting part of the project has been observing that \u2013 from a mechanical standpoint \u2013 the instrument operates remarkably well, the most disappointing part has been discovering that our artificial middle ear has proven to be an inadequate substitute for the real thing. While a silicon tympanic membrane was selected specifically for its thinness and pliability, preliminary experimentation suggests that it is still too stiff in comparison to that of a real human ear, and we have thus far been unable to replicate the sensitive etchings of the original ear phonautograph (see Figure 18). The question persists as to whether \u2013 one hundred and fifty years after the original experiment \u2013 there indeed exists an artificial material that could allow us to do away with this key component of the instrument. For now, it appears that the same challenge that led Bell and Blake to resort to a real human middle ear remains for us."},

The workshop was acquired by the museum from Watt\u2019s home, \u2018Heathfield\u2019, at Handsworth in Birmingham, in 1924 (see Figure 1).\nIn that year, the workshop and its complete contents (more than 8,400 objects), along with the door and window, skylight, floorboards, and even a section of the banisters from outside, complete with a shelf where servants could allegedly leave food for Watt if he was heavily engaged within, were all packed up and transported to South Kensington.\nThe workshop is a fascinating survival: not a modern museum \u2018room setting\u2019, but a complete and original time capsule. When Watt had Heathfield built in 1790, as he began to extricate himself from a long career building steam engines with his business partner Matthew Boulton, he put aside a room on the second floor for storage. Gradually, this room was transformed from a store into a well equipped workshop with a stove, chests of drawers and a cupboard, shelves, a lathe and a workbench. Watt\u2019s wife possibly had a hand in his removal to the attic. Being endowed with \u2018the thrifty and far-seeing habits of the most enlightened Scotch housewifery\u2019 (which extended to having the family\u2019s pet dogs trained to wipe their feet when they entered the house), she would surely not have tolerated Watt\u2019s penchant for mess-generating experiments of all kinds anywhere else (Hankin (ed), 1859).\nWhen Watt died in 1819, the workshop and its contents were left to his son, James Watt Junior, and the room was carefully locked up and left entirely untouched at least until he in turn died in 1848. After that date, a very few visitors were permitted entry. Watt\u2019s biographer J P Muirhead, who visited the workshop in 1853, described it as a \u2018religio loci\u2019, a place of sanctity, and an industrial shrine to Watt the steam engineer where no \u2018profane hand\u2019 had been allowed to \u2018violate the sanctities\u2019 of this \u2018magical retreat\u2019 (Muirhead, 1854).\nA decade later, Francis Pettit-Smith of the Patent Office Museum, whose collection formed a nucleus for the Science Museum, wrote to Watt\u2019s great-grandson James Gibson-Watt. \u2018How often I have longed to take a peep into Heathfield\u2026where I am informed a host of invaluable relics do still exist \u2013 which in honour to the illustrious man should once more see the daylight \u2013 and be preserved to the end of time in some public institute like this[1]. This rather unsubtle approach was continued when Pettit-Smith, along with Bennet Woodcroft, the Museum\u2019s founder, finally gained entrance to the workshop in April 1864. The two men fought to open the door for 20 minutes, accidentally broke one of the windows, and Woodcroft left his glasses behind afterwards having spent seven hours examining the workshop\u2019s contents[2].\nThereafter, the workshop remained at Heathfield all the way up to 1924, 105 years after Watt\u2019s death. The contents were in poor condition, having been subject to extremes of heat in summer, and cold in winter, with the wooden items sometimes attacked by woodworm. As Birmingham expanded in the 1920s, Heathfield, and the grounds around it, were sold for development. A final set of photographs commissioned by the Science Museum at the end of 1924 shows the workshop contents covered with dirt, and a view from the window reveals neglected brick-work, tiles slipping from the roof, and the grounds and outbuildings decaying[3]. In December, H W Dickinson, the Science Museum\u2019s curator of mechanical engineering, arrived with trucks and men to remove the workshop contents. How close the house was to being swept away is suggested by the floorboards and other structural elements having to be acquired separately, not from Watt\u2019s descendants, but from those redeveloping the site.\nThe workshop was a practical workplace for Watt, but it was also his personal museum: it contains remnants of many of his earlier projects, from those on the nature and properties of heat, through the ingredients used in devising ink for letter-copying purposes, to ways of mass-producing musical and scientific instruments \u2013 a reminder that Watt began his career as an instrument-maker and merchant in Glasgow following a brief spell in London in 1755\u201356.\nAs well as tools and instruments, many of the objects in the workshop would have had deep personal resonance for Watt. In one corner remains a trunk containing the school books, drawings, paintings and writings of his son Gregory, who died of tuberculosis in 1804, aged only 27. More enigmatically, among the many plaster moulds that sit on the workshop shelves (themselves a rare survival of the plaster copy industry that grew in the early 19th century based on the work of itinerant Italian mould-makers) sits a mould which, when taken apart, reveals the imprinted fingers of a small child: perhaps a keepsake of one of Watt\u2019s three children who died in infancy.\nFinally, on the bed of one of Watt\u2019s sculpture-copying machines, which were his major interest in retirement, and the only project carried to fruition in the workshop, rests a death-mask of Matthew Boulton, who died in 1809. The mask became a subject for Watt to multiply on the copying machines. The impression of Watt one obtains from the evidence of the workshop is of some sadness, of family and friends slipping away, as Watt sat by the stove in his garret.\nThe contents of the workshop are also revealing in other ways. Although the contents were meticulously listed in a series of inventories during the later 19th century, the occasional \u2018rogue\u2019 object has surfaced: for example, a large, inverted ceramic cone, which curators had assumed to be a part of Watt\u2019s chemical experiments, turned out on further research to be a lavatory bowl dating from the 1850s onwards. Research also suggests that the Pemberton family, tenants who lived at Heathfield in the 1860s, allowed their children to get their hands on the workshop key \u2013 they had already found Watt\u2019s old furniture stored in an out-house, and \u2018filled up corners and other odd spaces in play and bed-rooms with costly old cabinets and bureaux and within them displayed our treasures\u2019 (Pemberton, 1905). Later photographs of objects preserved in an album held by the Heathfield Historical Society shows mineral models made of boxwood removed from the workshop and lined up to spell out the word \u2018CRYSTALS\u2019 (Digital Handsworth: Boxwood crystals made by James Watt, [online]). Rather than being an untouched place of sanctity, it would appear that the objects inside the workshop sometimes had rather itinerant lives.\nIn seeking to redisplay the workshop in a new exhibition, it was necessary to locate Watt in the broader historiography of the later 18th century. In his book James Watt, Chemist (the latest in a series of books by different authors examining the work of this great engineer and polymath), David Miller has written an invigorating exploration of a career where designing and building steam engines happened in close conjunction with chemical experiments. In his lifetime, Watt was an influential chemist as well as an engineer, and he took care to emphasise the philosophical nature of his work on the properties of steam, as opposed to the industrial applications of its power. This path was also adopted by Watt Jnr, who assiduously cultivated the memory of his late father as a philosopher after he died in 1819, and who became the custodian of the workshop in that year (Miller, 2004).\nThe story that the young Watt experimented with a kettle and from it deduced the capabilities of steam became a parable for steam-powered Victorian Britain, captured and romanticised in a series of popular prints and other images. The story itself has become the subject of controversy: most recently, David Miller has revealed how Watt Jnr subtly altered the original account of the kettle incident so that it reflected an interest in steam\u2019s philosophical properties (Miller, 2004).\nThe fascination with the kettle story in the 19th century can be neatly encapsulated in another acquisition made by the Patent Office Museum, in 1863. Francis Pettit-Smith was in touch with J W Gibson-Watt, then head of the Watt family, concerning a \u2018kettle\u2019 said to be in his possession, which had belonged to James Watt himself. After some consideration, Gibson-Watt wrote that although the kettle had been removed by James Watt Jnr following his father's death in 1819, it was \u2018not a \u201ctea kettle\u201d at all, and I am satisfied it is not...the one which he originally observed the steam lifting the lid when boiling on the fire\u2019. However, it was \u2018evidently made by his orders and used as an experimentalising steam kettle, it has a moveable funnel and two parts that lift out\u2019[4]. Francis Pettit-Smith remained intrigued, replying that \u2018of course the identical kettle referred to in the paper article would have been if possible more interesting than the one which you have in your possession. Still as this one was actually constructed for and used by James Watt in his early investigations of the properties of steam it cannot fail to attract great notice and prove to be a very interesting + valuable acquisition'[5].\nThe kettle was subsequently delivered to the Patent Office Museum by Richard Banks, Gibson-Watt\u2019s solicitor[6]. It remains in the Science Museum\u2019s collection, and is on display in the Secret Life of the Home gallery[7] (see Figure 2).\nThe account of the kettle\u2019s acquisition is interesting for two reasons. First, considerable enthusiasm was shown for the object even though it was not what it was originally conceived to be \u2013 its associations alone were enough to make it a valuable acquisition[8]. Second, the exchange of letters about the kettle is couched in the language of philosophy, using words like \u2018experimentalising\u2019, and referring to the \u2018properties\u2019 of steam. Pettit-Smith appears anxious to use the terms that Watt himself would have favoured, but they are at odds with many of the Patent Office Museum\u2019s other acquisitions at this time, particularly Watt\u2019s \u2018Old Bess\u2019 and \u2018Lap\u2019 steam engines, which were very much about steam as an industrial power source[9] (see Figure 3).\nIn the acquisition of the alleged Watt kettle, and Watt\u2019s workshop, are captured two different ideas of Watt, as a philosopher and as a craftsman. The balance between these two has varied over time. During the 19th century, Watt\u2019s engineering achievements were afforded far greater prominence over his philosophical and chemical background. Other historians have picked up on these competing interpretations of Watt, particularly Christine MacLeod, in Heroes of Invention (MacLeod, 2007). Here, MacLeod explores how Watt became a highly contested figure, appropriated and re-appropriated by a series of different interest groups. Watt was the first engineer to ascend into Britain\u2019s pantheon of national heroes, where he was later joined by others including George Stephenson and Isambard Kingdom Brunel, as Britain was transformed by bold new civil-engineering projects. As the 19th century drew to a close, engineers and inventors were being praised less as scientists, and \u2018applied science\u2019 attained greater prominence (MacLeod, &amp; Tann, 2007). By the centenary of Watt\u2019s death in 1919, he had once more become a revered craftsman and engineer[10]. Most recently, Watt\u2019s philosophical and chemical interests, and his role in the wider Enlightenment, have been reassessed[11].\nAs has been suggested by David Miller, Watt was subject to a set of competing forces, concerning representations and realities, the mechanical and the chemical, philosophy and craft (Miller, 2009). Although Watt has often been defined in polar terms, as either philosopher or craftsman, mechanic or chemist, the physical evidence of the workshop allows us to expand upon what Miller has already said and argue for Watt as a liminal figure, existing in an intermediate state between different extremes. Specific aspects of one of these polar relationships have often been emphasised in the construction of a particular historical argument, but the workshop suggests that all these different aspects could be accommodated within a single person: Watt lived in many different worlds.\nThe workshop was acquired as a shrine to the man Thomas Carlyle called \u2018Watt of the Steam engine\u2026this man with blackened fingers, with grim brow\u2026searching out, in his Workshop, the Fire-secret\u2019 (Carlyle, 1869). However, there is very little in the workshop pertaining to the steam engine. Out of more than 8,000 objects, only seven or eight can be linked directly to Watt\u2019s steam projects, although what there is has proved to be very significant, such as the original model of the separate condenser, which was concealed amid the mess of objects on the workbench until the late 1960s, when it was finally identified by Rodney Law (Law, 1969). These steam artefacts are accompanied by a multiplicity of other items, covering not just science and technology, but aspects of the decorative arts and the world of consumption, too. There are 26 plaster moulds to copy figures designed after the Antique as well as some hundreds of small pieces of sculpture, cameos and portrait medallions intended as feedstock for Watt\u2019s sculpture-copying machines. The workshop drawers contain tools intended for the manufacture of musical instruments: there is a complete set of tools, reamers and rotary files for making flutes in bulk, and \u2018purfling\u2019 tools to inlay thin strips of wood into the bodies of stringed instruments[12]. There are also more than 140 different chemical substances tied up in paper wrappers, or held in jars and tiny wooden boxes. Fifty of these were intended primarily for use in the manufacture of glazes and ceramic bodies for pottery, 23 were artists\u2019 colours, and others had medicinal uses (Insley, 2011) (see Figure 4).\nIt is difficult to differentiate in the workshop between philosophy and craft. As Watt struggled to establish the nature of heat, and worked on aspects of chemistry, so here we have furnace crucibles with their last contents solidified inside them, chemical glasswares, protective aprons and eye-glasses, experimental tinplate vessels, and a stove which, as well as containing the fire for those experiments, has a Dutch stove on top for cooking food.\nIn the workshop, then, reality is somewhat at odds with representation. Rather than just Watt of the steam engine, we have Watt the chemist, scientific and musical instrument-maker, even art technician, too. Mechanism and chemistry, philosophy and craft, are closely intermingled. As David Miller has written, \u2018 the theoretical Watt and the \u201ccookbook chemist\u201d Watt\u2026were the same person\u2019 (Miller, 2009). Historians have tended to cut what we will call the Watt \u2018cake\u2019 vertically, to claim him as a craftsman or a philosopher, but the two are not mutually exclusive. The value of the workshop is in presenting a broad horizontal slice of Watt, emphasizing how whatever project he worked on was underpinned by tangible, craft-based work. The difference here, compared to how craft might have been defined by H W Dickinson, for instance, is that rather than being in large part mechanical and steam-based, Watt\u2019s craft was liminal, stretching across different areas of endeavour without ever quite being describable as any one of them in isolation, and being philosophical, chemical, and artistic too (Dickinson, 1935).\nExploring the liminal nature of Watt and his workshop goes to the heart of why Britain was the first nation to industrialise in the 18th century. Much of the recent appraisal of Watt concerns his status as a philosopher and man of science; recent historiography of the industrial revolution has predominantly focused on the creation of a successful knowledge economy, where \u2018useful knowledge\u2019 could be efficiently generated and disseminated to people who could exploit it commercially. The processes by which this could happen have been described by historian Joel Mokyr as the central mechanism of an \u2018Industrial Enlightenment\u2019 (Mokyr, 2009). Out of all the European nations, this useful knowledge was most widely diffused in Britain because it had the greatest numbers, both of places where it could be shared (coffee shops or provincial scientific societies, for example) and of people, described by Peter Jones as \u2018savant-fabricants\u2019, who combined both scientific \u2018why\u2019 with practical \u2018how\u2019 knowledge to put it to industrial and commercial use (Jones, 2008).\nWatt\u2019s workshop is very much the workplace of a savant-fabricant: alongside his philosophical experiments on the nature of heat and chemistry, we find test-firings of creamware ceramics and ingredients for pottery glazes from Watt\u2019s involvement with the Delftfield Pottery in Glasgow, substances including turmeric, gamboge and cochenilla used in dyestuffs, as well as the chemicals needed to make Watt\u2019s letter-copying press the first successful office machine[13]. A copy made by Watt, and preserved in a drawer, records that \u2018Time, labour &amp; money are saved, dispatch &amp; accuracy are attained, and secrecy is preserved by this newly-invented art of copying letters and other writings\u2019[14]. This was only made possible thanks to one of the other items in the workshop, a bundle of hundreds of tiny slips of paper, each recording Watt\u2019s minute variations to the ink recipe used by the copying machine as he refined it. Here are two examples of philosophical experiments turned into viable commercial projects: Delftfield was Scotland\u2019s first successful industrial pottery; and 630 of the copying presses were sold by Watt and his business partner Matthew Boulton in its first year (Kinghorn, 1986) (see Figure 5).\nBritain\u2019s successful transition into an industrial economy depended not just on having an idea, then, but on turning an ephemeral concept into a tangible product. These products \u2013 engines, lathes, hand-tools, furnaces, chemical apparatus, things for measuring and quantifying \u2013 were not just associated directly with science and technology, but were aimed at consumers, too: timepieces, Wedgwood vases, sculpture, cotton cloth and clothing, Boulton silverware and toys, buttons, tableware and a whole panoply of goods. The speed of change was unprecedented. David Landes has commented how \u2018the Englishman of the 1750s was closer in material things to Caesar\u2019s legionnaires than to his own great-grandchildren\u2019 (Landes, 1969). Watt didn\u2019t just exist within a world of purely philosophical ideas, but in an intertwined, very real and physical world filled with a multiplicity of new things.\nThe diversity of objects in the workshop and, importantly, in the Science Museum\u2019s wider collections, allows us to look over Watt\u2019s shoulder and beyond, to other people who played such an important role in Britain\u2019s industrial economy, and who had just as broad a range of interests. The role of craftsmen and artisans was certainly applauded by contemporaries as central to Britain\u2019s industrial success in the 18th century. During the 1730s, Abbe le Blanc wrote how \u2018 The English artisan has the quality, extremely commendable, and peculiar to him which is, never swerve from the degree of perfection in his trade which he is master of\u2019 (Porter, 1982). In 1803, Jean-Baptiste Say wrote that \u2018the enormous wealth of Britain is less owing to her own advances in scientific acquirements\u2026as to the wonderful practical skills of her adventurers in the useful application of knowledge and the superiority of her workmen in rapid and masterly execution\u2019 (Say, 1855). Coming up to the present, Celina Fox has recorded that \u2018modern historians of science and art\u2019 have under-rated Britain\u2019s artisan classes, \u2018 without considering the depth of empirical, practical knowledge they represented\u2019 (Fox, 2009).\nWhat is important to reflect on is that craft knowledge of the type given physical embodiment in Watt\u2019s workshop underpinned all sorts of enterprise, both industrial and philosophical, as well as consumer-oriented and decorative, too. This was a world where people like the 1820s iron-master John Tickle, described by Joshua Field as \u2018an extraordinary character \u2013 a kind of excentric genious a Chymist &amp; a Poet\u2019, could thrive (Hall, 1925-26). Rather than being primarily technological, their stories are deeply human, reflecting that well into the 19th century much manufacturing was small-scale, un-mechanised, and dependent on skilled labour rather than machines, and encompassed huge creativity, cunning, wheeling and dealing. Exploring this wider world also allows us to step away from what John Griffiths described as \u2018Wattolatry\u2019, the worship of Watt (Torrens, 2000).\nFor the Science Museum, exploring this wider world is made possible by the existence of collections which are uniquely rich, and able to tell stories that are populated with a tremendous wealth of people, places, and things. This mixture does, however, raise questions about how we treat the processes of manufacture, in all their forms, within the museum context.\nThe Museum tends to refer to them under the formal title of \u2018engineering\u2019, and they are primarily looked after by the technology and engineering curatorial team. However, we know from evaluation with our visitors that \u2018engineering\u2019 is a word that many people are ambivalent about. A characteristic quote from the 2009 evaluation report commissioned to inform the Museum\u2019s redisplay of Watt\u2019s workshop was: \u2018It\u2019s non-inspirational until you\u2019re told the details and then it\u2019s really interesting\u2019 (Fisher, Monti, 2009). This reflects the findings of a larger study into modern perceptions of engineering carried out by The Royal Academy of Engineering (The Royal Academy of Engineering, 2007). The word \u2019engineering\u2019 comes with a lot of baggage attached. For this reason, interpreting Watt just as the engineer that he became during his working life (and it must be emphasised that he did not start out as an engineer, but became one by building on his wide experiences in instrument-making, pottery and very much else) is rather problematic in the museum context.\nThe solution adopted for Watt\u2019s workshop was to unpick Watt\u2019s approach to making things. Accompanying display cases show items picked from the workshop which would otherwise remain hidden in drawers and boxes. These represent Watt the philosophical entrepreneur, with feet planted firmly in the worlds of experiment and application (or as it was expressed in the exhibition, perhaps a little baldly, \u2018turning science into money\u2019). The connections between consumption and making-machines are represented by placing cut-steel buttons alongside engine models, referencing Matthew Boulton\u2019s claim of \u2018systematising\u2019 the steam engine business \u2018as we have done before in the button manufactory\u2019 (Muirhead, 1858).\nElsewhere in the exhibition are displayed some of Watt\u2019s sculpture collection, including cameos of friends and associates, figures after the Antique, plaster casts of hands, vases and busts, to complement the sculpture-copying machines in the workshop, and present a view of Watt the artist[15]. Pursuing this approach was a conscious strategy to give visitors multiple (perhaps unexpected) handles with which to grasp the central subject of making things, while also conveying the richness of Watt\u2019s multi-faceted world and his status as a savant-fabricant. For the interpretation of Watt and the early industrial revolution, this suggests a need to re-balance away from a deterministic approach where engineers create machines which \u2018have an impact\u2019 on society, towards an approach which is much more contingent, and features a subtle interplay between consumption, aesthetics, entrepreneurship and technology.\nThe question of how to interpret engineering for a museum audience may be one of semantics \u2013 engineering as formally defined is just one aspect of a range of activities that apply tremendous creativity to the design and manufacture of three-dimensional artefacts. The need for formal \u2018engineering\u2019 galleries and other museum outputs remains, as a strategic imperative for the Science Museum Group, and for the UK as a whole. But, by placing them within the context of other approaches to what we can broadly term \u2018making\u2019, the museum can build public interest in this most creative of human activities at many different levels (see Figure 6).\nThis approach has been successful elsewhere. The V&amp;A organised The Power of Making in 2011 (V&amp;A: The power of making [online]). The Design Museum has produced The Future is Here: A New Industrial Revolution (Design Museum: The future is here [online]). The Science Museum has opened 3D: Printing the Future (The Science Museum: 3D printing the future [online]). Let\u2019s not quibble over whether we call it engineering or not, whether it is a process undertaken by chartered engineers or by craftspeople, or that the industry it happens in isn\u2019t necessarily \u2018engineering\u2019. The lesson of Watt\u2019s workshop is that boundaries are there to be crossed; philosophy, sculpture, chemistry and machine-making can happily co-exist in one space. In the 18th century the results were, arguably, the greatest period of economic transformation that Britain has ever seen. The most important thing for the UK now is to get people out there, thinking, designing, making and selling tangible things."},

In 2008, I submitted to the Science Museum\u2019s Programmes Committee a single page outline for a temporary exhibition, provisionally entitled War, Medicine and the Wounded Soldier (Emmens, 2008).\u00a0 This exhibition would reference episodes of frontline military medicine from various points in history, but at its core would be the battlefield medicine then being experienced by Allied forces in Afghanistan and Iraq. Indeed, the inspiration for this exhibition came largely from media reports about British casualties at the time. A typical example being:\nBritish soldier killed in Afghan ambush[1]\nA British NATO soldier was killed and four wounded at the weekend after a Taliban ambush near the southern Afghanistan town of Sangin, the British military said on Sunday.\nIn the wake of such reports, the names of the dead tended to be quickly publicised and their bodies returned home with much ceremony, but I was struck by the references to the wounded. They appeared to largely disappear from the subsequent story. How had they been wounded and what had actually happened to them in the aftermath? What had been their medical treatment? Who had cared for them then and was caring for them now? What places had they been taken to for treatment and by what means had they been transported there? And if they were dealing with life-changing injuries, what might they face in the longer term?\nSuch questions informed my initial exhibition proposal, which was to follow a time-linear narrative. Starting with a split-second \u2018moment of wounding\u2019, the exhibition would follow the journey away from this point, to pick up on events in the seconds, minutes, hours, days and months that followed. It would look at key medical interventions and progressively introduce some of the specialised personnel, technologies and sites of treatment that a wounded soldier might encounter, both during the fight to save their life but also in their longer recovery and rehabilitation. It was envisaged as being focused on intimate, personal stories \u2013 perhaps presenting a single archetypal journey away from that \u2018moment of wounding\u2019.\nAs a curator working closely with our medical collections, I felt such an exhibition would be a real opportunity to present medical treatment as a staged process, rather than as techniques and specialisms which in other contexts might seem unconnected. Instead, distinct forms of practice such as battlefield trauma care, reconstructive surgery and psychological rehabilitation, could all be presented as \u2018mile markers\u2019 in a long journey. A journey that in theory could be taken by a single individual.\nThis proposal was one of a number of ideas for temporary displays put forward by different curators. Although it was well received by the committee, the exhibition was not progressed. However, in its essential concept, narrative structure, the themes it addressed and the underlying issues it raised, it was hugely influential in the development of Wounded several years on.\nIn this later, realised exhibition the wounded remained at the emotional core, with the final object and narrative choices guided by different causes and forms of wounding and their subsequent handling, treatment and rehabilitation. With the extensive holdings of the Science Museum to call on, the material culture associated with these episodes populated the showcases throughout the Wounded exhibition."},

Founded in Bristol in 1939 as an independent research unit, the BNI rapidly established itself as a world-leading centre of expertise in the anatomy, functions, and disorders of the human brain. Within its first two years, the Institute secured its radical credentials by performing Britain\u2019s first trials of electro-convulsive therapy (ECT) and prefrontal leucotomy (lobotomy), before making great leaps forward in fields as diverse as electroencephalography (the recording of the electrical activity of the brain, also known as EEG) and robotic engineering.[1] For many, the BNI\u2019s revolutionary outlook was embodied in its most well-known figure, the neurophysiologist William Grey Walter (1910\u20131977). Over the years, Walter has been variably portrayed as a genius engineer who recognised the untapped potential of the human brainwave (Bladin, 2006), an amateur roboticist who inaugurated a new age of artificial intelligence research from the confines of his garden shed (Holland, 2003), a maverick scientist who dismayed the academic establishment with his repeated refusals to conform (Hayward, 2001, p 616), and a fair-haired \u2018Adonis\u2019 with \u2018an eye for the ladies\u2019 (Cooper and Bird, 1989, pp 49\u201351). Yet the elision of the BNI\u2019s story with the biography of its most prominent \u2018lone male genius\u2019 risks overlooking an intriguing and largely understudied aspect of the Institute\u2019s history: its prominent employment of women as researchers, technicians and laboratory assistants. Between 1950 and 1954, a formative period in the BNI\u2019s burgeoning research programme, 42 per cent of the Institute\u2019s recorded positions were held by women.[2] This figure is particularly striking considering that women constituted 31 per cent of the national workforce during this period and held just 22 per cent of positions within comparable engineering fields (Holloway, 2005, pp 191\u2013197). Furthermore, while many of their counterparts in other scientific workplaces found themselves largely restricted to clerical and administrative duties (Horrocks, 2000, pp 355\u2013361), female staff at the BNI played crucial roles in shaping the Institute\u2019s research agenda. Prominent individuals included psychiatrist Effie Lilian Hutton (1904\u20131956), the BNI\u2019s first Clinical Director who organised many of its early psychosurgical breakthroughs (Hutton, Fleming and Fox, 1941), radiologist Vivian Joan Aldridge (n\u00e9e Dovey, later Walter, 1915\u20131980), who collaborated on a number of the BNI\u2019s foundational EEG projects, including the use of the technique to detect subcortical tumours (Walter and Dovey, 1946), and Janet Shipton (n\u00e9e Attlee, 1923\u2013), who co-authored publications on brainwave frequencies and their relation to variations in human personality (Cooper et al, 1957).[3]Despite these crucial contributions, the voices of female staff are practically absent from the BNI\u2019s historical and archival legacy. This much is evident in the BNI Papers, which, since their donation to the Science Museum, London in 2000, have provided the foundation for the vast majority of historical studies of the Institute and its achievements. Out of the nearly three hundred items of written material that constitute the collection\u2019s main papers, a mere six per cent are derived from female authors. Examining the extensive collection of correspondence, 88 per cent of letters exclusively record communication between men, with just 12 per cent documenting conversations between participants of different genders. The papers do not contain a single instance of communication between two female employees.[4] It is therefore unsurprising that the BNI emerges in most histories as a site of exclusively male scientific enterprise. While these materials offer rich and detailed evidence of male collaborative relationships, right down to debates over what types of nuts and bolts should be used in prototype machines, they offer no such insight into the experiences of women working at the Institute.[5]There is, however, one section of the BNI Papers in which women are not chronically underrepresented: its small collection of photographs and press cuttings. Here, women appear in 47 per cent of images; furthermore, in \u2018portrait\u2019 style photographs, featuring individual members of staff rather than mixed groups, women actually constitute the majority.[6] As such, the visual materials of the collection, while much fewer in number than their written equivalents, provide a representation of women that is at least quantitatively equivalent to their presence within the BNI\u2019s laboratories. It might be tempting, therefore, to view photographic images of the BNI as a tool through which the masculine domination of the archival record can be subverted: a \u2018window\u2019 through which one might access a hidden history of women\u2019s scientific achievements. However, to embrace photographs in this way \u2013 as superior and unproblematic tools of historical empowerment \u2013 would be to overlook a critical tradition of scholarship established in the works of Susan Sontag (1977), John Berger (1980) and Allan Sekula (1981; 1982) among others. Collectively, these critiques rejected notions of the photograph as a direct, neutral and disinterested imprint of reality, and instead advocated for a more rigorous deconstruction of photographic images to reveal their hidden layers of political, social and cultural meaning (see also Flusser, 1983; Tagg, 1988). These approaches to photography have intersected powerfully with historical critiques of gender, with scholars such as Abigail Solomon-Godeau (1991), Carol J Williams (2003), and Laikwan Pang (2007) exploring the critical role of photographic images in the production and naturalisation of gender norms. Over the past decade, historians of photography have sought to adapt and nuance these deconstructionist approaches, conceptualising photographs not just as politically-charged images but also as physical, material objects with distinctive histories of production, collection, and display (Mitman and Wilder, 2016; Klamm, 2016). This \u2018material turn\u2019 in histories of photography has further encouraged scholars to consider not just photographic content \u2013 that is, what a photograph depicts \u2013 but also, photographic agency: what a photograph \u2018does\u2019 in a particular socio-political environment. Within any given space, a photograph might foster a communal sense of identity and purpose (Pollen, 2016), open up spaces for political critique and dissent (Pasternak, 2010; 2013), or stir up visceral, affective and multisensory experiences in its viewers (Edwards, 2010). These critical analyses of materiality and agency are particularly useful when considering the role of photographs in bolstering the authority of scientific research and its practitioners. Scholars have long recognised the privileged place occupied by photography among other visual tools of scientific proof \u2013 such as graphs, diagrams, and models \u2013 by virtue of its distinctive claim to truthfulness and universality (Burri and Dumit, 2007). This is particularly pronounced in the modern neurosciences, where \u2018photographic\u2019 images of the brain produced via techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have played a vital role in establishing the discipline\u2019s cultural authority over ephemeral domains such as consciousness, selfhood, and the emotions (Rose and Abi-Rached, 2013, pp 65\u201381). As such, photographs of research practices are not mere reflections of predetermined scientific authority, but rather produce and enact that authority through their creation, circulation and display. Following these approaches, this article examines the ways in which photographic depictions of women working at the BNI have helped to \u2018frame\u2019 perceptions of their scientific labour, both at the time and in historical accounts since.[7] Such an analysis draws inspiration from a broader re-evaluation of women\u2019s opportunities within the shifting landscapes of post-war employment, as advanced in the work of historians such as Clare Langhamer (2017), Helen McCarthy (2016) and Stephanie Spencer (2005). These investigations have revealed the ways in which women\u2019s career choices continued to be shaped by pervasive cultural ideals of the feminine, the maternal and the domestic in the aftermath of the Second World War (see also Aiston, 2004; Thane, 2004; Todd, 2005). More specifically, this article looks towards recent investigations of women engaged in scientific and technological occupations during this period, a body of work which has self-consciously moved away from biographies of \u2018exceptional\u2019 female scientists in favour of examining the experiences of a much larger class of women upon whose shoulders the daily labour of scientific advancement so often rested (see Hicks, 2017). The article proceeds by examining three different \u2018frames\u2019 through which the labour of women at the BNI was visually presented: firstly, an objectifying depiction of women as the subjects, rather than the practitioners, of neuroscientific research; secondly, the elision of women\u2019s scientific, domestic and familial roles; and, finally, the visual equation of women\u2019s labour with that of the machine. These frames were not arbitrarily imposed by visiting photographers, but rather emerged from complex negotiations between those involved in the photographic exchange, their surrounding institutions and patrons, and broader cultural patterns of gendered meaning (see Jordanova, 2000, p 23; Sidlauskas, 2013, p 36). By examining the photographs of the BNI Collection in this way, this article seeks to provide not merely a series of hostile deconstructions \u2013 in line with the \u2018rigid negativity\u2019 diagnosed by Susan Linfield (2010, pp 4\u201312) as the prevailing tone of postmodern critiques of photography \u2013 but rather a creative engagement with ongoing debates among historians and museum professionals about how best to represent the voices of female workers in narratives of scientific progress. Ultimately, this article suggests that historical analyses and museum exhibitions must do more than simply reassert the primacy of women\u2019s labour in the face of its historical devaluation; by placing photographs in different kinds of material and intellectual settings, such practices can also highlight the subtle and varied processes through which this labour was devalued in the first place."},

The MIT differential analyser was one of many that Bush had designed to mechanise the arithmetic processes of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (Crank, 1947, p 1). With eight integrating units, Bush\u2019s differential analyser also mechanised the processes of calculus alongside these arithmetical functions, allowing the machine to numerically solve differential equations for which there was no formal solution (Crank, 1947, p 2). Observing the various gearing components, shafts, and wheels of this new mechanical computer, Hartree commented that the machine looked as if \u2018someone had been enjoying himself with an extra-large Meccano set\u2019 (Froese Fischer, 2003). On his return to the United Kingdom, Hartree immediately set about working with his research student, Arthur Porter, to develop their own version of the differential analyser. The Hartree Differential Analyser \u2013 created using the children\u2019s construction toy Meccano \u2013 helped to reduce the complexity of differential equations that Hartree had researched during the First World War with his father, William Hartree.[3] After completing their differential analyser, Hartree and Porter used it to mechanise the process of integrating equations related to Hartree\u2019s work on the Self-Consistent Field Theory.[4]\nIn contrast to Bush\u2019s analyser, Hartree built his version with a single integrating unit (later increased to three and then four integrators). He described the Hartree Differential Analyser as having \u2018exceeded all expectations\u2019, increasing the accuracy rate of resolving equations compared to previously hand-computed processes (Hartree and Porter, 1935). The Meccano analyser could be configured to resolve a variety of differential equations.[5] It provided solutions to these equations \u2014 relating to fluid mechanics \u2014 through explaining changes in the momentum of an object as it moved through a space that contained different pressure levels and viscosities.[6] In comparison to the methodology of hand-computed equations, the Differential Analyser translated equations mechanically through the units of the machine from the input table to the wheel-and-disk integrating unit and through the torque amplifier, before automatically drawing the solutions as a curved line on the output table. Despite being created as a model to demonstrate this new methodology, the Hartree Differential Analyser ultimately \u2018...turned out to be more than a demonstration model\u2026 [it was] capable of solving many equations with a considerable degree of accuracy\u2019 (Hawks, 1934, p 441). The analyser initially had one, then three, then four integrating units, and was used by Porter for his MSc Thesis in 1935, calculating the atomic wave functions of Chromium atoms. The success of this Meccano model led Hartree to construct a larger differential analyser \u2014 the Manchester Machine, with eight integrating units \u2014 in 1935 with Metropolitan Vickers Ltd. However, instead of using Meccano, the pieces of the Manchester Machine were made to Hartree\u2019s specifications by Metropolitan Vickers Ltd., helping to increase the mechanical accuracy of the machine, which was applied to many problems in the final years before the Second World War. The problems that the machine was used to resolve in these years related to the Control Theory, Heat-Flow Thermodynamics, and Fluid Dynamics, as well as being used to resolve more straightforward calculations that related to railway timetables. While the original Meccano model analyser was stored in Hartree\u2019s study, he and other members of the Servo Panel used the Manchester Machine at the Ministry of Supply throughout the Second World War. A number of these analogue machines were built in England and America in the years before the Second World War, and the increased requirement of computation and processing power during the war led to their use to resolve a number of equations relating to anti-aircraft and ballistics trajectories.[7]\nHartree\u2019s focus shifted from analogue to digital computing methods as the war progressed, leading to his move to the Mathematics Section at the National Physical Laboratory. Working with a number of contemporaries, including John Womersley, Alan Turing, and John von Neumann, Hartree helped to develop the Colossus computer, the ENIAC, and the EDVAC in the final years of the war, advising and lecturing countries and governments on the benefits of this new system. His move away from the analogue computing and the Servo Panel meant that the running of the Manchester Machine shifted to his research students, Nicholas Eyres, Phyllis Nicholson, Jack Howlett, and Jack Michel, who continued to use it throughout the war. It remained in use at the National Physical Laboratory after the war, becoming available for collection in 1973, when half of it was collected by Jane Pugh at the Science Museum, with the other half collected by the Science and Industry Museum in Manchester.\u00a0\nAfter the Second World War, Hartree resumed his academic career at the University of Manchester, before being appointed Plummer Professor of Mathematical Physics at the University of Cambridge in 1946. His inaugural lecture \u2018Calculating Machines: Recent and Prospective Developments and their impact on Mathematical Physics\u2019, focused on his experiences in developing both analogue and digital computing systems. As part of his move to Cambridge, the original Meccano differential analyser that he had built with Arthur Porter was dismantled. Although his work increasingly focused on digital computing, Hartree salvaged some Meccano parts from the differential analyser and used them to rebuild a portion of the original model. He removed the input and output tables, turning this new version of the machine into a device that could be programmed with a single differential equation to demonstrate the mechanical methodology of integration. He made these changes so that he could easily transport the machine around the country to demonstrate the principles of mechanical integration in his public lectures, which he did between 1947 and 1949. The equation that he chose to pre-program into this new version measured tractive force as applied to railways, which led it (along with the glass case that Hartree transported it around in) to be nicknamed the \u2018Trainbox\u2019. Initially loaned to the Science Museum in 1949, it is the Trainbox version of the Hartree Differential Analyser that forms the subject of this paper."},

It is quite large \u2013 67 x 31 x 36cm \u2013 about the size of a desktop printer, and heavy, but it has a handle at each end to make it portable. It was formerly glazed, and the broken fragments of glass are still stored with the object. Four green felt pads on the underside of the object suggest it was treated as a decorative object, and possibly placed on valuable wooden furniture (see Figure 4).\nEach card shows the demand for electricity in megawatts (MW) for each half-hour period over 24 hours, from 2 October 1951 to 30 April 1954 (see Figure 5). Despite the accompanying key showing a seven-day week, there are only cards for Monday to Friday, mass printed in the five colours, and then annotated with a date stamp and a handwritten prefix for the day of the week.\nThe time of sunrise and sunset is marked on each card, as is temperature and \u2018remarks\u2019 on the weather. These remarks match the daily weather summaries for the past 24 hours for Manchester, published daily in the Manchester Guardian (see Figure 6), and were written onto the cards in more than one pen and handwriting. Rainfall is occasionally noted, but other boxes for \u2018Wind, direction\u2019, \u2018Wind, force\u2019 and \u2018Visibility\u2019 are never completed.\nThere are also occasional annotations written onto the graphical section of the card, two of which give clues about the geographic area from which the data was drawn. The two cards shown in Figure 7 refer to \u2018Barton\u2019 and \u2018generating stations\u2019 in the plural suggesting the area included Barton power station, and at least another. Using data on plant capacity from Swale\u2019s Forerunners of the North Western Electricity Board (Swale, 1963), and the value of the highest peak demand (450 MW on Tuesday 2 December 1952), we surmise that the meter readings were taken from generating stations in the Board\u2019s Sub-Area Number 1 \u2013 Manchester, the generating stations that were owned by Manchester Corporation before nationalisation in 1948.\nTraces of pencil and red pen ink across the profile of cards suggest that the data values were drawn onto the card before being cut by scissors or a clipper (see Figures 8 and 9). The height of the card from which they were cut is evidenced by an offcut sandwiched in the middle of the model (see Figure 10) \u2013 the maximum demand printed on the card is 640 MW.\nTaken together, evidence from the object led to the following interpretations. The chart was probably assembled day-by-day, or for a group of days, rather than all at once, and the values were cut into the cards by hand \u2013 a time consuming task. Daylight hours and weather variables were important enough to record, and the whole chart was probably on display for some period after initial construction. We were not able to find a similar object with which to compare it for Fleming\u2019s (1974) step of \u2018evaluation\u2019, but it seemed to have a purpose beyond the recording of daily load curves \u2013 a need to see the data in relationship, or trends. An analysis of these trends would also fulfil Fleming\u2019s third step of \u2018cultural analysis\u2019: the relationship of the object to its culture."}
